# Overall Project Monthly Summary (October 2024)

## Executive Summary
This month, our efforts focused on strategic planning to enhance the scalability of the Superchain. We identified and began designing a solution for a critical bottleneck in our upgrade process, laying the essential groundwork to make onboarding new chains more efficient and cost-effective.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Preparing the Superchain for Scalable Growth**
*Strategic Importance: To support a rapidly growing ecosystem of chains, we must make the process of deploying and upgrading them as efficient and low-cost as possible, removing friction for the entire Superchain.*
-   Advanced the architectural design for a new, more efficient fault proof system that will significantly lower the gas costs associated with onboarding new chains. This foundational work in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) is critical for streamlining future upgrades across the ecosystem.
-   Prioritized the refactoring of core dispute game contracts, which are currently a major impediment to upgrading many chains at once. This ensures that improving the efficiency of managing a growing number of chains is a key focus for future development in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
October's work centered on foundational planning to improve the Superchain's upgrade process and long-term scalability. While no major features were merged, significant progress was made on the design for a more efficient architecture.
-   A key issue was prioritized to track the refactoring of fault proof contracts ([#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421)), which currently incur high gas costs and limit the number of chains that can be upgraded simultaneously.
-   The technical design for this refactor was updated to reflect a new approach that will allow dispute game contracts to be shared across chains, removing a significant bottleneck ([design-docs/pull/275](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/275)).
