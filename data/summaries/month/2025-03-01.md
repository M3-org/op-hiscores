# Overall Project Monthly Summary (March 2025)

## Executive Summary
March was a month focused on laying the groundwork for future growth and stability by improving the developer experience. We initiated key projects to make it easier for new teams to join the Superchain ecosystem and to enhance the efficiency of our internal development processes. This foundational work is critical for scaling our community and strengthening the core protocol.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Improving the Onboarding Experience for Superchain Builders**
*Strategic Importance: To grow the Superchain, it must be simple and clear for external developers to launch and test their own OP Stack chains.*
-   Based on community feedback, we began a major overhaul of our documentation for setting up a testnet. This work in [ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs) will provide a clear, modern guide using the `op-deployer` tool, removing confusion caused by outdated instructions.

**Strengthening Core Infrastructure and Internal Tooling**
*Strategic Importance: Proactively maintaining our core systems and improving internal developer tools ensures long-term security and allows us to build and ship features more efficiently.*
-   To ensure the security and reliability of our proving system, planning began in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to update the Cannon toolchain for compatibility with the latest version of Go.
-   An initiative was started in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to streamline the workflow for engineers working with both Go and Solidity, aiming to automate repetitive tasks and reduce potential errors.

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/docs
Work in March centered on improving the developer experience for external teams building on the OP Stack, with a focus on documentation for testnet deployment.
-   A new initiative was launched to create clear documentation for setting up an OP Stack testnet using the `op-deployer` tool, prompted by community feedback highlighting confusion with older methods ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1530)).
-   Active discussions around this new documentation effort helped identify key technical complexities, such as high RPC usage and the specifics of dispute game deployment, which will be addressed in the new guides ([#1539](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1539)).

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
Development focused on forward-looking planning to enhance core infrastructure and improve the internal developer toolchain.
-   Proactive work was scoped to ensure the Cannon proving system remains compatible with the upcoming Go 1.24 toolchain, maintaining system health and security ([#14760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14760)).
-   The EVM Safety team initiated a plan to reduce friction for developers working across Go and Solidity by automating the process of updating code structures, which will improve efficiency and reduce errors ([#14976](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14976)).
