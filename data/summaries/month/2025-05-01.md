# Overall Project Monthly Summary (May 2025)

## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
May was a period of strategic planning and foundational groundwork across the Optimism ecosystem. Instead of shipping new features, development efforts focused on initiating critical upgrades and organizing future workstreams to enhance protocol security, improve Superchain interoperability, and increase overall code quality. This preparatory phase lays the essential groundwork for major protocol enhancements planned for the coming months.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Strengthening Protocol Security and the Superchain**
*Strategic Importance: This work is fundamental to ensuring the long-term security of the protocol and advancing the vision of an interconnected, interoperable Superchain.*
-   Began exploration into a new protocol design with the introduction of a draft "Flashblock Spec" in [ethereum-optimism/specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs).
-   Initiated planning for necessary changes to the Fault Proof system, a critical component for protocol security and compatibility, in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).
-   Formalized the workstream for the upcoming "Interop proofs" upgrade, a key initiative for enhancing cross-chain capabilities within the Superchain, in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).

**Improving Code Quality and Maintainability**
*Strategic Importance: Investing in code quality and clear documentation makes the system more reliable, reduces future bugs, and allows developers to build more efficiently.*
-   Kicked off a significant refactoring of the L2 test suite to improve its structure, quality, and documentation in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).
-   Started an effort to improve operational procedures by proposing a refactor of the network upgrade runbook for better clarity and consistency in [ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra).
-   Consolidated project tracking for a major development pattern to provide a clearer, more streamlined view of progress for all contributors in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
-   Began foundational work to enhance the Fault Proof system by opening an issue to investigate required OPCM changes ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15789)).
-   Established a formal tracking issue to organize the "Interop proofs U17 proof upgrade" workstream, a key Superchain initiative ([#15980](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15980)).
