# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2024)

## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
December was a period of strategic planning and foundational groundwork rather than active feature development. Efforts focused on identifying future protocol enhancements and troubleshooting key components, setting a clear direction for improving protocol security and developer experience in the new year.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Strengthening Protocol Security and Determinism**
This initiative is critical for ensuring the core reliability and security of the OP Stack, making interactions between L1 and L2 more predictable and robust.
-   Strategic planning was initiated in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to improve how L1 events influence L2 consensus, aiming to enhance the determinism of the protocol.

**Enhancing Smart Contract Capabilities**
To empower developers and expand the possibilities of building on the Superchain, we are exploring new architectural patterns for smart contracts.
-   Design work began in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) on a "Creator" pattern, which will provide builders with more advanced tools for contract development.

**Improving Developer Tooling and Support**
A smooth and well-supported developer experience is essential for ecosystem growth, and this month highlighted the strength of community-driven problem-solving.
-   A critical configuration issue with the `op-proposer` was diagnosed and resolved through community collaboration in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), providing a crucial fix for developers setting up their own nodes.

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
Activity in the core protocol repository was centered on planning for future work and troubleshooting existing components. While no new code was merged, several key issues were opened that will guide development in the coming months.

-   **Protocol Design:** An issue was opened to track the potential implementation of a nonce for L1 events that influence consensus, a step toward greater protocol security and determinism ([#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13543)).
-   **Smart Contract Architecture:** Planning began for a "Creator" pattern for contracts, which would involve changes to the OPCM and introduce new smart contract design possibilities ([#13168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13168)).
-   **Community Troubleshooting:** A significant configuration failure with the `op-proposer` was reported and diagnosed through community discussion. The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration of the game factory address and an incorrect flag, with the solution confirmed by multiple contributors ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13502)).
