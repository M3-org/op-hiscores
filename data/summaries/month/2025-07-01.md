# Overall Project Monthly Summary (July 2025)

## Executive Summary
July was a month of execution and strategic preparation, defined by the successful finalization of the U16 network upgrade and a concerted effort to strengthen the Superchain's foundations. While delivering on immediate roadmap items, the team also laid significant groundwork for future protocol enhancements, including a configurable minimum base fee and the flashblocks rollout, while simultaneously expanding the ecosystem with new chain integrations, tokens, and developer tooling.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Executing the U16 Upgrade and Maturing Operations**
*To ensure the continued evolution and security of the network, this month focused on successfully delivering a major network upgrade and improving our operational readiness.*
- The U16 network upgrade was finalized and successfully executed on-chain, marking a key milestone in the protocol's roadmap ([superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops)).
- The Security Council's operational readiness was enhanced by overhauling the rehearsal system and creating new playbooks for the next cohort of signers ([superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops)).
- Documentation was prepared and released for the Upgrade 16, providing node operators with consensus configurations and execution dates to ensure a smooth transition ([docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs)).

**Strengthening Core Infrastructure and Test Reliability**
*To improve the stability and security of the OP Stack, we invested heavily in making our core services more robust and our testing frameworks more efficient.*
- The project's testing framework was overhauled to run tests in parallel, dramatically improving CI efficiency and reliability ([infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra)).
- Core network services were enhanced with more granular controls for rate limiting and timeouts, bolstering performance and configurability ([infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra)).
- The transaction pool in `op-geth` was improved to better handle chain reorganizations and enforce gas limits, increasing network stability ([op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth)).
- A major effort across the project closed a large backlog of long-standing issues related to sequencer stability, significantly improving the health of the codebase ([op-analytics](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics), [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth), [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry), and others).

**Expanding the Superchain Ecosystem and Developer Tooling**
*To foster growth and utility, we focused on integrating new chains and assets into the Superchain while providing better tools and documentation for builders.*
- The ecosystem was expanded by adding comprehensive support for the Nethermind client, giving node operators more choice in their setup ([docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs)).
- The Superchain grew with the re-integration of Celo mainnet into the registry and data pipelines ([superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry), [op-analytics](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics)).
- The "Verbs" project, a new SDK to simplify integrating common financial actions, was rapidly developed from concept to a working UI with wallet integration ([ecosystem](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem)).
- The list of supported assets on the Superchain was expanded to include CO, Super, QUICK, and TOWNS ([ethereum-optimism.github.io](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io)).

**Preparing for Future Protocol Enhancements**
*To drive the protocol forward, significant planning and foundational work began on the next wave of features focused on network economics and performance.*
- Foundational work began on a configurable "Min Base Fee," a key feature for improving the network's economic model ([op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth), [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs), [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
- New design proposals were introduced for future economic mechanisms, including revenue sharing and a fee to address L1 data congestion ([design-docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs)).
- Detailed plans were established for monitoring and alerting for the upcoming flashblocks rollout, ensuring operational readiness for this key performance feature ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Ecosystem-Wide Migration to Blockscout**
A major coordinated effort was completed to migrate all block explorer links and dependencies from Etherscan to Blockscout across multiple repositories, including `docs`, `superchain-registry`, `community-hub`, and `op-analytics`. This initiative standardizes a key piece of user-facing infrastructure across the entire Superchain ecosystem.

**"Min Base Fee" Initiative**
Planning and implementation for a configurable minimum base fee demonstrated strong cross-team collaboration. The effort involved formal specification work in `specs`, design analysis in `design-docs`, implementation in `op-geth`, and overall tracking in the `optimism` repository, ensuring a cohesive approach to delivering this new economic feature.

**Flashblocks Rollout Preparation**
Preparing for the flashblocks rollout required extensive coordination. The `optimism` and `specs` repositories were used to define detailed monitoring and alerting requirements, while `infra` worked on deployment and `proxyd` enhancements, and `superchain-ops` hosted discussions on operational readiness.
