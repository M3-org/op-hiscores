# Overall Project Monthly Summary (November 2025)

## Executive Summary
November was a month of consolidation and strategic planning, focused on enhancing the core protocol's stability and reliability. While no major features were released, significant progress was made in hardening the existing system through bug fixes and testing improvements, alongside a coordinated effort to design a more robust transaction submission process for the OP Stack.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Enhancing Protocol Stability and Reliability**
*Strategic Importance: Ensuring the network remains secure, predictable, and dependable for all users and developers is a top priority.*
-   The dispute monitoring system was upgraded with better error tracking, providing clearer insight into potential issues with network nodes ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
-   A critical bug in the contract upgrade process was resolved, ensuring that security parameters are set correctly during network updates ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
-   Significant effort was invested in improving the stability of the automated acceptance testing suite, which helps catch bugs before they can impact the network ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).

**Planning for More Reliable Transaction Processing**
*Strategic Importance: To ensure transactions are included on-chain quickly and cost-effectively, especially during periods of high network congestion.*
-   A key technical discussion progressed on a proposal to make the `op-batcher` more intelligent when setting transaction fees. This planned improvement aims to prevent transaction delays during fee spikes ([ethereum-optimism/design-docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs)).

**Growing the Superchain Ecosystem**
*Strategic Importance: Expanding the variety of assets and applications available on Superchain networks like Base attracts more users and builders.*
-   Community members submitted proposals to add a new creator coin to the Base network, demonstrating continued interest in expanding the ecosystem's asset base ([ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io)).

**Maintaining Project Health and Automation**
*Strategic Importance: Keeping our codebase and internal processes efficient ensures the project can continue to develop and scale effectively.*
-   Routine maintenance was performed to keep automatically generated code within the Superchain Registry up-to-date, ensuring data consistency ([ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry)).
-   The documentation team analyzed repository performance metrics to gain insights into issue and pull request response times, supporting ongoing process improvements ([ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Designing a More Resilient Transaction Batcher**
A coordinated discussion took place across the `design-docs`, `superchain-registry`, and `ethereum-optimism.github.io` repositories regarding a core component of the OP Stack, the `op-batcher`. The goal is to improve how it handles transaction fees during periods of high L1 network activity. This collaborative planning effort led to a promising proposal for a more dynamic fee strategy, laying the groundwork for a future implementation that will enhance the reliability of transaction submissions for all OP Stack chains.

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
The `optimism` repository focused on hardening the protocol through bug fixes, testing improvements, and enhanced monitoring.
-   Enhanced the dispute monitor (`op-dispute-mon`) with new Prometheus metrics to track RPC endpoint errors, improving observability ([#17622](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17622)).
-   Fixed a bug in the contract upgrade manager (`opcm.upgrade`) to ensure the `CANNON_KONA` initial bond is correctly set ([#18100](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18100)).
-   Resolved a bug in the `op-acceptance-tests` that caused incorrect operator fee calculations when running against `isthmus` networks ([#18104](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18104)).
-   Opened new pull requests to address test flakiness and improve the overall reliability of the acceptance test suite ([#18106](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18106), [#18107](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18107)).

### ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io
Activity centered on ecosystem asset proposals and a key technical discussion about transaction fee management.
-   Community members submitted several proposals to add the "MR_LIGHTSPEED Creator Coin on Base" to the ecosystem ([#1234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1234), [#1235](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1235), [#1236](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1236)).
-   A significant discussion continued on improving the `op-batcher`'s transaction inclusion strategy by implementing a "decay" mechanism for priority fees during busy periods ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102)).

### ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry
Work focused on routine maintenance and advancing the discussion on transaction batching improvements.
-   Automated pull requests were opened to keep generated code up-to-date, ensuring the registry remains synchronized ([#1137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1137), [#1138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1138)).
-   Contributed to the ongoing discussion on improving blob priority fee tracking in the `op-batcher` to enhance transaction inclusion rates ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18102)).

### ethereum-optimism/design-docs
This repository was the hub for a strategic discussion on improving the OP Stack's core transaction submission logic.
-   The primary activity was a focused discussion on optimizing the `op-batcher`'s handling of blob priority fees, with a proposal for a more dynamic fee adjustment mechanism to improve performance under network congestion ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102)).

### ethereum-optimism/docs
Activity was focused on internal process management and performance analysis.
-   Generated and closed monthly metrics reports for October 2025 to track statistics on issue and pull request handling times ([#1825](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1825), [#1826](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1826)).
