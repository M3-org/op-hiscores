# Overall Project Monthly Summary (November 2024)

## Executive Summary
This month, the team focused on enhancing the efficiency and stability of the core protocol. While no new code was merged, a key investigation into the fault-proof system identified a significant performance bottleneck, leading to a new initiative aimed at reducing the system's operational load and improving its long-term health.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes
**Improving Protocol Efficiency and Stability**
This work is crucial for ensuring the long-term health and cost-effectiveness of the Optimism protocol, particularly the components that secure the chain.
- An investigation into the `op-challenger` component, which is part of our fault-proof system, identified a performance issue causing excessive load on L1 nodes. This discovery in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) is the first step toward a more efficient and sustainable security model.

## Repository Spotlights
### ethereum-optimism/optimism
Development activity focused on analysis and performance optimization rather than new features. The primary outcome was the identification of an efficiency issue within the fault-proof system.
- A new issue was opened to address the high number of calls the `op-challenger` makes to the L1 node. The proposal suggests adding an option to limit how often games are processed to reduce system load and improve performance ([#13090](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13090)).
