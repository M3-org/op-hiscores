# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2025)

## Executive Summary
December saw major progress in advancing the OP Stack's future capabilities, with a strategic decision to integrate ZK-based fault proofs directly into the `op-challenger`. While development moved forward on expanding the Superchain and improving developer infrastructure, the team also focused on addressing critical node synchronization issues impacting network operators, demonstrating a dual commitment to innovation and operational stability.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Advancing Protocol Security with ZK Fault Proofs**
_This initiative prepares the OP Stack for a new generation of fault proofs, enhancing the security, decentralization, and capabilities of the Superchain._
-   A key strategic decision was made to integrate ZK game challenging directly into the existing `op-challenger` component, streamlining development and establishing a clear path forward ([specs#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18322)).
-   The core `op-challenger` was significantly enhanced to support ZK games, with new functionality for challenging proposals, resolving games, and reclaiming bonds ([optimism#18432](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18432), [#18467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18467)).
-   A large volume of planning and implementation issues related to ZK proofs were closed across the project, marking the completion of a major feature epic and freeing up resources for the next phase of development ([superchain-registry#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18319), [#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18427)).

**Strengthening Network Stability and Reliability**
_Ensuring the network is stable and reliable for node operators, developers, and users is a top priority for maintaining trust and enabling growth._
-   Actively investigated and debugged critical `op-node` synchronization issues reported by operators on Base Mainnet and other chains to restore stability ([infra#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18468), [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18510)).
-   Fixed a recurring bug in the `op-batcher` that affected its ability to handle large transaction backlogs, improving data submission reliability to L1 ([optimism#18344](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18344)).
-   Identified and scheduled a fix for a data consistency risk in `proxyd` that could cause it to serve stale block data, proactively hardening infrastructure ([infra#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/501)).

**Growing the Superchain Ecosystem**
_Expanding the network of interoperable chains is central to the Superchain vision, creating a more cohesive and powerful blockchain ecosystem._
-   The Superchain network grew with the official integration of Base as an executed upgrade and the advancement of Worldchain's integration on the Sepolia testnet ([superchain-ops#1312](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1312), [#1284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1284)).
-   Began formalizing the Superchain's configuration by introducing a `SuperchainDefinition` type, creating a more structured and verifiable foundation for future chains ([specs#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/867)).
-   Formally integrated the Custom Gas Token (CGT) system as a standard feature, enabling more flexible economic models for chains building on the OP Stack ([optimism#18405](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18405)).

**Improving Developer Experience and Documentation**
_Providing excellent tools and clear documentation empowers builders on the OP Stack, accelerating innovation and adoption._
-   Significantly improved documentation quality by consolidating guides, fixing broken links, and updating content for recent network upgrades like Jovian ([docs#1879](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1879), [#1907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1907), [#1900](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1900)).
-   Refactored and streamlined CI/CD workflows to improve the reliability and maintainability of the development pipeline across multiple repositories ([infra#519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/519), [optimism#18443](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18443)).
-   Enhanced the `op-acceptor` testing tool with new options to improve its flexibility for complex test conditions ([infra#520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/520)).

**Supporting Public Goods Through RetroPGF**
_Funding public goods is a core part of Optimism's mission to build a sustainable and positive-sum ecosystem._
-   Finalized the results for RetroPGF Season 8, Milestone 10, by refining data queries and weightings for onchain builders, ensuring a fair and accurate allocation of funds ([Retro-Funding#87](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/87), [#88](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/88)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

-   **ZK Challenger Integration:** A major coordinated effort culminated this month with the strategic decision to integrate ZK game support into `op-challenger`. This decision, tracked in the `specs` repository, unlocked a wave of implementation work in `optimism` and the closure of related planning issues across `infra`, `superchain-ops`, `docs`, `superchain-registry`, and `op-analytics`, demonstrating a unified push to advance the protocol's fault-proof capabilities.
-   **`op-node` Stability Triage:** In response to reports from node operators, a cross-functional effort was launched to diagnose critical `op-node` synchronization failures. Discussions and debugging efforts spanned nearly every repository, from `infra` and `optimism` to `docs` and `design-docs`, highlighting a project-wide commitment to supporting the community and ensuring network health.
-   **Superchain Configuration:** Architectural work to formalize the Superchain's structure saw collaboration between the `specs`, `infra`, `ecosystem`, and `op-geth` repositories. The effort to port the `SuperchainConfig` type aims to create a single source of truth for chain configurations, improving consistency and maintainability across the ecosystem.
