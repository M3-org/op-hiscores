# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2025)

## Executive Summary
December was a month of dual focus, balancing future innovation with present-day stability. We made a significant strategic leap forward by solidifying our approach to ZK fault proofs and completing a large volume of implementation work, while simultaneously dedicating resources to diagnosing and addressing critical node synchronization issues affecting network operators.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Advancing Protocol Security with ZK Fault Proofs**
_Goal: To enhance the security and versatility of the OP Stack by integrating Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs into our fault-proof system, a key step towards a more robust and decentralized Superchain._
-   A major strategic decision was made to integrate ZK game challenging directly into the existing `op-challenger`, streamlining development and establishing a clear path forward. This was a key outcome discussed across multiple repositories, including [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs) and [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth).
-   The core `op-challenger` component was heavily refactored in [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to support ZK games, including the ability to challenge proposals ([#18467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18467)), resolve games ([#18464](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18464)), and reclaim bonds ([#18465](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18465)).
-   A large volume of planning and implementation issues related to ZK proof generation, configuration, and bond handling were closed across repositories like [superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops), [op-analytics](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics), and [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry), marking the completion of a major feature epic ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18322)).

**Strengthening Network Stability and Reliability**
_Goal: To ensure the OP Stack is robust and reliable for all node operators and users by actively investigating and resolving critical infrastructure issues._
-   A high-priority `op-node` synchronization bug affecting operators on Base Mainnet and other chains is under active investigation across the project ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18468), [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18510)), with maintainers and the community collaborating to diagnose the root cause.
-   A critical bug in the `op-batcher` that could affect transaction processing during periods of high load was fixed in [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) ([#18344](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18344)), improving network resilience.
-   A potential data consistency risk in `proxyd` that could serve stale block data was identified for a fix in January, demonstrating a proactive approach to infrastructure integrity ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/501)).

**Expanding the Superchain Ecosystem**
_Goal: To grow a vibrant and interoperable network of chains by integrating new partners and standardizing the configuration process for the Superchain._
-   The Superchain continued to expand with the official integration of Base as an executed upgrade in [superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops) ([#1312](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1312)).
-   Progress was made on integrating Worldchain, with key handback tasks completed on the Sepolia testnet ([#1284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1284), [#1315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1315)).
-   Work began in [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs) to formalize a `SuperchainDefinition` type ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/867)), a crucial step towards creating a more structured and verifiable definition for all chains in the ecosystem.

**Improving the Developer and Operator Experience**
_Goal: To empower builders by providing comprehensive documentation, streamlined tooling, and reliable infrastructure._
-   The official documentation received a major overhaul in [docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs), with community guides consolidated ([#1879](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1879)) and widespread formatting and navigation issues fixed ([#1901](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1901), [#1907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1907)).
-   CI/CD workflows were refactored across [infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra) ([#519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/519)) and [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) ([#18443](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18443)) to improve reliability, security, and maintainability of the development pipeline.
-   The Custom Gas Token (CGT) system was formally integrated as a system feature in [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) ([#18405](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18405)), removing the developer flag and making it an official part of the OP Stack.

**Supporting Public Goods through RetroPGF**
_Goal: To foster a sustainable ecosystem by funding projects that provide value to the Optimism Collective and the broader Ethereum community._
-   Work was completed in [Retro-Funding](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding) to finalize the results for RetroPGF Season 8, Milestone 10, including refining data queries and weightings for onchain builders ([#87](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/87), [#88](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/88)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

-   **ZK Fault Proof Integration:** The month's largest coordinated effort was the push to advance ZK fault proofs. The strategic decision to use `op-challenger` was discussed in [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs) and [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth), with core implementation work in [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), deployment preparations in [superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops), and configuration updates in [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry). This resulted in the closure of a large, cross-repository epic of related issues, demonstrating a unified push on a key technical priority.
-   **`op-node` Stability Investigation:** The critical `op-node` synchronization issue ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18468)) triggered a project-wide response. The issue was discussed and tracked across nearly every repository, from [infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra) and [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to [docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs) and [superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops), highlighting a coordinated effort between maintainers and the community to diagnose and resolve a pressing operational challenge.
