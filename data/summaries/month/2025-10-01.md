# Overall Project Monthly Summary (October 2025)

October was a month of significant achievement and focused preparation, as we officially concluded the Isthmus network upgrade while simultaneously hardening the protocol and advancing key features for the next major upgrade, Jovian. Efforts to improve system stability resulted in critical fixes to our transaction infrastructure and fault-proof monitoring, while a major overhaul of our testing framework will ensure greater reliability for all future development.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Finalizing a Major Milestone and Hardening the Protocol**
_Goal: To ensure the long-term stability and security of the OP Stack by completing past upgrades, resolving system-wide instabilities, and investing in automated testing._
-   The **Isthmus Upgrade** was officially finalized, marking the successful conclusion of a major network-wide initiative across multiple repositories including [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), [infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra), and [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs).
-   A major overhaul of our testing infrastructure was completed in [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), introducing a "flake-shaker" system and nightly fuzz testing to automatically detect and prevent unstable code from being merged.
-   Critical stability issues with the **Flashblocks** service were resolved across the stack, fixing a problem that caused lost transactions and improving coordination with external RPC providers.

**Preparing for the Jovian Network Upgrade**
_Goal: To develop and test the core components of the upcoming Jovian upgrade, which will introduce new economic models and efficiency improvements to the protocol._
-   Significant progress was made on the **Data Availability (DA) Footprint Limit**, a feature designed to manage L1 data costs. Work included updating specifications in [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs), implementing the logic in [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth), and completing extensive testing.
-   A consensus-breaking change to the **operator fee formula** was implemented in [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), a key economic update for the Jovian upgrade.
-   Deployment tooling was updated in [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to support the next generation of dispute games, a core component of our fault-proof system.

**Improving Security and Decentralization**
_Goal: To enhance the robustness of the OP Stack's security mechanisms, particularly the fault-proof system that ensures the integrity of the L2 chain._
-   The dispute monitoring system (`op-dispute-mon`) was significantly improved in [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to prevent it from raising false alarms when monitoring rollup nodes that are out of sync, making the entire fault-proof system more reliable.
-   New architectural documents were created in [design-docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs) to formalize the design of new components like the Kona Rollup Node and a protocol-enshrined revenue-sharing mechanism.

**Growing the Superchain and Improving Developer Experience**
_Goal: To make it easier for developers to build on the OP Stack and to expand the ecosystem of assets and applications across the Superchain._
-   The developer experience was enhanced with a new practical guide for creating L2 rollups and a major restructuring of our documentation in [docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs).
-   A new feature was added in [superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops) to enable direct L1-to-L2 function calls through the Optimism Portal, improving cross-chain interoperability.
-   The Superchain ecosystem was expanded with the addition of numerous new tokens, including ATTN, MIRROR, DSTRX, RIO, and DRIP, in [ethereum-optimism.github.io](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Resolving Flashblocks Instability**
A coordinated effort across eight repositories, including [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth), [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry), and [community-hub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub), resolved a critical stability issue in the Flashblocks system, which is used for private transaction ordering. The fix involved upgrading core components, improving alerts, and coordinating with external RPC providers to ensure a smooth rollout, preventing lost transactions and hardening a key piece of infrastructure.

**Implementing the Data Availability (DA) Footprint Limit**
Work on this key feature for the upcoming Jovian upgrade required tight collaboration. The protocol rules were updated in [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs), the core logic was implemented in our client [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth), and a suite of acceptance and unit tests were completed across repositories like [infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra) and [docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs) to validate the implementation from end to end.

**Investigating a Critical Blocker: The Cannon/Go Compatibility Issue**
A critical issue where a bug in the Go programming language (version 1.25) causes our fault-proof system (Cannon) to calculate incorrect hashes is being tracked across nine repositories. Teams from [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs), [infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra), and [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) collaborated to diagnose the problem and confirm its root cause lies in an upstream dependency. This coordinated investigation is crucial for tracking the external fix and mitigating its impact on our roadmap.
