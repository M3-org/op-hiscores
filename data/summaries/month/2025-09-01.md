# Overall Project Monthly Summary (September 2025)

## Executive Summary
September was a period of significant preparation and consolidation, focused on laying the groundwork for the next generation of protocol security while simultaneously enhancing the stability and performance of the current system. Foundational planning for the `Kona + Cannon` fault-proof system progressed across the stack, representing a major step toward greater decentralization. This future-focused work was balanced with immediate improvements to testing infrastructure, developer tooling, and the expansion of the Superchain ecosystem.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Laying the Groundwork for Next-Generation Fault Proofs**
*Strategic Importance: To enhance the security, decentralization, and interoperability of the OP Stack, we are designing and planning the integration of a new, more advanced fault-proof system.*
-   Extensive design discussions took place to prepare for the `Kona + Cannon` fault-proof system, defining the necessary changes to core contracts, monitoring tools, and client software ([design-docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs), [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry), [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth)).
-   Initial design work began on an "aggregate dispute game," exploring future multi-proof systems to further bolster network security ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
-   The `SystemConfig` contract was updated to support feature flagging, allowing new capabilities to be enabled more safely and flexibly across the network ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).

**Enhancing System Stability and Developer Velocity**
*Strategic Importance: Improving our internal tooling and test infrastructure allows us to build and ship higher-quality software faster, benefiting the entire ecosystem.*
-   A major overhaul of the testing framework was completed, unifying acceptance tests and migrating them to a modern environment to improve reliability and efficiency ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
-   CI regression tests were made 40% faster through performance optimizations, significantly speeding up the development cycle ([superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops)).
-   The core client, `op-geth`, was synchronized with the latest upstream `go-ethereum v1.16.2`, ensuring it benefits from the newest features and security fixes from the broader Ethereum community ([op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth)).
-   A significant number of long-standing initiatives related to the Cannon proof system and the Drippie automation service were finalized and closed, clearing the way for new development priorities ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).

**Growing the Superchain Ecosystem**
*Strategic Importance: A thriving Superchain depends on strong ecosystem participation, robust tooling, and a welcoming experience for new projects and users.*
-   The Superchain Token List was expanded to include official support for ARCv2, MITY, CIOTX, and FORT, enhancing interoperability and utility for users on Base and other Superchain networks ([ethereum-optimism.github.io](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io)).
-   A major initiative began to modernize the Optimism marketing site with a new tech stack (Next.js and Sanity) to improve performance and content management capabilities ([ecosystem](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem)).
-   Preparations began for network upgrades on Zora, Metal, and Mode Sepolia testnets, keeping ecosystem chains aligned with the latest protocol enhancements ([superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops)).
-   Chain analysis tooling was expanded to provide deeper insights into the health and configuration of more ecosystem chains, including gas limit data and analytical plots ([op-analytics](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics)).

**Advancing Governance and Public Goods Funding**
*Strategic Importance: We are committed to building sustainable mechanisms for funding public goods and fostering decentralized decision-making within the Optimism Collective.*
-   Foundational work was completed to prepare for Season 8 of Retroactive Public Goods Funding, creating a more generic and reusable framework to streamline future funding rounds ([Retro-Funding](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding)).
-   A critical bug in the Season 7 results data was fixed, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of on-chain records for public goods funding ([Retro-Funding](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**`Kona + Cannon` Fault-Proof Integration Planning**
A major cross-team effort this month involved planning the integration of the next-generation `Kona + Cannon` fault-proof system. This foundational security upgrade requires a coordinated effort across the entire stack. Discussions in `design-docs` laid out the high-level architecture, while specific implementation requirements were detailed for core contracts in `optimism` and `superchain-registry`, monitoring services like `op-dispute-mon` in `infra` and `ecosystem`, and client software in `op-geth`. This coordinated planning ensures all components will be ready for this critical step towards greater protocol decentralization.

**Addressing Core Protocol Bugs**
A critical bug in the P2P gossip configuration ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17308)) was identified and discussed across numerous repositories, including `optimism`, `infra`, `op-geth`, and `superchain-ops`. This collaborative triage process brought together expertise from different parts of the stack to diagnose the node stability issue and debate the most robust long-term solution, highlighting a shared commitment to network health.
