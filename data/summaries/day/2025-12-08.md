This daily summary highlights significant progress on the Jovian hard fork finalization across `op-geth` and `optimism` repositories, alongside continuous improvements to CI/CD and deployment tooling. A key cross-cutting discussion is the simplification of the batcher by removing the `isPectra` flag, with a contributor stepping up to implement the changes. Documentation was also updated to reflect current dRPC information.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - The discussion on removing `isPectra` from the batcher ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18479)) is active across multiple repositories (`ethereum-optimism/docs`, `ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io`, `ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry`, `ethereum-optimism/op-geth`, `ethereum-optimism/optimism`). `Himess` has expressed interest in taking on the task, and `geoknee` has confirmed they can proceed, indicating a need for coordination and support for this simplification effort.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Protocol & Hard Fork Finalization
- **Jovian Hard Fork Finalization**: Feature toggles related to the Jovian hard fork were removed in `op-geth` ([#703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/703)) and `optimism` ([#17978](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17978)), streamlining the codebase now that the features are integrated.
- **Enhanced Precompile Input Limit Testing**: New tests and comments were added to validate updated precompile input size limits in `op-geth` ([#731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/731)), ensuring robustness.
- **OPCMv2 Enhancements**: The OPCMv2 in `optimism` now supports upgrade-specific allowances for extra instructions, improving flexibility and security ([#18462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18462)).

### CI/CD and Deployment Tooling Improvements
- **`op-deployer` Fixes**: Error handling in `op-deployer`'s `add_game_type` CLI parsing was improved ([#18532](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18532)).
- **CI Workflow Enhancements**: Critical `attach-workspace` additions were made to the `docker-build` workflow ([#18543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18543), [#18545](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18545), [#18544](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18544)).
- **Slack Notification Fixes**: Fixes were implemented for empty Slack notifications in acceptance tests ([#18542](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18542)).
- **`op-deployer` Backports**: Backports for `op-deployer` v4 and v5 pipeline changes were completed ([#18539](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18539), [#18538](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18538)).
- **Superchain Config Address Fix**: A fix was applied for a superchain config address in tests ([#18537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18537)).

### Documentation & Registry Updates
- **dRPC Documentation Update**: The product name and link for dRPC were updated in the RPC providers reference documentation in `ethereum-optimism/docs` ([#1908](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1908)).
- **Superchain Registry Prestate Updates**: Finalized op-program 1.8.0 release and 1.9.0-rc.1 prestates were added to `standard-prestates.toml` in `ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry` ([#1176](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1176)).
