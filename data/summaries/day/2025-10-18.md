On Oct 18, 2025, Optimism's development focused on enhancing Safe module security within the `optimism` repository and preparing the Soneium Testnet for permissionless game types in `superchain-ops`. Key security updates were implemented to manage Safe modules during ownership transfers, while several new pull requests were opened across both repositories to introduce new features, improve testing, and address RPC throttling.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Safe Module Security Enhancements
- Enhanced the security of Safe modules by disabling the LivenessModule2 guard and module upon ownership transfer, ensuring proper management when a fallback owner takes control. ([#17808](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17808))
