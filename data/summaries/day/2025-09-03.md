Optimism Daily Project Summary (Sep 3, 2025)

Today, the project saw significant progress in core protocol enhancements with the addition of feature flagging to SystemConfig and improvements to testing infrastructure, including external EL sync tester integration. Critical bug fixes were implemented for Retro-Funding metrics and Go version compatibility in Superchain operations, while discussions continued across multiple repositories on improving CI/CD, integrating Kona and Cannon, and resolving a P2P gossip configuration bug.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - **P2P Gossip Configuration Bug**: Discussion on [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17308) needs input to decide between making invalid configs work or introducing a `DefaultP2PConfig` method for sensible defaults.
    - **Go 1.25 Compatibility for Cannon**: Issue [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17060) notes Go 1.25.1 release but questions if it includes the MIPS fix, requiring verification.
    - **Script for Permissionless Devnet Spinup**: Issue [#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/346) has a comment asking if it can be closed, indicating a need for confirmation on its status.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Protocol & System Enhancements
- **Feature Flagging in SystemConfig**: Added functionality to `SystemConfig` for feature flagging, allowing features to be toggled by the ProxyAdmin or its owner, enhancing control for future upgrades ([#17281](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17281)).
- **op-node Cache Size Comment Fix**: Corrected a comment in `op-node` regarding `l1.cache-size` to accurately reflect the `defaultCacheSize` as 3/2 of the sequencing window ([#17107](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17107)).
- **Min-Base-Fee `uint64` Addition**: Added an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3` as per protocol specifications ([#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/650)).

### Testing & CI/CD Improvements
- **External EL Sync Tester Integration**: Integrated a sync-tester with an external Execution Layer (EL) to improve testing capabilities, specifically provisioning the L2 genesis config to match the external network's configuration ([#17251](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17251)).
- **CI Job Relocation**: Migrated the `publish-cannon-prestates` CI job from Latitude to CircleCI boxes to address network flakiness and improve resource utilization ([#17296](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17296)).
- **Devnet Testing and Setup Refinement**: The issue concerning getting all tests running and passing in persistent devnets has been closed, indicating significant progress in this area ([#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/398)).

### Bug Fixes & Compatibility
- **Retro-Funding Metrics Correction**: Fixed a bug where Enso monthly summary metrics were missing from the `onchain__results.json` file for S7/M6, ensuring accurate data reporting ([#75](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/75)).
- **Go Version Compatibility**: Updated the Go version used by `mise` from `1.22.7` to `1.24.6` to ensure compatibility for `eip712sign`, which requires Go version `1.23.0` or higher ([#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1183)).

### Superchain Ecosystem Expansion
- **Superchain Token List Expansion**: Added ARCv2, MITY (Fission Bio), CIOTX, and FORT tokens to the Superchain Token List, enhancing ecosystem interoperability ([#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1184), [#1185](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1185), [#1191](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1191), [#1194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1194)).
- **Chain Analysis Output Updates**: Added new chain analysis output, including updated gas limit data for Ink, Mode, Soneium, Unichain, and Worldchain, along with new analytical plots and an updated README for the `jovian_analysis` notebook ([#1740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1740)).

### Proofs & Drippie Management

- **Interop Proofs Details for Governance**: Finalized details for interop proofs to be used in governance proposals ([#15968](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15968)).
- **Drippie Integration for Challenger Funds**: Implemented the use of Drippie to manage hot wallet funds for the challenger, improving funding management ([#12876](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12876)).
- **Drippie Mainnet Deployment**: Successfully deployed Drippie to Mainnet ([#13764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13764)).
- **Drippie Dashboards and Alerting**: Configured and integrated Drippie dashboards and alerting for better monitoring ([#14048](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14048)).

### Cannon and VM Runner Enhancements
- **Full `mips64r2` ISA Support in Cannon**: Added support for the full `mips64r2` Instruction Set Architecture in Cannon ([#13969](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13969)).
- **Cannon VM Runner Scaling**: Addressed the scaling of the Cannon VM Runner to cover more mainnet blocks ([#16910](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16910)).
