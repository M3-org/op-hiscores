Today, significant progress was made on enhancing the provability of output roots within the SuperFaultDisputeGame, alongside optimizing CI processes for `op-program` to reduce disk usage. A new pull request addresses deployment limits, and an issue concerning super root preimage provision was successfully closed.

## ✅ Completed Work
### SuperFaultDisputeGame Enhancements
- Updates were made to explicitly require proposers to provide the preimage of the super root when creating a game, ensuring all output roots in the super root are provable, impacting `op-e2e`, `op-proposer`, and `contracts-bedrock` components. ([#18605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18605))

### CI/CD Pipeline Fixes
- The `preimage-reproducibility` job in CI was optimized to reduce disk usage by deleting unused Docker artifacts during the build process. ([#18641](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18641))

## 🏗️ Work in Progress

- **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:
    - `op-deployer`: Ignore `max-code-size` limits ([#18642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18642))

## 🐞 Issue Triage
### New Issues
- **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:
    - Review correct trace output in `op-challenger` when next super root not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18643))

### Closed Issues
- **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:
    - Super root preimage provision when creating `SuperFaultDisputeGame`s ([#18521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18521))
