On December 10, 2025, the Optimism project focused heavily on critical bug fixes and stability improvements across the infrastructure, particularly addressing issues in `op-node` and `op-acceptor`, while also continuing discussions on a potential `op-node` sequencer recovery mode bug. Key developments included resolving flashblocks handler leaks, enhancing `op-acceptor`'s stability and performance, and refining system configuration specifications, alongside preparing for future Superchain integrations with new betanet tasks and production configurations.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism` - `op-node` Sequencer Recover Mode Bug ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18350)): Discussion continues on a potential bug where the sequencer in recovery mode requests a non-existent L1 origin block, leading to "not found" errors and potential derivation stalls; a relevant PR ([#18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)) and the influence of async L1 origin fetching ([#12134](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/12134)) are being investigated.
    - `ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry` - Investigating `op-node` Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18350)): Further investigation is needed into a potential bug in `op-node` sequencer recovery mode, with a relevant PR ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)) identified for review.
    - `ethereum-optimism/specs` - Sequencer Recovery Mode Behavior ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18350)): Input is needed to determine if PR ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)) is relevant to the `op-node` sequencer recovery mode issue where L1 origin blocks are not found.
    - `ethereum-optimism/infra` - Possible Bug in `op-node` Sequencer Recover Mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18350)): The team needs to investigate the potential influence of async L1 origin fetching and a proposed fix snippet to prevent temporary errors in `op-node`'s sequencer recover mode.
    - `ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops` - Possible Bug in op-node Sequencer Recover Mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18350)): The team should review the suggested relevant pull request ([#18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)) and consider the proposed fix snippet to prevent temporary errors in `op-node`'s sequencer recover mode.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Protocol Stability and Bug Fixes
- Resolved flashblocks handler leaks in `op-conductor` to enhance stability ([#18506](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18506)).
- Integrated missing Custom Gas Token (CGT) commits to ensure proper functionality across contract tests ([#18560](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18560)).
- Enforced compiler warnings and fixed test return values in `contracts-bedrock` ([#18567](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18567)).

### Infrastructure and Testing Enhancements
- Improved `op-acceptor` stability by fixing CLI telemetry setup and resolving memory leaks during subtest logging, enhancing test reliability and preventing OOM errors ([#528](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/528), [#526](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/526)).
- Updated `op-acceptor` to v3.8.1 ([#18563](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18563)).
- Added new tests to `op-node` to cover future/unknown `SystemConfig` events, improving forward compatibility ([#18566](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18566)).
- Updated `op-acceptance-tests` to include a pending nonce busy wait for the batcher, addressing flakiness in `TestBatcherFullChannelsAfterDowntime` ([#18564](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18564)).

### Registry and Configuration Updates
- Performed an automated codegen update to `chainList.json` and `chainList.toml`, keeping the superchain registry up-to-date ([#1178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1178)).
- Refined system configuration specifications to explicitly define malformed updates as "skipped," clarifying protocol behavior ([#868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/868)).
- Corrected `goreleaser` configurations across multiple services to ensure accurate display of latest releases ([#527](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/527)).
- Updated CODEOWNERS for `op-txproxy` to reflect the correct team ([#529](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/529)).
