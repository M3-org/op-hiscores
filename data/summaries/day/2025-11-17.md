On Nov 17, 2025, Optimism's development focused heavily on maintenance and cleanup across multiple repositories, with significant progress in closing aged issues, resolving flaky tests, and refining documentation. A key development was the introduction of new templates for vault upgrades and revenue sharing in `superchain-ops`, alongside enhanced testing infrastructure for Cannon and contract builds in `optimism`. The team also addressed documentation accuracy for `op-geth` upgrade procedures and removed the `snax` chain from the `superchain-registry`.

## 🚨 Needs Attention

*   **Urgent Discussions**:
    *   `ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops`: Discussions continue on the `min-base-fee` feature, with queries raised regarding the relevance of conducting simulations to prove its effectiveness ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16958)) and the need for a runbook for low batcher throughput scenarios ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16959)). `mslipper` questioned the current relevance of these tasks.
    *   `ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops`: The issue of adding `op-reth` back to the Jovian `kt-devnet` is being re-evaluated, with `mslipper` questioning its relevance given the deprecation of Kurtosis devnet and `geoknee` suggesting integration into `devstack / sysgo` instead ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17475)).
    *   `ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry`: `mslipper` questioned the current relevance of conducting simulations for `min-base-fee` effectiveness ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16958)) and creating a runbook for low batcher throughput with `min-base-fee` ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16959)).
    *   `ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry`: `mslipper` asked about the relevance of adding `op-reth` back to Jovian KT-devnet, with `geoknee` suggesting integration into `devstack / sysgo` instead due to Kurtosis devnet deprecation ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17475)).
    *   `ethereum-optimism/optimism`: `mslipper` inquired about the current relevance of `MinBaseFee` simulations ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16958)) and runbook creation ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16959)) to `geoknee`.
    *   `ethereum-optimism/optimism`: `mslipper` asked `geoknee` and `theochap` about the relevance of integrating `op-reth` back into Jovian `kt-devnet` in `op-acceptance-test`, given `kurtosis devnet`'s deprecation ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17475)).
    *   `ethereum-optimism/infra`: `mslipper` questioned the current relevance of `min-base-fee` simulations ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16958)) and runbook creation ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16959)) to `geoknee`.
    *   `ethereum-optimism/infra`: `mslipper` inquired about the relevance of adding `op-reth` back to the Jovian `kt-devnet` to `geoknee` and `theochap`, following `geoknee`'s suggestion to integrate into `devstack` / `sysgo` instead ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17475)).

## ✅ Completed Work

### Superchain Ecosystem Development
*   New templates were introduced in `superchain-ops` to facilitate vault upgrades and enable revenue sharing for chains, offering flexible paths for integration ([#1257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1257)).
*   The `snax` chain was removed from the `superchain-registry`, involving updates across various configuration files ([#1157](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1157)).

### Testing Infrastructure & CI Efficiency

*   Comprehensive Go 1.25 tests for Cannon were introduced in `optimism` ([#18279](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18279)).
*   A test for version validation in the WETH contract was added in `optimism` ([#18303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18303)).
*   The issue of Cannon supporting Go 1.25 was closed in `optimism` following the addition of unit tests ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17060)).
*   A series of acceptance tests for the base layer were closed in `infra`, indicating completion or deprecation ([#333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/333), [#334](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/334), [#335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/335), [#329](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/329), [#330](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/330), [#331](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/331), [#332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/332), [#345](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/345)).

### Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements
*   `optimism` enforced compiler warnings and corrected test return value checks in contracts ([#18264](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18264)).
*   A flakiness issue in `TestMissingBatchE2E` was addressed in `optimism` by retrying inclusion checks during EL indexing ([#18304](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18304)).
*   The `SuperchainConfigImpl` address was updated in `op-deployer`'s init test in `optimism` ([#18309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18309)).
*   `op-service` logging in `optimism` now includes `logfmtms` for improved log format usage ([#18297](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18297)).

### Documentation & Specification Refinements
*   An incorrect `op-geth` tag name was corrected in the `upgrade-17.mdx` file in `docs`, ensuring accurate upgrade documentation ([#1877](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1877)).
*   Several issues related to RPC specifications were closed in `specs`, indicating a push towards standardizing and clarifying RPC interactions ([#713](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/713), [#582](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/582)).
*   Issues concerning outdated interop specifications and the inclusion of unreleased predeploys were closed in `specs`, ensuring accuracy and relevance of interoperability documentation ([#628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/628), [#633](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/633)).
