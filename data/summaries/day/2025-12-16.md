On Dec 16, 2025, Optimism focused on enhancing the OP Stack's upgrade mechanisms with ordered upgrades in OPCMv2, alongside critical discussions on node synchronization, ZK Proof optimization, and interop transaction handling. Documentation efforts streamlined navigation and expanded faucet information, while op-geth saw new PRs for refactoring and bug fixes.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - **Node Synchronization Issues**: Input is needed on troubleshooting "missing trie node" errors and advice on OP-GETH snapshots or switching to Reth ([ethereum-optimism/op-geth#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581), [ethereum-optimism/docs#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581)).
    - **Interop Transaction Evaluation and Rework**: Architectural refactoring and Interop specification updates are needed to simplify the protocol by eliminating additional deposit transactions for proofs ([ethereum-optimism/op-geth#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18574), [ethereum-optimism/docs#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574)).
    - **Kona-SP1 Optimization for ZK Proofs**: Further identification of all code areas where keccak and sha2 operations occur outside the EVM, and if other computationally expensive operations require similar offloading, is needed ([ethereum-optimism/op-geth#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18533), [ethereum-optimism/docs#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18533), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18533)).

## ✅ Completed Work
### Protocol Upgrade Safety & Documentation
- **Enhanced Protocol Upgrade Safety**: A new feature was added to OPCMv2 to enforce proper ordering for chain upgrades, ensuring a more secure and predictable upgrade path for the Superchain ecosystem. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18583](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18583))
- **Documentation Structure and Navigation Refinements**: The `faucets` page was relocated, and unused files and links were cleaned up to ensure a more logical and user-friendly navigation experience. ([ethereum-optimism/docs#1921](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1921))
- **Faucet Information Expansion**: The addition of ethfaucet.com provides developers with an additional resource for obtaining testnet ETH across various Superchain networks, directly supporting the developer experience. ([ethereum-optimism/docs#1917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1917))
- **Content Integration and Organization**: A previously missing document was integrated into the Superchain information section, and a page was reorganized to improve its accessibility and relevance within developer guides. ([ethereum-optimism/docs#1923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1923), [ethereum-optimism/docs#1924](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1924))
