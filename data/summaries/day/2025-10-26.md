On Oct 26, 2025, Optimism development focused on critical stability improvements, including a bug fix in `op-deployer` to ensure reliable end-to-end deployment upgrade tests and significant documentation refinements. Concurrently, extensive preparations are underway for the U17 upgrade across multiple Superchain networks, with numerous related pull requests opened.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Deployment Test Stability
- A bug was fixed in the `op-deployer` package that affected the `runEndToEndBootstrapAndApplyUpgradeTest` helper function, ensuring the reliability of end-to-end deployment upgrade tests by correctly using the deployed Sepolia fork. ([#18023](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18023))

### Documentation Improvements
- Removed a duplicated `L1_BEACON_URL` from the `create-l2-rollup-example/.example.env` file, enhancing documentation accuracy. ([#1806](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1806))
- Added missing redirects to improve user navigation and content discoverability across various documentation files, including `create-l2-rollup-example/docker-compose.yml` and `pages/notices/upgrade-16a.mdx`. ([#1805](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1805))
