On August 1, 2025, significant progress was made on the "Min Base Fee" feature across multiple repositories, with new drafts shared for early review and discussions continuing on state growth estimation. Additionally, internal tooling updates and efforts to prevent mempool synchronization issues were addressed in the `optimism` repository.
