Today, significant progress was made across the Optimism ecosystem, particularly in preparing for the Jovian hard fork with receipt field population in `op-geth` and updated Superchain configurations. Infrastructure improvements included a new block range limiting feature in `proxyd` and the resolution of a persistent Flashblocks websocket timeout issue, while extensive documentation cleanup and internal link fixes were also completed across multiple repositories. A key ongoing discussion revolves around fixing the `op-batcher`'s max frame size for alternative DA solutions, with a proposed Celestia fix under review.

## ✅ Completed Work

### Core Protocol & Infrastructure Enhancements
- **`proxyd` Service Enhancements**: A new feature was added to `proxyd` to allow configuration of a maximum block range for RPC requests like `eth_getLogs`, improving performance and preventing abuse. ([ethereum-optimism/infra#494](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/494))
- **Jovian Fork Preparation and Receipt Field Population**: `op-geth` was updated to populate Jovian receipt fields (`daFootprintGasScalar` and `blobGasUsed`) during receipt derivation, preparing for the Jovian fork. ([ethereum-optimism/op-geth#710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/710))
- **Jovian DA Footprint Integration**: The Jovian protocol specification was updated to include new `daFootprintGasScalar` receipt fields and to set `blobGasUsed` to the transaction's DA footprint, aligning with `op-geth` implementations. ([ethereum-optimism/specs#839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/839))
- **Superchain Configuration Updates**: The `superchain-registry` reference in `op-geth` was updated to incorporate new Jovian timestamps. ([ethereum-optimism/op-geth#712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/712))
- **Registry Data Updates**: A typo was fixed in the standard versions configuration files for mainnet and Sepolia, and prestates for new `op-program` release candidates were added to `standard-prestates.toml`. ([ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry#1132](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1132), [ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry#1133](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1133))
- **Jovian Hard Fork Preparations & Dependency Updates**: `optimism` updated its `op-geth` dependency to reflect Jovian timestamps and receipt changes, and adjusted accelerated precompile input limits for Jovian in `op-program`. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18048](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18048), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18046](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18046), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18042))

([ethereum-optimism/optimism#17953](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17953), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#17944](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17944), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18001), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18057](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18057))
- **Transaction Pool Gossip Restriction Proof-of-Concept**: A proof-of-concept for `RollupNetrestrictTxPoolGossipFlag` was added to `op-geth` to restrict transaction pool gossip. ([ethereum-optimism/op-geth#713](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/713))
- **Infrastructure and Tooling Improvements**: `optimism` fixed a test due to a Geth breakage, aligned the fake beacon mock with post-Fulu L1 CL behavior, and gave more time for L2 to include bridge transactions in `op-devstack`. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#17757](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17757), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#17881](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17881), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#17772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17772), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#17771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17771), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18062](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18062))

- **Landing Page and Asset Management**: The landing page was moved in `docs`, alongside updates to associated assets, indicating a reorganization of public-facing assets. ([ethereum-optimism/docs#1813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1813))
- **Internal Link Maintenance and Testing**: Internal links within `docs` were updated to fix broken references, specifically in the `create-l2-rollup` tutorial, and testing confirmed Netlify removal. ([ethereum-optimism/docs#1811](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1811), [ethereum-optimism/docs#1814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1814))

### Data & Analytics Improvements
- **Pipeline Maintenance and Data Generation**: `op-analytics` implemented critical pipeline fixes and added new queries for the website dashboard, including a general table generation query and a specific query for Q3 2025 data. ([ethereum-optimism/op-analytics#1759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1759), [ethereum-optimism/op-analytics#1760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1760), [ethereum-optimism/op-analytics#1744](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1744))
