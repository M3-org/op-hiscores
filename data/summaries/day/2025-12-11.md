On Dec 11, 2025, the Optimism project significantly expanded Superchain support by adding Celo Sepolia and enhancing game type logic to include KONA for permissionless chain identification. A critical, widespread issue emerged regarding node synchronization failures across multiple Optimism-based chains, with users reporting "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors, prompting urgent requests for detailed client configurations and logs. Concurrently, core contracts were enhanced to support custom gas tokens and the `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrade, while initial steps were taken for the `op-interop-filter` service.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussion**: The "Node Synchronization Problems" issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18581), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18581), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18581), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581)) is critical, with maintainers requesting detailed client configurations, full logs for Op-Node and L1 Execution Client, and startup flags for all three clients to diagnose widespread synchronization failures.
- **Urgent Discussion**: The "Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx" issue ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574)) requires further input on the necessity and implications of additional transactions for proofs when a replacement block is inserted due to an invalid interop transaction.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Superchain Ecosystem Expansion & Configuration
- Added Celo Sepolia to the Superchain registry, including its configuration files and updated chain lists, expanding the Superchain ecosystem. ([#1116](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1116))
- Updated `codegen.go` logic to recognize KONA (game type 8) alongside CANNON (game type 1) as valid game types for marking chains as permissionless in `chainList.json`. ([#1179](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1179))
- Introduced and executed tasks to add a permissionless game type (0) and set it as the respected game type for the Soneium Minato Testnet. ([#1317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1317), [#1320](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1320))

### Core Contracts & Deployment Enhancements
- Added a new feature to `OPContractsManagerV2` to support custom gas tokens, allowing for more flexible gas management. ([#18455](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18455))
