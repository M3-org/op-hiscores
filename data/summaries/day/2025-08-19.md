Aug 19, 2025 Daily Project Summary

Today's project activity focused on initiating new features, with a significant pull request opened to support custom gas tokens in `specs` and a redesign proposed for the `docs` homepage. A recurring theme across multiple repositories was the ongoing investigation and discussion around missing test logs in `op-acceptance-tests`, with clarifications provided and potential resolutions identified. Minor code cleanup was also performed in `op-analytics`, and new issues were opened in `optimism` to improve `op-up` user experience and review public documentation.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [ethereum-optimism/optimism#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17151): Discussion is ongoing regarding missing test logs in `op-acceptance-tests`, with clarification provided that the "go-tests-short" workflow is not designed for comprehensive acceptance tests and that logs are not captured via `op-acceptor`. Further input may be needed to fully resolve this.
