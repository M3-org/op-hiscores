Nov 11, 2025 - Overall Project Summary

Today, the Optimism project saw significant activity across several key areas, including enhancements to testing infrastructure with new Jovian tests and CI stability improvements in the `optimism` repository, alongside critical documentation updates for node troubleshooting and DA footprint configuration. Additionally, efforts were made to resolve `mise install` errors in the `infra` repository and initiate a `superchainConfig` upgrade for the Soneium devnet.

## ✅ Completed Work

### Testing and CI Infrastructure Enhancements
- New Jovian tests were implemented to run against Pectra and BPO2, expanding test coverage for different L1 configurations ([#18005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18005)).
- A bug in acceptance tests was fixed to guard against empty tests, preventing CI failures ([#18238](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18238)).
- The issue of running Jovian tests against various L1s, specifically Pectra and Fusaka, was resolved, allowing for generic test implementations to be imported into subpackages with different devnet configurations ([#17980](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17980)).

### Documentation and Developer Tooling Improvements
- A bug related to the invisibility of unclean shutdowns in node troubleshooting documentation was fixed, enhancing clarity for node operators ([#1854](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1854)).
- The contract test maintenance prompt was refactored to remove unnecessary test reordering, simplifying PR reviews ([#18248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18248)).
- A general-purpose GitHub release binary downloader was developed for internal use, improving efficiency for fetching tools like `forge` ([#18245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18245)).
- An issue in `op-devstack` was addressed to gracefully handle malformed multiaddr errors by retrying peer info fetching ([#18240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18240)).

### Infrastructure Bug Fixes
- A fix was implemented to resolve an issue where `mise install` was failing due to a missing `asterisc` complaint, by adopting a pattern from the Optimism monorepo ([#507](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/507)).
