On November 11, 2025, Optimism's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, particularly for Jovian tests against Pectra and BPO2, alongside critical bug fixes in acceptance tests and refactoring of AI engineering prompts. Significant progress was also made in improving node operator documentation and addressing `mise` installation issues within the infrastructure. A new `superchainConfig` upgrade for the Soneium devnet was initiated.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Enhanced Testing & Stability
*   **Expanded Test Coverage**: Jovian tests are now configured to run against Pectra and BPO2, broadening test coverage for different L1 configurations in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#18005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18005)).
*   **CI Pipeline Reliability**: A bug fix was implemented to guard against empty tests in CI, preventing pipeline failures ([#18238](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18238)).
*   **Core System Stability**: Improvements were made to the `op-node` to debounce FCU updates, enhancing system stability ([#18234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18234)).
*   **P2P Connection Reliability**: `op-devstack` now includes error handling for malformed multiaddr responses, improving P2P connection reliability ([#18240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18240)).

### Documentation & Developer Tooling
*   **Node Operator Documentation Clarity**: A bug fix was implemented to address an issue where an unclean shutdown was not visible in the node troubleshooting guide, enhancing clarity for node operators ([#1854](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1854)).
*   **Reusable Binary Downloader**: A general-purpose GitHub release binary downloader was introduced in `op-service`, providing a reusable tool for downloading dependencies like `forge` ([#18245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18245)).

### Infrastructure & AI Engineering
*   **`mise` Installation Fix**: A fix was implemented to resolve an issue where `mise install` was failing due to a missing 'asterisc' component, by adopting a pattern from the Optimism monorepo ([#507](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/507)).
*   **AI Engineering Prompt Refinement**: The AI engineering prompt for contract test maintenance was refactored to remove unnecessary test reordering instructions, reducing diff sizes and improving PR reviewability ([#18248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18248)).
*   **`mise` Debugging Improvements**: Verbose logging was added to the `mise` installation process in CircleCI to aid in debugging a persistent error ([#506](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/506)).
