Optimism's development today centered on enhancing the `op-dispute-mon`'s robustness in handling out-of-sync nodes and refining output root discrepancy detection. Discussions are ongoing regarding the most reliable method for `op-dispute-mon` to determine node synchronization, with a focus on L1 block processing rather than just L2 block height. A minor documentation fix for the quick start tutorial was also initiated.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [ethereum-optimism/docs#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17814) and [ethereum-optimism/optimism#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814): Input is needed on the best approach for `op-dispute-mon` to handle out-of-sync nodes, specifically on using `CurrentL1` from sync status to determine if a node has processed the relevant L1 block for a dispute game.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Dispute Monitor Enhancements
- The `op-dispute-mon` was updated to distinguish between a transport-level 404 error and an actual "output root not found" condition, improving accuracy for multi-node support. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#17819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17819))
