On August 11, 2025, the Optimism project saw significant planning for future work, particularly around Data Availability (DA) footprint limits and multi-proof systems, with several new issues opened to track these efforts. A key ongoing discussion across multiple repositories involved refining the `min-base-fee` specification, leading to a decision to move state growth estimations to a separate design document. This indicates a strategic effort to scope technical specifications more precisely while advancing foundational infrastructure and future system enhancements.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `min-base-fee` specification refinement in [ethereum-optimism/specs#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/742) and [ethereum-optimism/optimism#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/742) requires continued input, as the discussion on state growth estimation has been moved to a separate design document ([ethereum-optimism/design-docs#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/316)).

## üèóÔ∏è Work in Progress
- **Active Discussions**:
    - **Min-Base-Fee Specification**: Discussion continued across [ethereum-optimism/specs#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/742), [ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/742), and [ethereum-optimism/optimism#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/742) regarding the `min-base-fee` specification, with a decision to move state growth estimation to a separate design document ([ethereum-optimism/design-docs#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/316)).
