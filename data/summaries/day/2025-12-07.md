On Dec 7, 2025, the project focused on refining documentation with critical redirect fixes and clarifying devnet warnings, while also initiating work on optimizing `kona-sp1` cryptographic operations and improving error handling in `op-deployer`.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/1898): Discussion on `op-node` warnings in devnet deployments has clarified they are not problematic for local devnets, but further input on broader implications might be beneficial.
    - [ethereum-optimism/docs#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1898): Similar discussion regarding devnet warnings, confirming they are not an issue for local devnets.
    - [ethereum-optimism/optimism#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1898): Further clarification on `op-node` warnings during devnet deployment, confirming they are benign for local setups.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Documentation & Changelog Maintenance
- Updated the changelog in `Retro-Funding` to ensure accurate project history ([ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding#90](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/90)).
- Implemented a significant bug fix to correct redirects across various documentation sections in `docs`, improving user navigation ([ethereum-optimism/docs#1907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1907)).
