On Dec 7, 2025, the project saw significant documentation improvements with numerous redirect fixes across various sections, enhancing user navigation. Development also focused on minor bug fixes in `op-deployer` and identifying optimization opportunities for `kona-sp1`, while clarifying that certain `op-node` warnings in devnet deployments are non-problematic.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [ethereum-optimism/docs#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1898): Discussion on devnet deployment warnings needs input to confirm the non-problematic nature for local devnets.
    - [ethereum-optimism/optimism#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1898): Further input on `op-node` devnet warnings to ensure full understanding across teams.
    - [ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/1898): Clarification on `op-node` warnings in devnet deployments to ensure all stakeholders are aware they are not problematic for local development.

## ✅ Completed Work
