On December 21, 2025, core development focused on enhancing the `op-supernode`'s `superroot_atTimestamp` response format and integrating a new supernode super root provider into `op-challenger` to improve dependency handling. An important new issue was opened concerning the consistency of `superroot_atTimestamp` responses, while discussions continued on persistent node synchronization problems related to "missing trie node" errors.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism` [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581): Ongoing discussions around "missing trie node" errors in `op-geth` require input on recommended `geth` versions and snapshots to resolve node synchronization problems.

## ✅ Completed Work
- **Supernode & Challenger Interoperability**:
    - Implemented a new supernode super root provider in `op-challenger` with passing unit tests, addressing chain ID handling at requested timestamps. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18653))
    - Refined the `op-supernode`'s `superroot_atTimestamp` response format by stopping the conversion of all errors to "not found" and switching to `ethereum.NotFound` for clearer error flagging. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18652](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18652))

## 🏗️ Work in Progress
- **New Pull Requests**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism`:
        - [#18666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18666): `op-node` should return an error instead of panicking when L1 chain ID is nil.

## 🐞 Issue Triage
- **New Issues**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism`:
        - [#18667](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18667): Ensure consistency of `superroot_atTimestamp` responses in `op-supernode` to address potential race conditions.
