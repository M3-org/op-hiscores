On December 2, 2025, Optimism saw significant progress in enhancing the `op-challenger` for ZK game types and integrating a Custom Gas Token system feature, alongside continued discussions on critical issues like `proxyd`'s "backwards time travel" and `op-node` invalid block signatures. Documentation was also restructured, and a new feature for Worldchain Sepolia key handback tasks was added, indicating ongoing expansion and maintenance of the Superchain ecosystem.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussion**: `proxyd` Backwards Time Travel ([ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/501), [ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/501), [ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/501), [ethereum-optimism/docs#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/501), [ethereum-optimism/infra#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/501), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/501)): Discussion continues on how `proxyd` can return previous blocks if backends are out of sync, with a team member planning to focus on this from January 1st, but immediate input on the proposed solutions (multicall, error handling, sticky sessions) could accelerate resolution.
- **Urgent Discussion**: `op-node` Invalid Block Signature ([ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17448), [ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17448), [ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17448), [ethereum-optimism/infra#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17448), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17448)): Multiple users are reporting the same "op-node invalid block signature unrecognized signer" error during testnet deployment, indicating a need for a solution.

## ✅ Completed Work
### OP Stack Development & ZK Game Enhancements
- **Custom Gas Token Integration**: The `CUSTOM_GAS_TOKEN` dev feature flag was removed and replaced with a system feature flag, streamlining its usage across CI, deployer, and tests. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18405](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18405))
- **`op-challenger` ZK Game Support**: Initial progress was made to support challenging invalid ZK game types, refactoring `TraceType` to `GameType`, and introducing a generic `Player` implementation to reduce boilerplate for new game types. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18442](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18442), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18433), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18441](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18441))
- **Shared Client Providers**: Client providers were made a service-level concept, allowing sharing between fault and ZK game types. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18440))

### Superchain Ecosystem Expansion & Maintenance
- **Worldchain Sepolia Key Handback Tasks**: A new feature was added to include Worldchain Sepolia key handback over tasks, involving updates to environment files, READMEs, validation documents, and configuration files. ([ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops#1284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1284))
- **Automated Registry Update**: An automated code generation update was performed, modifying the `addresses.json` file within the `superchain/extra` directory as part of routine maintenance. ([ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry#1171](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1171))

### Developer Experience & Infrastructure Improvements
- **Documentation Restructuring**: A major effort was undertaken to combine various community-related documentation files, impacting governance, app-developer tools, and OP Stack protocol sections. ([ethereum-optimism/docs#1879](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1879))
- **Upgrade Notice Updates**: Versions for `rollup-boost` and `op-rbuilder` were updated within the upgrade 17 notice. ([ethereum-optimism/docs#1896](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1896))
- **Unified Websocket Client**: A unified websocket client was introduced and integrated into `op-devstack` and `op-conductor`, replacing bespoke wrappers and improving consistency. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18324](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18324))
- **CI Workflow Fix**: The factory workflow in CI was updated to use the `attest` parameter, fixing attestation failures on fork PRs. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18471](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18471))
- **`op-dispute-mon` Update**: `op-dispute-mon` was updated to include `cannon-kona` and `optimistic-zk` in the list of game types using output roots. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18469))
