On December 2, 2025, Optimism saw significant progress in enhancing the Superchain ecosystem, particularly with new features for Custom Gas Tokens and robust improvements to `op-challenger` for ZK game types, alongside continued efforts in documentation and infrastructure maintenance. A key focus remains on addressing persistent `op-node` invalid block signature errors and `proxyd`'s "backwards time travel" issue, with plans for dedicated resolution in the new year.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io` [#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17448): Multiple users are reporting "op-node invalid block signature unrecognized signer" errors on testnet and are seeking solutions.

    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism` [#18470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18470): Sequencer blocks are being rejected by P2P due to "timestamp too old" errors when the chain is behind wall clock time, potentially impacting decentralization.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Protocol Enhancements
- **Custom Gas Token Integration**: The `CUSTOM_GAS_TOKEN` development feature flag was removed and replaced with a system feature flag, streamlining its usage across CI, deployer, and tests. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18405](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18405))
- **`op-challenger` ZK Game Support**: `op-challenger` now supports challenging invalid ZK game types, marking initial progress towards robust ZK game dispute resolution. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18442](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18442))
- **`op-challenger` Game Type Simplification**: The `TraceType` concept was removed in favor of `GameType`, simplifying game type definitions and improving clarity. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18433))
- **`op-challenger` Generic Player Implementation**: A generic `Player` implementation was introduced to handle sync status and prestate validation, reducing boilerplate for new game types. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18441](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18441))
- **`op-challenger` Client Provider Refactoring**: Client providers are now a service-level concept, allowing them to be shared between fault and ZK game types. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18440))

### Superchain Ecosystem Development
- **Worldchain Sepolia Key Handback Over Task**: A new feature was added to implement the Worldchain Sepolia key handback over task, including new environment files, READMEs, validation documents, and configuration files. ([ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops#1284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1284))
- **Automated Registry Update**: An automated code generation update was performed, modifying the `addresses.json` file within the `superchain/extra` directory as part of routine maintenance. ([ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry#1171](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1171))

### Documentation and Infrastructure Improvements
- **Documentation Consolidation**: Various community-related documentation files were combined to streamline information across governance, app-developer tools, chain operator references, and contribution guides. ([ethereum-optimism/docs#1879](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1879))
- **Upgrade Notice Updates**: Version numbers for `rollup-boost` and `op-rbuilder` were updated within the upgrade 17 notice to reflect the latest component versions. ([ethereum-optimism/docs#1896](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1896))
- **CI Workflow Update**: The factory workflow in CI was updated to use the `attest` parameter, fixing attestation failures on fork PRs. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18471](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18471))
- **Unified Websocket Client**: A single, unified transport websocket client was introduced and integrated into `op-devstack` and `op-conductor`, replacing bespoke wrappers and improving stability. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18324](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18324))
- **`op-dispute-mon` Update**: `op-dispute-mon` was updated to include `cannon-kona` and `optimistic-zk` in its list of output root game types, reflecting current game type usage. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18469))
- **Rollup-Boost Reversion Acceptance**: The acceptance criteria for `rollup-boost` reverting to default EL block building under specific conditions has been successfully met and the issue closed. ([ethereum-optimism/infra#315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/315))
