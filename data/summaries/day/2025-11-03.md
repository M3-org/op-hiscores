On November 3, 2025, Optimism's development focused heavily on refining core infrastructure and documentation, particularly around Superchain configurations and contract specifications. A significant cross-repository effort was made to close out the long-standing issue of reporting unused acceptance tests, as the team transitions to gateless mode testing. Discussions are ongoing regarding the documentation of the DA Footprint Limit, highlighting its importance for protocol security and spam prevention.
