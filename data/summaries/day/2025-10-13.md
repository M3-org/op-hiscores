Today, significant progress was made on `op-deployer` to support upgrades up to v4.1.0 and enhance acceptance test stability, alongside new documentation for oracles and an upstream version bump for `op-geth`. A recurring discussion across multiple repositories centered on the graceful monitoring and alerting of replica-healthchecks, with clarification that this is an infrastructure-level concern.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Blocked Issue Discussion**: Issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17686) (also in `docs`, `op-geth`, and `optimism`) regarding replica-healthcheck monitoring is blocked as it's an infrastructure-level implementation, not `op-conductor` scope; future contributions should be discussed with a maintainer and assigned.
- **New Issue for Investigation**: Issue [#17835](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17835) requires investigation into `op-conductor` flashblocks-streaming and raft timeout problems, specifically an error related to reading from the `rollup-boost` WebSocket.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### `op-deployer` Enhancements & Test Stability
- **`op-deployer` Upgrade Support**: The `op-deployer` tool was updated to support and test upgrades up to v4.1.0, including updating `superchain-registry/validation` package imports and porting existing upgrade support. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#17824](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17824))
- **Acceptance Test Stability**: Miscellaneous fixes were implemented for flake-shake, improving the reliability and accuracy of acceptance test reporting. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#17830](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17830))
- **New Acceptance Test Integration**: A new test, `TestL2ELP2PCanonicalChainAdvancedByFCU`, was integrated into the FlakeShake system for `op-acceptance-tests`. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#17833](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17833))

### `rollup-boost` Healthiness Tolerance
- **`rollup-boost` Partial Healthiness Tolerance**: Two issues related to implementing and deploying an opt-in tolerance for `op-rbuilder` failures in `op-conductor` were closed. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#17678](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17678), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#17680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17680))
