Today's development focused on enhancing the stability and features of the `optimism` repository, particularly within the `op-batcher` and `conductor` components, alongside minor dependency cleanup in `op-analytics`. Key activities included addressing potential race conditions and nil pointer dereferences in `op-batcher`, introducing new RPC commands and configuration options for `conductor`, and improving contract test coverage. A new issue was raised concerning `op-batcher` data availability when using `callData`.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - ethereum-optimism/optimism: A new question has been raised regarding potential problems when running `op-batcher` with `--data-availability-type=callData` and its implications for L1 beacon configuration in `op-node` and `op-challenger` ([#18698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18698)). Input is needed to clarify this configuration.

## ✅ Completed Work
- **Dependency Management**:
    - Removed the 'sugar' dependency from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` in `op-analytics` as it was unused and caused installation issues ([#1778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1778)).
