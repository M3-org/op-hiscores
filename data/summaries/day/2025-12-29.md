Today's development focused on enhancing the stability and features of the `optimism` repository, particularly for `op-batcher` and `conductor` components, alongside minor dependency cleanup in `op-analytics`. Key new pull requests address potential race conditions and nil pointer dereferences in `op-batcher`, introduce new RPC commands and configuration options for `conductor`, and improve contract test coverage. A new issue was raised concerning `op-batcher` data availability with `callData` for new chains.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `optimism`: A new question has been raised regarding potential problems when running `op-batcher` with `--data-availability-type=callData` for new chains, seeking clarification on whether this configuration introduces any issues. [#18698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18698)

## ✅ Completed Work
### Dependency Management
- `op-analytics`: The 'sugar' package was removed from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` as it was not actively used and caused installation problems in other projects. [#1778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1778)
