## Overall Project Summary (Dec 20, 2025)

Today's development focused on enhancing the security and resilience of the Optimism network with new pull requests addressing denial-of-service prevention and peer-to-peer network stability, alongside internal code cleanup in `op-geth`. A new issue was reported concerning an `eth_simulatev1` error post-Jovian fork, indicating a potential problem with deposit transaction handling.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [`ethereum-optimism/op-geth#739`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/739): An `eth_simulatev1` error is occurring after the Jovian fork, reporting "missing deposit transaction," which needs investigation.

## ✅ Completed Work
- **Codebase Refinement**:
    - Internal cleanup in `op-geth` by removing the `storedReceiptsRLP` struct to streamline core data accessors and types, superseding a previous pull request. [`ethereum-optimism/op-geth#738`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/738)

## 🏗️ Work in Progress
- **New Pull Requests**:
    - **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:
        - Add request body size limit to `op-up` to prevent Denial-of-Service attacks. [`ethereum-optimism/optimism#18665`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18665)
        - Improve static peer resilience in the p2p network by implementing individual exponential backoff monitors. [`ethereum-optimism/optimism#18664`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18664)

## 🐞 Issue Triage
- **New Issues**:
    - **ethereum-optimism/op-geth**:
        - `eth_simulatev1` error after Jovian fork: "error calculating DA footprint: missing deposit transaction". [`ethereum-optimism/op-geth#739`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/739)
