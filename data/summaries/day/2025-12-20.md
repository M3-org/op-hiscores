On Dec 20, 2025, Optimism focused on enhancing network security and resilience with new pull requests addressing denial-of-service prevention and peer-to-peer stability, alongside internal code cleanup in `op-geth`. A new issue was reported regarding an `eth_simulatev1` error post-Jovian fork, indicating a potential problem with transaction simulation.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `eth_simulatev1` error post-Jovian fork in `op-geth`: This new issue ([#739](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/739)) reports a potential problem with transaction simulation or data availability footprint calculation since the Jovian fork and requires investigation.

## ✅ Completed Work
- **Codebase Refinement**:
    - `op-geth`: Internal cleanup was performed by removing the `storedReceiptsRLP` struct, streamlining core data accessors and types ([#738](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/738)).

## 🏗️ Work in Progress
- **New Pull Requests**:
    - **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:
        - Added a request body size limit to `op-up` to prevent Denial-of-Service attacks ([#18665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18665)).
        - Improved static peer resilience in the p2p network by implementing individual exponential backoff monitors ([#18664](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18664)).

## 🐞 Issue Triage
- **New Issues**:
    - **ethereum-optimism/op-geth**:
        - `eth_simulatev1` is returning an error "error calculating DA footprint: missing deposit transaction" since the Jovian fork ([#739](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/739)).
