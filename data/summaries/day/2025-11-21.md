Overall Project Summary for Nov 21, 2025:

Today was marked by significant progress in contract verification, with the `op-deployer` now supporting Forge for enhanced transparency and security, alongside critical bug fixes for `op-node` stability. Documentation received substantial improvements, and preparations for the U17 Jovian upgrade for Base Mainnet are well underway.

## ✅ Completed Work

### Enhanced Contract Verification and Security
- **ethereum-optimism/optimism**: `op-deployer` now supports contract verification using Forge, streamlining the process and improving transparency ([#18096](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18096)).
- **ethereum-optimism/optimism**: General contract verification improvements, including support for Blockscout and integration of a common interface, were completed with Forge binary support ([#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14813)).

### Node Stability and CI Reliability Improvements
- **ethereum-optimism/optimism**: `op-node` now correctly handles "too old" batch epochs, preventing issues with span batch overlaps ([#18283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18283)).
- **ethereum-optimism/optimism**: CI jobs were fixed to prevent "Text file busy" errors by ensuring dependencies are installed before tests run, and `op-acceptance-tests` timeouts were reduced ([#18351](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18351), [#18349](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18349)).

### Documentation and Superchain Registry Enhancements
- **ethereum-optimism/docs**: Overall documentation structure was improved by moving OP Stack components and refining the chain operator section ([#1873](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1873), [#1881](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1881)).
- **ethereum-optimism/docs**: Deployment section bugs were fixed, and a new troubleshooting guide for `eth_sendRawTransaction` issues was added for node operators ([#1882](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1882), [#1875](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1875)).
- **ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry**: The staging report now includes `SystemConfig.minBaseFee` for `op-contracts/v5.0.0` and later, and `op-contracts/v5.0.0` entries were added to standard version files ([#1165](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1165), [#1166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1166)).
- **ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry**: Automated codegen updated `addresses.json`, and broken links in documentation were fixed ([#1167](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1167), [#1153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1153)).

### U17 Jovian Upgrade Preparation
- **ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops**: Configuration files and documentation were updated in preparation for the U17 Jovian upgrade for Base Mainnet, including `.env`, `README.md`, `VALIDATION.md`, and `config.toml` ([#1272](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1272)).

### Analytics Modifications
- **ethereum-optimism/op-analytics**: Modifications were made to Dune pulls, specifically impacting `other_chains_tracking/get_all_txs.ipynb` and `other_chains_tracking/get_qualified_txs.ipynb` ([#1767](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1767), [#1766](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1766)).
