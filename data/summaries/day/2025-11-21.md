This daily digest summarizes the development activities across Optimism's repositories for November 21, 2025. The primary focus today was on enhancing contract verification capabilities across the ecosystem, particularly through the integration of Forge, alongside significant documentation improvements and preparations for the U17 Base Mainnet upgrade. A potential `op-node` sequencer bug has been identified and is under investigation.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Enhanced Contract Verification and Developer Tooling
- The `op-deployer` tool now integrates Forge for contract verification, streamlining the process and improving transparency and security within the Optimism ecosystem. ([#18096](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18096))
- The issue concerning the conversion of contract verification logic to use Forge for the Forge Deployer was closed across multiple repositories, indicating successful implementation. ([#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17218), [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17218), [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17218), [#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14813), [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17218), [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17218), [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17218))

### Documentation and Superchain Registry Improvements
- Substantial restructuring and content updates were made to the documentation, including better organization of OP Stack components and a comprehensive reorganization of the chain operator section. ([#1873](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1873), [#1881](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1881))
- Bug fixes were implemented in the deployment section of the documentation, and the troubleshooting guide for node operators was enhanced. ([#1882](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1882), [#1875](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1875))
- The staging report in `superchain-registry` now includes the `SystemConfig.minBaseFee()` getter for `op-contracts/v5.0.0` and later, and documentation links were updated. ([#1165](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1165), [#1153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1153))
- Entries for `op-contracts/v5.0.0` were added to `standard-versions-*.toml` files, and an automated codegen update was merged. ([#1166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1166), [#1167](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1167))

### Core Protocol Stability and Upgrade Preparation
- Critical bug fixes were deployed to `op-node` to correctly handle "too old" batch epochs and stabilize CI jobs by fixing a "Text file busy" race condition and reducing timeouts. ([#18283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18283), [#18351](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18351), [#18349](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18349))
- Configuration files and test updates were made in `superchain-ops` in preparation for the U17 Base Mainnet upgrade. ([#1272](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1272))

### Analytics and Ecosystem Updates
- Modifications were made to Dune pulls in `op-analytics`, specifically impacting `other_chains_tracking/get_all_txs.ipynb` and `other_chains_tracking/get_qualified_txs.ipynb`. ([#1767](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1767), [#1766](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1766))
