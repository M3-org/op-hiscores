On Sep 4, 2025, Optimism significantly advanced its testing infrastructure by unifying all acceptance tests into a single workflow and adding new system-level tests, while also making progress on tool version management with the introduction of `mise` in the `infra` repository. A critical discussion continued regarding `op-node/p2p/gossip` configuration overwrites, and a long-standing `op-geth` initialization error was resolved.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**: Input is needed on the `op-node/p2p/gossip` configuration issue ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17308), [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17308)) to decide between enforcing valid defaults or making invalid configurations work, with a proposed solution of a `DefaultP2PConfig` method.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
- **Streamlined Acceptance Test Workflow**: All acceptance tests are now consolidated into a single workflow, improving efficiency and organization by stopping their execution as unit tests in other workflows. ([#16755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16755), [#16817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16817))
- **Acceptance Test Workflow Unification**: The long-standing goal of centralizing acceptance test execution was completed, moving them out of other workflows like 'go tests' in the 'main' workflow. ([#16272](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16272))

### Tooling and Infrastructure Improvements
- **Tool Version Management Enhancement**: The `infra` repository introduced `mise` to standardize and simplify tool version management, with `op-acceptor` leading initial adoption. ([#452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/452))

## üèóÔ∏è Work in Progress
### Active Discussions
- **P2P Gossip Configuration Overwrites**: Discussion continues on an issue where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites default values with zero values, leading to invalid configurations and panics in certain test environments. ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17308))
- **op-geth Initialization Error**: Users continue to report an "head block is not reachable" error during `op-geth` initialization, with some noting that `geth` remains at Block 0 even after proceeding. ([#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/420))

## üêû Issue Triage
### Closed Issues
- **`op-geth` Initialization Error Resolution**: An issue where `op-geth init` would give a "head block is not reachable" error was closed, with recent comments indicating it might not be critical and setup can proceed. ([#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/420))
