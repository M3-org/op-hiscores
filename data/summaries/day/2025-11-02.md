Overall Project Summary for Nov 2, 2025:

Today's focus was on enhancing system stability and monitoring, with significant work on dispute monitor error tracking and a critical bug fix for contract upgrades in `optimism`. Discussions also continued across multiple repositories regarding blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr`, exploring potential "quick win" solutions for transaction inclusion.

## 🚨 Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `superchain-registry`: Discussion on [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18102) regarding blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr` suggests a "decay" approach for starting priority fees to improve transaction inclusion during busy periods. Input is needed to evaluate this potential quick win.
    - `ethereum-optimism.github.io`: Discussion on [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102) echoes the "decay" approach for blob priority fees, requiring further team input.
    - `design-docs`: Discussion on [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102) also highlights the "decay" approach for blob priority fees, needing team evaluation.

## ✅ Completed Work
- **System Stability & Monitoring Enhancements**:
    - New Prometheus metrics were added to `op-dispute-mon` to track node endpoint errors, improving visibility into RPC failures during the update cycle. ([#17622](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17622))
    - A bug in the `opcm.upgrade` process was resolved, ensuring the `CANNON_KONA` initial bond is correctly set during contract upgrades. ([#18100](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18100))
