## Overall Project Summary for Nov 2, 2025

Today's focus across the Optimism ecosystem included significant enhancements to dispute monitoring with new error metrics and a critical bug fix in the `opcm.upgrade` process for `CANNON_KONA` initial bond. Discussions continued on optimizing blob priority fee tracking, with a proposed "quick win" to improve batcher efficiency during busy periods. Additionally, several new pull requests were opened, including an automated codegen update and additions of a new creator coin to Base.

## 🚨 Needs Attention

- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - **ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry**: Discussion on [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18102) regarding blob priority fee tracking needs input on a proposed "decay" mechanism for starting priority fees to improve batcher handling of backlogs.
    - **ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io**: Discussion on [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102) regarding blob priority fee tracking needs input on a proposed "decay" mechanism for starting priority fees to improve batcher handling of backlogs.
    - **ethereum-optimism/design-docs**: Discussion on [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102) regarding blob priority fee tracking needs input on a proposed "decay" mechanism for starting priority fees to improve batcher handling of backlogs.

## ✅ Completed Work

### Monitoring & Reliability Improvements
- **Dispute Monitor Enhancements**: New Prometheus metrics were added to `op-dispute-mon` to track node endpoint errors, improving visibility into RPC endpoint health during the update cycle. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#17622](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17622))

### Core Protocol Stability
- **Contract Management Bug Fix**: A bug in the `opcm.upgrade` process was resolved, ensuring the `CANNON_KONA` initial bond is correctly set during upgrades. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18100](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18100))
