On Oct 16, 2025, Optimism saw significant progress in core infrastructure with a consensus-breaking update to the operator fee formula and critical fixes in `op-geth` for header verification and operator fees. Concurrently, documentation restructuring efforts began, and the Superchain token list expanded with several new additions, while ongoing issues related to sequencer startup failures and operator fee math are being actively discussed across multiple repositories.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `op-conductor` sequencer startup failure: Issue [#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17899) in `ethereum-optimism/infra` needs assistance from @zhwrd to resolve a "no unsafe head" error.
    - Jovian Operator Fee Saturating Math: Issue [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17888) in `ethereum-optimism/infra` is discussing whether saturating math is necessary for the `operatorFee` getter.
    - Jovian Operator Fee Testing: Issue [#17897](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17897) in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` requests an explicit test for operator fee parameter changes post-Jovian fork.
    - Jovian SystemConfig Marshaling: Issue [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17907) in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` raises concern about marshaling new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` before Jovian is active, potentially breaking zk stacks.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Protocol & Infrastructure Enhancements
- **Operator Fee Formula Update**: A consensus-breaking feature was implemented to update the operator fee formula across `op-node`, `op-e2e`, and `contracts-bedrock` for increased utility. ([#17366](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17366))
- **OP Legacy Header Verification Fix**: An issue where OP Legacy header verification was not correctly dispatched was fixed, ensuring proper handling of legacy headers. ([#697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/697))
- **Operator Fee Calculation Fix**: A fix was implemented for the operator fee calculation in `op-geth`, addressing a previous rewrite attempt. ([#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/696))
- **Conductor Operations Improvement**: A typo in the `op-conductor-ops` tool was corrected to ensure new members are not always assigned as voters, improving accuracy and flexibility. ([#492](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/492))
- **Dispute Monitor Sync Handling Fix**: `op-dispute-mon` was fixed to handle out-of-sync nodes by using in-sync nodes as the source of truth. ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814))
