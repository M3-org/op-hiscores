On Aug 24, 2025, Optimism's development focused on optimizing Cannon's fault proof execution logging and refining `op-node` documentation examples. A new issue was opened to track an interoperability Proof of Concept, signaling future cross-chain efforts, while discussions continued on monitoring and alerting for flashblocks integration.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - **Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerting Improvements**: Input is needed on establishing comprehensive monitoring and alerting for flashblocks integration, particularly regarding specific SLAs for block progression and divergence, monitoring of pending transactions, and flashblocks-related SLA metrics. ([#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16388))

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Fault Proof System Optimization**:
    - Reduced excessive log output during Cannon fault proof executions by decreasing the default progress logging frequency from every 100,000 steps to every 1,000,000 steps. ([#17186](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17186))
- **Documentation Clarity**:
    - Improved `op-node` command-line examples by ensuring proper line continuation with backslashes, preventing copy-paste issues or shell parsing errors. ([#16753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16753))
