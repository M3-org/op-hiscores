On Aug 6, 2025, the Optimism project saw significant activity around calldata limits, with new pull requests opened in `op-geth`, `specs`, and `optimism` to address this area, indicating a focused effort on optimizing transaction costs and defining related protocol specifications. Additionally, a new PR was opened in `optimism` to explore `op-service` optimization.
