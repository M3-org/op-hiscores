On Aug 15, 2025, the project saw significant activity around core infrastructure updates, particularly concerning Go 1.24 support for Cannon and ongoing discussions about the Data Availability Footprint Limit. A key development is the potential removal of the entire event system, which could impact existing `op-service` components.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/docs` [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16874) and `ethereum-optimism/optimism` [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16874): The team is leaning towards removing the entire event system, which suggests the proposed PR might not be merged, requiring a decision on the future of event handling.

## üèóÔ∏è Work in Progress
