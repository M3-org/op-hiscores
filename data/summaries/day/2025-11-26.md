On November 26, 2025, the Optimism project saw significant progress in refining its ZK proof generation strategy and enhancing smart contract robustness, alongside routine automated updates to the Superchain registry. Discussions continued on optimizing the `AnchorStateRegistry` dependency and documenting the Universal Proofs system, while new pull requests focused on deployment tools, contract testing, and batcher throttling documentation.

## 🚨 Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**: Input is needed on [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18347) regarding the `AnchorStateRegistry` dependency to decide on the best approach for maintaining sanity checks while removing `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Superchain Registry Maintenance
- An automated code generation update was performed, modifying `addresses.json`, `chainList.json`, and `chainList.toml` to keep registry files current ([#1168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1168)).

### Smart Contract Robustness & Deployment Tools
- The `op-deployer` was enhanced with backported Forge verification scripts to streamline the deployment and verification process for `op-contracts/v5.0.0` ([#18352](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18352)).
- `OPContractsManagerV2` was improved to prevent `address(0)` from being provided as `SystemConfig` during an upgrade, enhancing robustness ([#18376](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18376)).
- Contract testing was refactored to use `vm.prank(address,bool)` for `delegateCall`, removing the `DelegateCaller` contract ([#18331](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18331)).
- A `WithArchive` matcher was introduced in `op-devstack` for Pectra acceptance tests ([#18227](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18227)).

### Proofs System Documentation
- A runbook for routing and understanding the Proofs system was produced and shared, clarifying which runbook to use for any given proofs deployment based on on-chain information ([#18372](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18372)).

### Active Discussions
- **ZK Proof Generation and Challenger Strategy**: Discussions continue across [#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18319), [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18322) (and their counterparts in `docs` and `optimism`) regarding the strategy for generating ZK proofs, the role of the succinct Rust challenger, and the long-term shift to a Rust stack.
- **VM-Runner ZK Execution Support**: Issue [#18325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18325) (and its counterparts in `docs` and `optimism`) is actively discussing how to update `vm-runner` to support ZK execution, acknowledging the need for Rust due to SP1 dependency.

## ✨ Contributor Spotlight
- **Inphi** (across `superchain-registry`, `docs`, and `optimism`): Provided significant input and suggestions on critical issues, including ZK proof generation strategies, `vm-runner` ZK execution support, and `AnchorStateRegistry` dependency refinement, and produced the Universal Proofs system runbook.
