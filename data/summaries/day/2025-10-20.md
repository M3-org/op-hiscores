Today's focus across the Optimism project involved significant build system and testing infrastructure enhancements, alongside continued discussions on critical protocol-level issues such as the DA Footprint Limit and `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` marshalling for Jovian. Development also included updates to testnet configurations, improvements to developer tooling like `op-up`, and the opening of numerous new pull requests spanning testing, Superchain components, and documentation.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - `optimism/optimism` [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17551): The DA Footprint Limit implementation is blocked pending investigation into why block 1 after genesis still has a 0 gas scalar, which is a spec derivation issue.
    - `ethereum-optimism.github.io` [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17551): DA Footprint Limit implementation is blocked by a pending spec derivation, referencing `optimism/issues/17946`.
    - `op-geth` [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17551): DA Footprint Limit implementation is blocked, dependent on spec derivation in `optimism/issues/17946`.
    - `superchain-ops` [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17551): DA Footprint Limit implementation is blocked by a pending spec derivation in another repository.
    - `docs` [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17551): DA Footprint Limit implementation is blocked by a spec derivation issue in the `optimism` repository.
    - `specs` [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17551): DA Footprint Limit implementation is blocked by a related spec derivation issue in the main Optimism repository.
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `optimism/optimism` [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17907): Discussion is ongoing regarding whether to update `op-succinct/kailua` directly or add a nullable system config to avoid breaking zk stacks due to `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` changes.
    - `ethereum-optimism.github.io` [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17907): Internal discussion is planned to assess updating `op-succinct/kailua` versus adding a nullable system config for `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` to avoid uncoordinated API changes.
    - `op-geth` [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17907): A plan to consult with @emilianobonassi regarding preventing marshaling new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active is underway.
    - `superchain-ops` [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17907): Discussion continues on whether to update `op-succinct/kailua` or introduce nullable system config fields for `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` to avoid uncoordinated API changes.
    - `docs` [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17907): Discussion revolves around updating `op-succinct/kailua` directly or justifying the change on the grounds of not updating APIs in an uncoordinated way for `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig`.
    - `specs` [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17907): A team member is checking the feasibility of implementing a nullable system config for `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` to address its impact on zk stacks.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Build System and CI Enhancements
- Critical fixes were implemented to improve the stability and reliability of the build and continuous integration processes, including removing Makefile sharding and fixing the `mise` version in Docker builds.
    - `optimism` [#17930](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17930)
    - `optimism` [#17954](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17954)
### Protocol Specification Clarifications
- A pull request was merged to clarify the absence of transactions in the genesis block for both the Jovian and Isthmus protocols, enhancing the accuracy of the `l1-attributes.md` specifications.
    - `specs` [#801](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/801)
### Data and Configuration Updates
- LSK addresses were updated by adding a new LSK address for the Base network.
    - `ethereum-optimism.github.io` [#1210](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1210)
- Stylistic changes were made to the `LivenessModule2` and `TimelockGuard` contracts within the SaferSafes suite for better alignment and readability.
    - `optimism` [#17903](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17903)
