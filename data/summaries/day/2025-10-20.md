Today's development saw significant progress in foundational infrastructure with critical bug fixes to the build system and CI processes, alongside foundational changes to `op-geth` for BN254 curve operations. A key focus across multiple repositories was addressing the ongoing challenges of Jovian compatibility, particularly concerning `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` changes, and improving `op-up` for local development environments.

## 🚨 Needs Attention 
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io` [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17551): DA Footprint Limit implementation is blocked by a spec derivation issue in another repository.
    - `ethereum-optimism/op-geth` [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17551): DA Footprint Limit implementation is blocked by the spec derivation outlined in `optimism/issues/17946`.
    - `ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops` [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17551): DA Footprint Limit implementation is blocked by a pending spec derivation in another repository.
    - `ethereum-optimism/docs` [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17551): DA Footprint Limit implementation is blocked by a spec derivation issue in the `optimism` repository, specifically `ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17946`.
    - `ethereum-optimism/specs` [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17551): DA Footprint Limit implementation is blocked by a related spec derivation issue in the `optimism` repository.
    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism` [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17551): DA Footprint Limit implementation is blocked by the investigation into why block 1 after genesis still has a 0 gas scalar, considered a spec derivation issue.
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io` [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17907): Discussion on delaying marshalling new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active to avoid breaking zk stacks, with a team member checking with another contributor about justifying this change due to uncoordinated API updates.
    - `ethereum-optimism/op-geth` [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17907): Discussion on whether to avoid marshaling new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active, with a suggestion to check with @emilianobonassi regarding justifying such a change.
    - `ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops` [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17907): Discussion on whether to update `op-succinct`/`kailua` or introduce nullable system config fields to avoid breaking zk stacks, and the possibility of justifying the change to prevent uncoordinated API updates.
    - `ethereum-optimism/docs` [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17907): Discussion on whether to avoid marshaling new fields to prevent breaking zk stacks or if updating `op-succinct/kailua` is a viable alternative, and the possibility of justifying the change on the grounds of not updating APIs in an uncoordinated way.
    - `ethereum-optimism/specs` [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17907): Discussion on whether to update `op-succinct/kailua` directly or to implement a nullable system config, with a check planned with @emilianobonassi.
    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism` [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17907): Discussion on whether to avoid marshaling new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SystemConfig` until Jovian is active, with a follow-up planned to discuss updating `op-succinct/kailua` instead.
