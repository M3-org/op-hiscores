Today, significant progress was made on simplifying the Kona node actor design and enhancing `op-deployer` with OPCM v2 support for chain upgrades. Multiple issues related to blob priority fee tracking and a potential bug in `op-node` sequencer recovery mode were closed across several repositories, indicating resolution of these long-standing concerns, though a new artifact extraction bug was reported across multiple repos.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**: `ethereum-optimism/design-docs` [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102) The blob tip oracle is deployed and suggests lower priority fees than the current configured minimum, indicating overpayment and a need to utilize the oracle's suggestions soon.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Protocol Simplification & Kona Integration
- **Kona Node Actor Design Simplification**: A proposal was introduced to simplify the Kona node actor design, aiming to decrease complexity and increase testability by consolidating and deleting unnecessary code without altering functionality. [ethereum-optimism/design-docs#358](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/358)
- **Kona Light CL Support**: Support for Kona light CL was added to `op-devstack`, allowing for more flexible configuration of L2 consensus clients. [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18627](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18627)
- **`op-sync-tester` Kona Integration**: The `op-sync-tester` was updated to support `engine_exchangeCapabilities`, which is crucial for Kona integration and testing. [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18628)

### Deployment and Transaction Management Enhancements
- **OPCM v2 Support for `op-deployer`**: The `op-deployer` tool received a significant upgrade with the addition of OPCM v2 support for chain upgrades, enabling more robust and flexible deployment processes. [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18593](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18593)
- **`op-deployer` Max Code Size Override**: `op-deployer` will now ignore max-code-size limits during deployment, streamlining the developer experience for devnet setups. [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18642)
- **New `BlobGasPriceOracle` Module**: A new `BlobGasPriceOracle` module was introduced to `op-service`, designed to track and cache blob prices for more efficient transaction management. [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18386)

### Ecosystem and Analytics Updates
- **World Chain Sepolia Token Integration**: A new token, AMIE, was added to the World Chain Sepolia testnet, including its details and logo, expanding supported tokens within the ecosystem. [ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io#1243](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1243)
