On Feb 3, 2025, the primary focus was on addressing `op-node` sync problems by proposing the deprecation of the `req-resp` P2P sync protocol in favor of a simpler, more efficient alternative. Discussions centered on the benefits of this new approach for faster scaling and recovery within the Superchain.

## 🚨 Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**: The discussion on `op-node` sync protocol alternatives in [#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14108) requires input to move forward with the deprecation of `req-resp` P2P sync and the adoption of a new mechanism.
