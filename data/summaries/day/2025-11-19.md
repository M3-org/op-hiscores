On November 19, 2025, Optimism's development focused on refining core infrastructure, particularly around hardfork activation recovery and `min-base-fee` configurations, alongside a significant `go-ethereum` client update. Documentation efforts for the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades are actively progressing, with a shift in strategy to monitor `min-base-fee` performance directly in production environments.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/design-docs`: Discussions continue regarding the documentation of the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades, with the docs team receiving a one-pager. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18095))
    - `ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry`: Documentation of the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades is ongoing, with a one-pager provided to the docs team. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18095))
    - `ethereum-optimism/op-geth`: The need to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades is highlighted, with a one-pager received by the documentation team. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095))
    - `ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops`: Discussions continue on documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades, with a one-pager provided to the docs team. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18095))

    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism`: Discussion on documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades continues, with a one-pager received by the docs team and agreement with devrel to highlight this for the U18 upgrade. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18095))

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Protocol Enhancements & Security
- An alternative recovery method for hardfork activation was added, enhancing the robustness of system upgrade procedures. ([#357](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/357))
- Bounds for the minimum base fee were added to the standard configuration for mainnet and Sepolia, enhancing protocol security and stability. ([#1127](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1127), [#1163](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1163))
- A major update to the underlying `go-ethereum` client was merged, bringing `v1.16.4` into `op-geth`, refreshing core functionalities and dependencies. ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/689))

### Infrastructure & Tooling Improvements
- Routine automated updates to the `superchain-registry` codebase were performed, ensuring data and structure are consistently up-to-date. ([#1161](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1161), [#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1162))
- A new integration test was added to improve coverage for `RevShareContractsUpgraderIntegration.t.sol`, ensuring better reliability for contract upgrades. ([#1302](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1302))
- The `mise.toml` configuration was updated to include `jq` with a specific version, resolving issues with script execution. ([#1300](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1300))
- The `op-deployer` now records its version in intent and state files, improving visibility into deployed contracts. ([#18333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18333))
