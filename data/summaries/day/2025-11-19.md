On Nov 19, 2025, significant progress was made on integrating `go-ethereum v1.16.4` into `op-geth` and enhancing `op-deployer` with versioning. Across multiple repositories, the `min-base-fee` feature evaluation concluded with a decision to monitor its production performance, and discussions continued on documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upcoming upgrades.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/design-docs`: Discussion continues on documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades, especially for the U18 upgrade, with the docs team provided information. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18095))
    - `ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry`: Discussion continues on documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades, with a one-pager provided to the docs team. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18095))
    - `ethereum-optimism/op-geth`: Discussions are ongoing regarding the documentation of the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades, relevant for the U18 upgrade. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095))
    - `ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops`: Discussion continues on documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades, relevant for the U18 upgrade. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18095))
    - `ethereum-optimism/docs`: Discussions continued on documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for standard chain upgrades, with a one-pager provided to the docs team. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18095))
    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism`: Discussions continue on documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades, a concern for the U18 upgrade. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18095))

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Protocol & Infrastructure Updates
- **`op-geth` Integration**: A major merge of `go-ethereum v1.16.4` was completed, integrating upstream changes across numerous core components like `accounts/usbwallet`, `cmd/evm`, and `cmd/keeper`. ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/689))
- **Hardfork Activation Recovery**: An alternative recovery method for hardfork activation was added to `design-docs`, improving system robustness. ([#357](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/357))

### Superchain Configuration & Tooling
- **Superchain Configuration Parameters**: Bounds for minimum base fees were added to the standard configuration for mainnet and Sepolia in `superchain-registry`, enhancing protocol stability. ([#1127](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1127), [#1163](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1163))
- **`op-deployer` Versioning**: The `op-deployer` tool in `optimism` now records `opDeployerVersion` in intent and state files to retain crucial deployment information. ([#18333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18333))
- **Automated Code Generation**: Routine automated updates to the `superchain-registry` codebase were performed, ensuring consistency. ([#1161](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1161), [#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1162))
- **Tooling and Scripting Updates**: The `mise.toml` configuration in `superchain-ops` was updated to align `jq` version, addressing a compatibility issue. ([#1300](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1300))

### Testing & Documentation Enhancements
- **Testing Enhancements**: A new integration test was added to `superchain-ops` to improve testing of the `RevShareContractsUpgraderIntegration.t.sol` contract. ([#1302](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1302))
- **Documentation**: A README for the U17 sep uni execution was added to `superchain-ops`. ([#1303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1303))
