On Nov 12, 2025, Optimism significantly enhanced its infrastructure security and CI/CD pipelines, with critical bug fixes for `proxyd` and `mise`, alongside extensive work on U17 Sepolia stack upgrades. Key discussions continued on optimizing `op-node`'s safe-head advancement and documenting `cannonKonaPrestate` for upcoming upgrades, while new GitHub Actions workflows were introduced for `op-geth` building and attestation.

## 🚨 Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/infra` [#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15393): Discussion on `op-node`'s single aggregate safe-head advancement FCU message per channel needs input on `Concluding` flag logic and debounce for engine-controller FCU code.
    - `ethereum-optimism/infra` [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18095): The devrel team agrees on highlighting `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement in Optimism documentation for U18 upgrade; further updates are needed once documentation is set up.
    - `ethereum-optimism/infra` [#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18246): Discussion on improving batcher safeguards on SystemConfig updates needs further input, potentially related to `optimism/issues/17490`.
    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism` [#18258](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18258): An intermittent CI failure in `check-for-changes` step, potentially linked to a `checkout` workaround, requires investigation.
    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism` [#18261](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18261): Acceptance tests are sporadically timing out, indicating potential instability in the testing environment that needs addressing.
