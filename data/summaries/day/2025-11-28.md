On November 28, 2025, significant progress was made across the Optimism ecosystem, including the introduction of a new revenue-sharing feature with the `FeeSplitter` predeploy in `specs`, and the resolution of a recurring `op deployer` configuration issue across multiple repositories. Additionally, `superchain-ops` addressed audit findings for the `RevSharesContractUpgrader`, and `optimism` refined its testing infrastructure by replacing mock contracts with Foundry's `vm` functions.

## ✅ Completed Work

### Revenue Sharing & Contract Upgrades
*   **ethereum-optimism/specs**: A new revenue-sharing feature was introduced with the `FeeSplitter` predeploy, aiming for more modular and automated revenue distribution ([#782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/782)).
*   **ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops**: Informational findings from the `RevSharesContractUpgrader` audit were addressed, improving the reliability of the revenue sharing contract upgrade process ([#1308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1308)).

### Registry Maintenance & Testing Infrastructure
*   **ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry**: An automated codegen update was performed to keep the registry current, modifying `chainList.json`, `chainList.toml`, and `superchain/extra/addresses/addresses.json` ([#1170](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1170)).
*   **ethereum-optimism/optimism**: The testing suite was improved by replacing mock contracts with `vm.mock` functions for `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, `FeeVault`, `L2CrossDomainMessenger`, `SequencerFeeVault`, and `Transactor` within `contracts-bedrock` ([#18388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18388)).

## 🐞 Issue Triage

### Closed Issues
*   **ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry**: The issue concerning the `op deployer` reverting with custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values was closed, with the problem identified as a validation requirement where `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` must be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration` ([#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18407)).
*   **ethereum-optimism/specs**: An issue regarding `op deployer` reverting with custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values was closed, identified as a validation constraint requiring `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` to be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration` ([#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18407)).
*   **ethereum-optimism/optimism**: An issue where `op-deployer` reverted when using custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values was closed, with the problem identified as a validation check requiring `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` to be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration` ([#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18407)).
