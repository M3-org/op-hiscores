On Nov 28, 2025, Optimism's development focused on enhancing revenue sharing mechanisms with the introduction of the `FeeSplitter` predeploy, alongside critical fixes for `RevSharesContractUpgrader` audit findings. A significant recurring issue concerning `op deployer` configuration with custom fault game parameters was resolved across multiple repositories, clarifying validation requirements for testnet deployments.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Revenue Sharing & Contract Upgrades
*   Introduced the `FeeSplitter` predeploy to enable an opt-in, modular, and configurable revenue-sharing mechanism, updating various protocol specifications in `ethereum-optimism/specs`. ([#782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/782))
*   Addressed informational findings from the `RevSharesContractUpgrader` audit, improving the reliability of the revenue sharing contract upgrade process in `ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops`. ([#1308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1308))

### Deployment & Testing Infrastructure Improvements
*   Performed an automated code generation update, modifying `chainList.json`, `chainList.toml`, and `superchain/extra/addresses/addresses.json` in `ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry`. ([#1170](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1170))
*   Replaced mock contracts with `vm.mock` functions in various contract tests, streamlining the testing process in `ethereum-optimism/optimism`. ([#18388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18388))

## 🐞 Issue Triage
### Closed Issues
*   **ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry**
    *   The issue concerning `op deployer` reverting with custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values was closed, with the resolution identified as a validation requirement and the need to override `PreimageOracleChallengePeriod` for testnet deployments. ([#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18407))
*   **ethereum-optimism/optimism**
    *   An issue where `op-deployer` reverted with custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values was closed, confirming the resolution involved a validation requirement and overriding `PreimageOracleChallengePeriod` for testnets. ([#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18407))
