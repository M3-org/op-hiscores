On Nov 24, 2025, the Optimism project saw significant progress in integrating `op-reth` into acceptance tests and enhancing the OP Stack with custom gas token capabilities. Multiple documentation issues received community interest, while new issues highlighted performance and RPC challenges on Base Mainnet.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18362](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18362): Intermittent timeouts for `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_sendTransaction` on Base Mainnet during high gas price periods need investigation.
    - [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18364](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18364): L2 RPC request failures with custom Base Sequencer configurations require attention.
    - [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18366](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18366): `op-batcher`'s suboptimal batch submission timing on Base Mainnet, leading to increased L1 gas costs and delayed transaction finality, needs to be addressed.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Protocol Enhancements
- **Custom Gas Token Integration**: A new feature was added to enable OP Stack chains to use assets other than ETH as their native fee currency, introducing a flexible Custom Gas Token (CGT) mechanism. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18076](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18076))

### CI/CD and Testing Improvements
- **Comprehensive Fuzz Testing**: Heavy fuzz tests now incorporate the dev feature matrix for broader coverage. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18368](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18368))
- **CI Stability Fixes**: A fix was implemented to skip validation for missing test artifacts, improving CI stability. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18367](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18367))
- **Resource Upgrade for E2E Tests**: The `op-e2e-cannon-tests` job was upgraded to use a larger machine to prevent resource-related failures. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18359](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18359))

### Contract and Release Management
- **Safe Directory Consistency**: All Safe directory changes from the `develop` branch were cherry-picked to the `op-safe-contracts/v1.0.0` branch. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18371](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18371))
- **Reliable Release Binary Provider**: The GitHub release binary provider was updated with version checks and a static cache pather for improved reliability. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18369](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18369))
