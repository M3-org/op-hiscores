Today, significant progress was made on infrastructure upgrades with the deployment of the U17 Jovian Upgrade to OP betanets and sepolia-dev-0, alongside critical discussions on `proxyd`'s backend synchronization challenges and blob priority fee tracking. Additionally, RetroPGF Round 8 - Milestone 9 draft results were added for QA, and several new tokens were integrated across various networks, expanding the Optimism ecosystem.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - **`proxyd` Backwards Time Travel**: The issue of `proxyd` returning outdated blocks when backends are out of sync (affecting `eth_call`, `eth_estimateGas`, and `eth_feeHistory`) requires a decision on the best mitigation strategy among "multicall", "block out of range" awareness, or sticky sessions. Input is needed on [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/501), [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/501), [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/501), [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/501), [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/501), [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/501), [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/501), [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/501), and [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/501).
    - **Blob Priority Fee Tracking**: Discussion is ongoing regarding the optimal approach for `op-batcher/txmgr`'s blob priority fee tracking, weighing a "decay" mechanism against a more comprehensive dedicated tracker. Input is needed on [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102), [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18102), [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18102), [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102), [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18102), [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18102), [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18102), [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18102), and [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18102).
    - **`migrate` Method Update**: Clarification is needed on the status of the `migrate` method issue, as OPCM changes are tracked separately from devstack changes, suggesting it might be ready for closure. Input is needed on [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17743), [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17743), [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17743), [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17743), [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17743), [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17743), [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17743), [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17743), and [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17743).
    - **`op-acceptance-tests`: Sysgo Support for Flashblocks / Rbuilders**: There is a desire to implement sysgo support for flashblocks/rbuilders to validate `kona-node` and `rollup-boost` changes. Input is needed on [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16450), [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16450), [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16450), [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16450), [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16450), and [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16450).
