Today, Optimism focused on core infrastructure improvements, migrating the `SuperFaultDisputeGame` to a creator pattern for enhanced e2e testing and stabilizing Docker builds. Additionally, efforts continued to expand token support with a new pull request to add the POLS token.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Dispute Game Contract Refinements
- The `SuperFaultDisputeGame` was migrated to a creator pattern, implementing necessary OPCM functions for e2e testing, impacting `op-chain-ops`, `op-deployer`, `op-devstack`, and `contracts-bedrock`. ([#17981](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17981))

### Build Process Improvements
- A new `builder_foundry` build stage was introduced to stabilize and simplify the Docker build process. ([#18013](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18013))
