Today, the Optimism team focused on core infrastructure improvements, including refactoring the `SuperFaultDisputeGame` for e2e testing and stabilizing Docker builds within the `optimism` repository. Additionally, a new pull request was opened to expand the content on the Optimism website by adding the POLS token.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Protocol Refactoring & Build Improvements
- Migrated the `SuperFaultDisputeGame` to a creator pattern, implementing necessary OPCM functions for e2e testing, which is a step towards fully migrating `addGameType`, `updatePrestate`, and `deploy` to use v2 games in [ethereum-optimism/optimism#17981](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17981).
- Introduced a new `builder_foundry` build stage to stabilize and simplify Docker builds in [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18013](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18013).
