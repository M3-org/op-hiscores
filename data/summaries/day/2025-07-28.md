Overall Project Summary for Jul 28, 2025:

The primary focus across the Optimism ecosystem today was the initial implementation and specification of a configurable minimum base fee, with new pull requests and issues opened in `op-geth`, `optimism`, and `specs` to support this feature. Additionally, efforts were made in `optimism` to address Superchain configuration upgrades and enhance monitoring for flashblocks-enabled sequencers.
