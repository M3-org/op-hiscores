Today, Optimism's development focused on enhancing the `op-devstack` with improved feature management and observability, alongside critical bug fixes for subprocess handling and acceptance tests. Significant progress was also made in refining CI processes and testing infrastructure, while documentation saw improvements in structure and the removal of outdated references. A recurring challenge across multiple repositories involves the marshaling of new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SystemConfig` breaking zk stacks, and ongoing discussions aim to resolve race conditions in `op-devstack` acceptance tests.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - **ethereum-optimism/infra**: Discussion continues on [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17907) regarding `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` marshaling issues, with a new field `daFootprintGasScalar` causing breakage for zk stacks. Input is needed on versioning or clearer expectations for RPC method bodies to prevent breaking third-party integrations.
    - **ethereum-optimism/infra**: Issue [#18063](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18063) needs further input on resolving race conditions in `op-devstack` tests, specifically on strengthening the `*dsl.EOA` abstraction or consistently using unique wallets funded by faucets.
    - **ethereum-optimism/infra**: Discussion on [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18070) requires input on automatically detecting L2 chain IDs for L3s to skip L1 chain configuration in `op-node` and `op-program`.
    - **ethereum-optimism/specs**: Active discussion on [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17907) highlights the need for versioning or clearer expectations for RPC method bodies due to `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` changes breaking zk stacks.

    - **ethereum-optimism/specs**: Further discussion is required on [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18070) regarding the automatic detection of L2 chain IDs for L3s to simplify L1 chain configuration.
    - **ethereum-optimism/docs**: Issue [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18070) needs input on automatically detecting L2 chain IDs for L3s to simplify L1 chain configuration in `op-node` and `op-program`.
    - **ethereum-optimism/docs**: Discussion on [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17907) requires input on versioning or clearer expectations for RPC method bodies to prevent `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` changes from breaking zk stacks and third-party integrations.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Devstack Enhancements & Stability
- The `op-devstack` now supports individual dev features, allowing for easier combination and preventing accidental disabling of features ([#17994](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17994)).
- CI has been updated to properly run dev features through the contracts test suite, improving test coverage and reliability ([#18051](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18051)).
- Critical bug fixes were implemented to address race conditions in `op-devstack`'s subprocess handling, resolving occasional test flakes ([#17815](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17815)).
- Monitoring capabilities have been enabled in `sysgo`, adding L2 observability to `op-devstack` for better insights into network health ([#18017](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18017)).

### Documentation & Specification Improvements
- Detailed specifications were added for several critical contracts, enhancing clarity and understanding of their functionalities within the Optimism ecosystem, including L2StandardBridge ([#843](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/843)), L1Block predeploy ([#842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/842)), and L1StandardBridge ([#844](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/844)).
- A comprehensive specification for the PreimageOracle contract was created, detailing its role in providing data availability for fault proof execution ([#845](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/845)).
- Various broken links were fixed and several documentation files were restructured to improve navigation and accuracy, particularly within `app-developers` and `chain-operators` guides ([#1821](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1821)).
- Quick fixes were implemented to documentation, including updates to `docs.json` and `reference/contribute/docs-contribute.mdx` ([#1820](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1820)).
- All references to Kurtosis were removed from the documentation, including `chain-operators/tutorials/chain-dev-net.mdx` and `keywords.config.yaml` ([#1817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1817)).

### Acceptance Test & VM Refinements
- Two papercuts in `op-acceptance-tests` were fixed, addressing spammer warning logs and DA footprint test retries ([#18067](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18067)).
- The Cannon "next" VM handling in e2e tests was reworked for cleaner implementation and re-enabled skipping of "next" tests ([#18064](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18064)).
- The spammer budget in `op-acceptance-tests` was increased to prevent insufficient funds errors ([#18080](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18080)).
