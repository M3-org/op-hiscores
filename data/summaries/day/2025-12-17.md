Optimism Daily Project Summary (Dec 17, 2025)

Today, the Optimism team focused on critical infrastructure improvements, including a Next.js security upgrade and enhancements to contract verification with OPCM V2 support. Simultaneously, significant discussions continued across multiple repositories regarding persistent node synchronization issues, the architectural simplification of interop transaction handling, and the re-evaluation of proofs action testing for Supernodes.

## 🚨 Needs Attention

- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - **Node Synchronization Issues**: Users are experiencing "missing trie node" errors and "Failed to build payload" errors, indicating potential state database corruption or incompleteness. Troubleshooting steps have been provided, but the issue persists, with users considering switching to Reth or needing guidance on OP-GETH downloads. Input is needed on [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18581), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18581).
    - **Interop Transaction Rework**: Active debate continues on simplifying the interop specification by removing the additional replacement transaction, especially in the context of ZK proofs. Architectural refactoring and Interop specification updates are the next steps. Input is needed on [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574), [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18574), [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18574), [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18574), [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574), [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18574).
    - **Proofs Action Testing for Supernodes**: Discussions are ongoing about adapting action testing for the Supernode architecture, with a strong sentiment that challenger tests should run against a "real" Supernode. Input is needed on [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18621), [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18621), [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18621), [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18621), [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18621), [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18621).
    - **File-Relative Paths vs. Project-Relative Paths**: A potential solution using "context aware remappings" has been identified for compilation issues related to project-relative paths, but the broader discussion on adopting file-relative paths for better portability continues. Input is needed on [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/10202), [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/10202), [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/10202), [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/10202), [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10202), [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/10202).
