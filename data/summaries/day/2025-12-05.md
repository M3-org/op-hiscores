On Dec 5, 2025, the Optimism project focused on critical infrastructure stability, particularly addressing `op-node` synchronization issues affecting multiple deployments, while also making significant strides in RetroPGF M10 result finalization and enhancing CI/CD security. Documentation improvements and core contract testing also saw notable progress, alongside ongoing discussions for devnet tooling and acceptance test enhancements.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [ethereum-optimism/op-geth#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18510): `op-node` v1.16.3 is preventing Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments from synchronizing; specific `op-geth` and `op-node` image versions have been clarified.
    - [ethereum-optimism/op-geth#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16450): An update is needed on whether `sysgo` support for flashblocks and rbuilders is complete to enable related tests.
    - [ethereum-optimism/op-geth#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18482): Input is needed on whether `flashbots/contender` is a sufficient starting point for a new `op-spammer` component, potentially negating the need for a new component.
