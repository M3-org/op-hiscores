Today, significant progress was made on refining RetroPGF M10 results with weight adjustments for onchain builders, alongside critical CI/CD security enhancements and expanded testing for core contracts. A major cross-cutting challenge emerged with `op-node` v1.16.3 causing synchronization failures across Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments, which is actively being investigated.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussion**: `op-node` v1.16.3 is causing synchronization failures for Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments, with specific `op-geth` and `op-node` image versions identified; further investigation and resolution are critical. ([ethereum-optimism/op-geth#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18510), [ethereum-optimism/specs#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18510), [ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18510), [ethereum-optimism/docs#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18510), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18510))
- **Urgent Discussion**: Confirmation is needed on whether `sysgo` support for flashblocks/rbuilders in `op-acceptance-tests` is complete to validate `kona-node + rollup-boost` changes. ([ethereum-optimism/op-geth#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16450), [ethereum-optimism/specs#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16450), [ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16450), [ethereum-optimism/docs#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16450), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16450))
- **Urgent Discussion**: Input is needed on whether existing "prior art" like `flashbots/contender` is sufficient for the new `op-spammer` component for devnet deployments. ([ethereum-optimism/op-geth#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18482), [ethereum-optimism/specs#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18482), [ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18482), [ethereum-optimism/docs#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18482), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18482))

## ✅ Completed Work
### RetroPGF M10 Results Refinement
- Draft results for RetroPGF Season 8, Round 10 (M10) were added, including updated queries and calculated results for both devtooling and onchain categories. ([ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding#86](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/86))
- Weights for onchain builders were updated to further refine the M10 results. ([ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding#87](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/87))
- Further tweaks were made to the weights for onchain builders. ([ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding#88](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/88))

### CI/CD and Deployment Process Improvements
- The `op-deployer` build and compress commands were integrated for publishing artifacts, ensuring consistency and enabling uploaded artifacts. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18488](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18488))
- The `FeesDepositor` address and minimum withdrawal amount were updated in genesis configurations. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18490))
- CI/CD security was enhanced by reducing permissions for fork builds and fixing tag releases, with Docker CI workflows split for secure handling of release tag pushes and branch/PR distinctions. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18501))

### Core Contract Testing and Monitoring Enhancements
- New tests were added for `OPContractsManagerV2.deploy` to improve contract reliability. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18486](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18486))
- `op-conductor` now includes first-class support for Kona health checks, alongside existing rollup-boost health checks, to ensure robust monitoring. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18453](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18453))

### Documentation Updates
- SEO metadata was added to the documentation site to improve search engine visibility. ([ethereum-optimism/docs#1904](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1904))
- A missing minimum blob configuration was restored to the batcher documentation, resolving an issue related to incomplete documentation. ([ethereum-optimism/docs#1903](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1903))
- An update was made to `derivation.md` within the `specs/protocol/holocene` directory. ([ethereum-optimism/specs#866](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/866))
