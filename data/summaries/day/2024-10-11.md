Overall Project Summary:
Today's primary focus across the project was on identifying and addressing a critical refactoring need within the `optimism` repository for fault proof contracts to support `Creator` contracts, aiming to improve upgrade processes and significantly reduce deployment costs. This refactoring is essential for scaling the Superchain ecosystem by enabling more efficient L2 chain updates.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism` [#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421): Input is needed on the re-evaluation and prioritization of refactoring dispute game contracts to remove immutables, which is a bottleneck for scaling upgrade processes due to high deployment costs.

## üèóÔ∏è Work in Progress
- **Active Discussions**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism` [#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421): Discussion is ongoing regarding the refactoring of fault proof contracts to support `Creator` contracts, specifically to remove immutables from dispute game contracts to allow for shared implementations across chains and reduce deployment costs.

## üêû Issue Triage
- **New Issues**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism` [#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421): A new issue was opened to address the critical need for refactoring fault proof contracts to support `Creator` contracts, which is vital for improving upgrade processes and reducing deployment costs.
