Optimism's development today saw significant advancements in core contract management with the introduction of OPCM v2 and the specification for Custom Gas Token (CGT) support, alongside continued investigation into a critical `op-node` sequencer recovery mode bug. Analytical capabilities were enhanced with a new EIP-1559 fee market analysis tool, while the Jovian fork is now activated by default for new chains, streamlining Superchain deployments.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `op-node` Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18350), [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18350), [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18350), [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18350), [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18350)): This critical bug, potentially stalling derivation and violating sequencer drift rules, requires immediate input to resolve temporary errors and understand the influence of asynchronous L1 origin fetching.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Protocol & Contract Management
- **OPCM v2 Introduction and Enhancements**: Overhauled the Optimism Contracts Manager with new interfaces, deployment scripts, and testing infrastructure, significantly impacting `IOPContractsManager`, `SystemConfig`, and `OPContractsManager.sol`. ([#18079](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18079))
- **Deployment Verification Improvements**: Added Blockscout verification support to `VerifyOPCM`, enhancing the deployment verification process. ([#18373](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18373), [#18384](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18384))
- **Jovian Fork Default Activation**: Activated the Jovian fork by default at genesis for new chains, streamlining the setup process for new Superchain deployments. ([#18348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18348))

### Superchain Ecosystem & Specifications
- **Custom Gas Token (CGT) Specification**: Introduced a major new feature defining technical requirements for CGT support across bridges, messengers, Optimism Portal, predeploys, system configuration, and withdrawals. ([#749](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/749))
- **RPC Configuration Updates**: Added a new RPC override environment variable and updated the status of U17 mainnet tasks to "executed." ([#1307](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1307))

### Analytics & Security
- **Fee Market Analysis Tooling**: Added initial analysis for the EIP-1559 base fee market, including a notebook, core script, helper functions, and configuration to model the next block's expected base fee. ([#1768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1768))
- **Security Secret Rotation**: Rotated secrets for authentication updates, enhancing system security. ([#1769](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1769))

### Active Discussions
- **OPCMv2 Enhancements and Future Considerations**: Discussions around using `getStartingAnchorRoot` for better accuracy and reduced diff once U18 is deployed ([#18381](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18381)) and removing `DelayedWETH` allowance after fresh deployment to support a unified model ([#18382](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18382)).

## 🐞 Issue Triage
### Closed Issues
- **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:
    - Default Fork Activation ([#18314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18314)): The issue concerning making Jovian the default fork to activate at genesis for new chains has been resolved.

### New Issues
- **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:
    - OPCMv2: use getStartingAnchorRoot instead of getAnchorRoot ([#18381](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18381)): Suggests using `getStartingAnchorRoot` for better accuracy and reduced diff once U18 is deployed.
    - OPCMv2: remove DelayedWETH allowance after fresh deployment ([#18382](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18382)): Notes the need to remove the `DelayedWETH` allowance to support the unified `DelayedWETH` model in a future upgrade.
