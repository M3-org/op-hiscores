On November 9, 2025, development primarily focused on enhancing testing infrastructure within the `optimism` repository, specifically improving the reliability and compatibility of `op-devstack` and `op-acceptance-tests` for Ecotone network fees and L2 fork requirements. Key efforts included refining devstack testing capabilities with new matchers and refactored L2 fork requirements, alongside de-flakifying Ecotone fees tests by ensuring network compatibility and precise balance readings.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18061](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18061): Discussion is needed to audit and remove problematic retries and timeouts in `op-devstack` that cause test flakes, particularly regarding hard-coded retry counts in `dsl.EOA.Plan` and the potential use of `txinclude.Includer` versus a separate `PlanFailure` method.

## 🏗️ Work in Progress
- **New Pull Requests**:
    - **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:
