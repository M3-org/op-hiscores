Today's development focused heavily on improving the testing infrastructure and development environment for `optimism`, with several new pull requests opened to address flakiness in Ecotone fee tests and enhance `op-devstack` capabilities.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18061](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18061): Discussion is needed on auditing retries and timeouts in `op-devstack`, specifically regarding hard-coded retry counts and potential solutions involving `txinclude.Includer` versus a separate `PlanFailure` method.
