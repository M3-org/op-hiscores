On July 15, 2025, the primary focus was on planning and outlining new features for `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` within the `optimism` repository, specifically to support the `engine` namespace and `sysgo` for enhanced sync testing and configuration. Several new issues were opened to expand testing capabilities and simplify configuration for these tools.

## 🏗️ Work in Progress

### Active Discussions
*   **ethereum-optimism/optimism**: Issue [#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16703) is actively discussing adding sync acceptance tests using the `sync-tester`, with specific test case ideas outlined, including OP Stack Hard Fork transitions, multi-CL syncing, and user transactions in L2 blocks.

## 🐞 Issue Triage

### New Issues
*   **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:
    *   Enhancements for `op-sync-tester` to support the `engine` namespace for RPC methods like `engine_newPayload` and `engine_forkchoiceUpdated` ([#16701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16701)).
    *   Integration of `sysgo` into `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` to simplify configuration and enable/disable features during system boot for testing ([#16702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16702)).
    *   Addition of sync acceptance tests utilizing the `op-sync-tester` ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16703)).
