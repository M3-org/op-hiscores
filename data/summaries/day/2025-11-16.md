On November 16, 2025, Optimism's development focused on significant documentation improvements, including navigation refactoring and snap sync guide enhancements, alongside critical infrastructure updates such as Kona host version upgrades and a fix for a flaking fuzz test in DisputeGameFactory. Additionally, a new Pylint analysis workflow was introduced to improve code quality in the `specs` repository.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Incomplete Documentation**: The `docs` repository has new issues regarding missing environment variable descriptions for `op-node` and `op-geth` ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1874)) and incomplete batcher configuration documentation ([#1876](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1876)), which require attention to improve developer experience.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Documentation Structure and Clarity
- **Navigation Refactoring**: Extensive refactoring of the documentation's navigation structure was completed across `app-developers`, `chain-operators`, `op-stack`, and `superchain` sections to improve content discoverability ([#1872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1872)).
- **Snap Sync Documentation Update**: The documentation for node operators, specifically concerning snap synchronization, was restructured to provide clearer guidance, addressing a previous request ([#1851](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1851), [#1772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1772)).

### Infrastructure and Protocol Enhancements
- **Kona Host Updates**: The Kona host version in the `op-challenger` docker image was updated to 1.2.2 and subsequently to 1.2.4, enabling cannon-kona acceptance tests due to new websocket support ([#18231](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18231), [#18302](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18302)).
- **Dispute Game Test Fixes**: A flaking fuzz test in `DisputeGameFactory` was fixed by accounting for `CANNON_KONA` game types, improving test reliability ([#18296](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18296)).
- **Cannon-Kona Integration Testing**: Integration testing for cannon-kona was completed, ensuring end-to-end test coverage ([#17764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17764)).

### Code Quality and Maintenance
- **Automated Registry Update**: An automated codegen update was performed on the `addresses.json` file within `superchain/extra`, ensuring the registry remains current ([#1156](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1156)).
