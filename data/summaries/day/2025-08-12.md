Overall Project Summary for Aug 12, 2025:

Today's development focused on foundational improvements and testing infrastructure across the Optimism ecosystem. Key activities included refactoring the `op-node` driver, enhancing local development environments with `op-geth` images, and drafting new test cases for calldata footprint analysis, alongside efforts to improve developer workflow by implementing retries for forge scripts. Additionally, new testing requirements were identified for Devstack, and a new pull request was opened to add ARCv2 token information to the Base network documentation.
