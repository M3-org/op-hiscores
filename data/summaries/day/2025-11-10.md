On November 10, 2025, Optimism's development focused on enhancing the `optimism` repository with significant refinements to the `op-devstack` for L2 fork management, bolstering testing infrastructure with Kona prestate support, and streamlining deployment scripts. Additionally, the `infra` repository saw the introduction of Zstandard compression support for improved data efficiency.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Devstack and Testing Infrastructure Enhancements
*   The `op-devstack` was refactored to improve clarity and efficiency in handling L2 fork requirements across various tests, impacting fees, bridges, and features. ([#18228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18228))
*   Support for building and utilizing a Kona prestate was added to dev stack tests, enhancing proof testing capabilities, including CircleCI configuration updates and new scripts for running the Kona host. ([#18144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18144), [#18230](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18230))
*   Outdated `DeployPreimageOracle` scripts were removed from `op-deployer` and `contracts-bedrock` packages, streamlining the deployment process. ([#18151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18151))

### Infrastructure Improvements
*   Zstandard (zstd) compression functionality was added to the `op-acceptor` component to improve data compression efficiency. ([#505](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/505))
