On November 10, 2025, Optimism's development focused on refining the `op-devstack` for L2 fork requirements and enhancing testing infrastructure with Kona prestate support within the `optimism` repository. Additionally, a new pull request was opened in `infra` to add zstd support to `op-acceptor`.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Devstack and Testing Infrastructure Enhancements
- The `op-devstack` was significantly refactored to improve how L2 forks are handled, clarifying and organizing fork requirements across various tests, impacting acceptance tests for fees, bridges, and features across network upgrades ([#18228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18228)).
- Support for building and utilizing a Kona prestate in dev stack tests was added, enhancing testing capabilities for proofs, including new CircleCI caching configurations and updates to `op-devstack` components to integrate the Kona client ([#18144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18144)).
- Several `DeployPreimageOracle` scripts were removed, streamlining the deployment process and reducing unnecessary code within `op-deployer` and `contracts-bedrock` ([#18151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18151)).
