On Oct 19, 2025, core development focused on refining the Fault Dispute Game contracts for improved flexibility and reduced redundancy, alongside significant activity in testing and build process improvements. Several issues related to `op-conductor` and `DisputeGameFactory` were resolved, while new discussions emerged regarding rollup configuration compatibility for zk stacks.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [ethereum-optimism/optimism#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17907): Discussion is ongoing regarding the impact of new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` on zk stacks and whether updating `op-succinct/kailua` is a viable alternative to adding a nullable system config. Input is needed to determine the best approach for compatibility.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Fault Dispute Game Contract Refinement
- The `FaultDisputeGameV2` contracts were updated to pass the game type as a `CWIA` argument instead of a constructor argument, allowing a single `FaultDisputeGame` deployment for both cannon and cannon-kona. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#17832](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17832))
