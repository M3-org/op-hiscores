On Oct 19, 2025, Optimism's development focused on refining fault dispute game contracts for enhanced flexibility, with a key change allowing a single `FaultDisputeGameV2` deployment to support multiple game types. Significant progress was also made in resolving sequencer startup issues and clarifying dispute game factory implementation restrictions, alongside active discussions on rollup configuration compatibility with zk stacks.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `ethereum-optimism/optimism` [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17907): Discussion is ongoing regarding new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` breaking zk stacks, with a question raised about the viability of updating `op-succinct/kailua` as an alternative to adding a nullable system config.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Fault Dispute Game Contract Enhancements
- The fault dispute game contracts were refined to pass the game type as a call-with-initial-arguments (CWIA) argument, enabling a single `FaultDisputeGameV2` deployment to support both cannon and cannon-kona game types, improving flexibility and reusability across `contracts-bedrock`. ([#17832](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17832))

## 🐞 Issue Triage
### New Issues
- **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:
    - [#17928](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17928): Avoid mocking in `opcm` test `test_addGameType_permissionedSuper_succeeds` by running `migrate` before adding super games.

### Closed Issues
- **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:
    - [#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17899): Resolved an issue where `op-conductor` failed to start the sequencer with a "no unsafe head" error after linking to a deployed sequencer.
    - [#17870](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17870): Closed an issue concerning the prevention of setting implementations for reserved game types in `DisputeGameFactory`, with the check being removed as `setImplementation` is intended to enforce that games cannot be created with reserved game types.
