Overall Project Summary:

Today, significant progress was made on documentation, including updates for the Jovian hard fork and new guides for chain operators, alongside critical fixes for retroactive reward calculations and SaferSafes security. A key focus of ongoing discussions across multiple repositories is the critical Go 1.25 compatibility issue for Cannon, which appears to be resolved in Go 1.25.4, and the synchronization of `op-batcher` with `op-node` rollup configurations.

## 🚨 Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [`ethereum-optimism/specs#18178`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18178): Discussion continues on how `op-batcher` should stay in sync with `op-node` rollup configurations, with proposals for operators to explicitly provide the config or for the batcher to reload it. Input is needed to decide on the best approach, considering trade-offs like new batcher releases for Superchain Registry config changes.
    - [`ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry#18178`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18178): Further discussion is needed on the `op-batcher`'s synchronization with `op-node` rollup configurations, specifically on the pragmatic solution of operators explicitly providing the config versus the need for new batcher releases.
    - [`ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding#18178`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18178): Input is required to finalize the strategy for `op-batcher` to stay in sync with `op-node` rollup configurations, weighing the benefits of explicit configuration against the release overhead.
    - [`ethereum-optimism/docs#18178`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18178): The team needs to decide on the best approach for `op-batcher` to synchronize with `op-node` rollup configurations, considering the discussed solutions and their implications.
    - [`ethereum-optimism/optimism#18178`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18178): A decision is needed on the `op-batcher` rollup config synchronization strategy, with a focus on whether operators should explicitly provide the config to avoid brittleness.
    - [`ethereum-optimism/design-docs#18178`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18178): The discussion around `op-batcher` synchronization with `op-node` rollup config requires a decision on the proposed solutions, such as explicit operator configuration or dynamic reloading.
