Today, Optimism saw significant progress in enhancing dispute game infrastructure with `op-challenger` now supporting optimistic ZK games and expanded withdrawal acceptance tests. Documentation was updated for batcher throttling, and CI processes were improved with an "approved" status for pending transactions. A recurring issue with `op deployer` reverting for custom intent parameters is under active discussion, and the audit for the Dispute Game Creator Pattern refactor is ongoing.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `op deployer` with Custom Intent Reverts ([ethereum-optimism/docs#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18407), [ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18407), [ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18407), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18407)): This issue, reported across multiple repositories, describes `op deployer` reverting when using custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values, likely due to a validation check in `FaultDisputeGame.sol` requiring `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` to be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration`.
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - Dispute Game Creator Pattern Refactor Audit ([ethereum-optimism/docs#17069](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17069), [ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops#17069](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17069), [ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry#17069](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17069), [ethereum-optimism/optimism#17069](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17069)): The audit is in progress as part of a general U18 audit, with a previous request for more detailed information in the audit scope section of the security readiness document.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Dispute Game & Withdrawal System Enhancements
- **Optimistic ZK Game Support in `op-challenger`**: The `op-challenger`'s `list-games` subcommand was updated to support optimistic ZK games, including initial build-out of OptimisticZK contract bindings, making the challenger more flexible. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18393))
- **Expanded Withdrawal Acceptance Tests**: New acceptance tests for withdrawals were added, triplicating existing tests to include PERMISSIONED, CANNON, and CANNON_KONA game types, ensuring comprehensive testing across various system configurations. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18374](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18374))
- **Enhanced Contract Testing and Fuzzing**: The `DevFeatures.t.sol` test file was improved with better naming conventions and fuzz tests for `isDevFeatureEnabled`, increasing test coverage and robustness. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18396](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18396))

### CI/CD & Workflow Improvements
- **CI Workflow Improvements**: A new "approved" status was added to the CI process to better handle scenarios where approvals are complete but execution is pending, preventing CI failures due to nonce changes without a transaction hash. ([ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops#1310](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1310))
- **CI/CD Improvements for Image Building**: An experimental GitHub Actions workflow was introduced to build and attest 16 Docker images from `docker-bake.hcl` using a secure, reusable workflow from the `factory` repository. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism#18397](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18397))

### Documentation & Integration Testing
- **Documentation Updates**: Documentation for batcher throttling was updated, including default values, to provide clearer guidance for chain operators. ([ethereum-optimism/docs#1889](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1889))
- **RevShare Integration Testing**: Extensive work was done to set up and test the `setupRevShare()` flow, including a new template for execution and integration/regression tests to verify the state on L2. ([ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops#1305](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1305))
