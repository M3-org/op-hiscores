On Oct 27, 2025, the Optimism project made significant strides in preparing for the Jovian hard fork with updates to precompile limits and activation timestamps across multiple configurations. A major cross-cutting achievement was the closure of the long-standing `op-deployer` end-to-end testing issue, thanks to the introduction of numerous new CLI-level integration tests, alongside substantial progress in documenting core L1 and L2 contracts and improving deployment tooling reliability.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Jovian Hard Fork Preparations & Superchain Updates
*   New precompile limits for the Jovian hard fork were introduced in `op-geth` to reflect more realistic limits on accelerated precompiles ([#709](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/709)).
*   Jovian activation timestamps were updated for 36 configuration files across Mainnet and Sepolia networks in `superchain-registry`, setting the activation time to November 25, 2025, 16:00:01 UTC ([#1130](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1130)).
*   Template assertions were improved in `superchain-ops` to ensure they revert on bad configurations, enhancing robustness and error handling ([#1259](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1259)).
*   ENSC was added to the Superchain Token List for Lisk and Lisk Sepolia in `ethereum-optimism.github.io`, including its symbol, decimals, and mainnet/Sepolia addresses ([#1223](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1223)).

### Documentation & Specification Enhancements
*   `op-acceptor` documentation was updated and path semantics refined within its runner module in `infra` ([#496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/496)).
*   Documentation related to L1 contract upgrades, including `op-deployer` upgrades and Superchain operations guides, was reorganized in `docs` to improve logical flow and accessibility ([#1809](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1809)).
*   New specifications were added in `specs` for critical L2 contracts like `OptimismMintableERC721Factory`, `OptimismMintableERC721`, and `L2ERC721Bridge` ([#833](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/833), [#832](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/832), [#831](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/831)).
*   A comprehensive specification for the `L1ERC721Bridge` was introduced in `specs`, detailing its role in enabling trustless ERC721 transfers ([#830](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/830)).
*   The `LivenessModule` and `DisputeGameFactory` also received new specifications in `specs`, outlining their functions within the OP Stack ([#828](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/828), [#829](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/829)).

### Testing & Deployment Tooling Improvements
*   CircleCI configuration in `infra` was switched to use blobless checkout, proactively addressing an upcoming platform change ([#497](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/497)).
*   `BaseFeeVault` test coverage and naming consistency were improved in `optimism` ([#17996](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17996)).
*   Go tests were migrated to regular runners in `optimism` for improved performance and efficiency ([#18032](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18032)).
*   Flakiness in `TestL2ELP2PCanonicalChainAdvancedByFCU` within acceptance tests was addressed in `optimism` ([#18029](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18029)).
*   A CI issue related to `op-e2e-fuzz` job dependency on `cannon-prestate` was fixed in `optimism` ([#18041](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18041)).
*   Error handling in `op-deployer`'s `add_game_type` CLI parsing was corrected in `optimism`, resolving an issue where it exited with an error message when no error occurred ([#18026](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18026)).
*   The legacy `DeployDisputeGame.s.sol` script was removed from `op-deployer` in `optimism` following refactoring ([#18002](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18002)).
*   Abandoned `DeployAuthSystem.s.sol` code was removed from `op-contracts` in `optimism` ([#18033](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18033)).
*   `DisputeGameFactoryHelper` in `op-e2e` was updated in `optimism` to use production contract bindings for VM fetching, supporting V1 and V2 contracts ([#18025](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18025)).
