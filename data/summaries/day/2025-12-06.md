Today, development focused on critical bug fixes for FFI builds and `op-acceptor` logging, alongside updates to acceptance tests. A significant amount of community engagement was observed, with multiple developers expressing interest in contributing to various open issues, particularly around `op-node` synchronization, `op-program` test failures, and code cleanup.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - `op-node` v1.16.3 synchronization issues ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18510), [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18510), [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18510), [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18510)): `geoknee` requested more detailed logs and metrics, including safe and unsafe heads, and recommended upgrading `op-geth` to v1.101603.5 to diagnose and resolve synchronization problems.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Build System & Infrastructure Improvements
- **FFI Build Stability**: A critical bug affecting FFI builds with blobless checkouts was resolved by reintroducing full checkouts, ensuring build stability and reliability in `ethereum-optimism/optimism`. ([#18527](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18527))
- **`op-acceptor` Logging & Stability**: Implemented a significant bug fix in `ethereum-optimism/infra` to enhance `op-acceptor`'s logging by streaming stdout directly to disk, reducing RAM usage, and introducing a signal handler for more graceful exits. ([#525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/525))
- **Acceptance Test Updates**: `op-acceptance-tests` were updated to `v3.8.0` of `op-acceptor`, improving testing infrastructure in `ethereum-optimism/optimism`. ([#18530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18530))
- **Log Management**: A chore was implemented in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` to delete acceptance testing logs older than 60 days to prevent disk space issues. ([#18529](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18529))
