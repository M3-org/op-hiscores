# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Feb 2 - 8, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, our focus was on strengthening the core protocol's reliability and long-term health. We resolved a critical bug to restore key functionality in our dispute game system and initiated a strategic discussion to overhaul the node synchronization process, aiming for a more robust and efficient design.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Enhancing Protocol Stability and Long-Term Reliability**
This work is fundamental to ensuring the network operates smoothly and remains resilient, providing a stable foundation for the entire Superchain ecosystem.
-   A critical operational issue was resolved in the `op-proposer`, restoring its ability to create transactions and ensuring the dispute game system functions as expected ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
-   We began planning a significant architectural improvement to the node synchronization process, proposing to replace the current mechanism with a simpler, more reliable alternative to solve persistent sync issues ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
Work this week centered on improving protocol stability through immediate fixes and long-term architectural planning.
-   Resolved a critical issue where `op-proposer` was failing to create transactions due to a misconfiguration, restoring key functionality for the dispute game system ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13502)).
-   Initiated a major architectural discussion to deprecate the `req-resp` P2P sync protocol in `op-node` ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14108)). The goal is to replace it with a simpler, more cost-effective mechanism to address ongoing sync problems and improve overall node stability.
