# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week was defined by a deep focus on protocol stability and security, as teams collaborated to investigate and diagnose several critical bugs across the OP Stack. While this crucial hardening work was the priority, progress was also made in preparing for future Superchain network upgrades and enhancing the fault proof system.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Hardening Protocol Security and Stability**
*To ensure the reliability of the core infrastructure, a significant effort was dedicated to identifying and addressing foundational bugs and improving node performance.*
- A critical bug was identified in `op-challenger` that causes it to fail when connected to older L1 nodes, and a fix is being prioritized to ensure compatibility across the ecosystem.
- Automated testing discovered a bug in the `OptimismPortal2` contract's deposit logic, allowing the team to proactively address a potential vulnerability.
- The `op-node`'s synchronization logic was improved in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), making it more resilient and reliable for node operators.
- Investigations are underway to resolve node synchronization failures and P2P connection instability, directly addressing issues reported by the community to improve the experience for all node operators.

**Advancing the Superchain and Fault Proof System**
*Work continued on expanding the Superchain and strengthening its security mechanisms, which are key to growing a secure and interoperable network of chains.*
- Upcoming hardforks were scheduled for Cyber and Funki Mainnets in [ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry), preparing them to activate new network features in early 2026.
- The fault proof testing environment was upgraded in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to align with modern network features, improving the quality of security testing.
- New development was initiated in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to add provable output roots to dispute games, a key step toward a more robust and secure fault proof system.

**Supporting Ecosystem Data and Tooling**
*To empower developers, analysts, and governance participants, we are focused on providing reliable data and maintaining high-quality documentation.*
- Work began in [ethereum-optimism/op-analytics](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics) to prepare data from past RetroPGF rounds, which will support valuable analysis of our public goods funding initiatives.
- New data integrity checks were added in [ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io) to ensure the accuracy of circulating supply information used by ecosystem dashboards and tools.
- Community-reported issues with documentation and tutorials were triaged in [ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs), helping maintain the quality of resources for builders.

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Coordinated Bug Investigation and Triage**
This week highlighted a major cross-team effort to ensure the stability and security of the entire OP Stack. Multiple teams collaborated to identify, diagnose, and prioritize several critical issues affecting core components. This shared effort across repositories like `optimism`, `docs`, and `op-analytics` ensured that high-priority bugs, such as a panic in `op-challenger` ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18608)) and a fuzzing failure in `OptimismPortal2` ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18554)), received immediate and focused attention from the right experts, accelerating the path to resolution.

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
The core development repository focused on strengthening the fault proof system and node reliability while initiating work on new security features.
- The Jovian hard fork was enabled for precompile fault proof tests ([#18606](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18606)), ensuring the test environment reflects modern network capabilities.
- The `op-node`'s light client was improved to more consistently follow its L1 source ([#18571](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18571)), enhancing synchronization stability.
- A critical bug was identified where `op-challenger` panics if the L1 client does not support blobs ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18608)), prompting discussions on a configuration fix.
- Work began on core filtering logic for `op-interop-filter` ([#18604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18604)) to advance Superchain interoperability.
- Development started on adding provable output roots to dispute games ([#18605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18605)), a significant enhancement for the fault proof system.

### ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry
This repository focused on preparing Superchain networks for future upgrades.
- The Fjord, Granite, and Holocene hardforks were scheduled for activation on Cyber Mainnet in early January 2026 ([#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1183)).
- The Granite and Holocene hardforks were scheduled for activation on Funki Mainnet in early January 2026 ([#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1182)).
- The `standard-prestates.toml` configuration was updated to include Kona version 1.2.7 ([#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1184)), keeping the registry aligned with the latest releases.

### ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io
Work in this repository focused on improving the reliability of data consumed by ecosystem tools.
- A new test was added to validate the circulating supply data file ([#1247](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1247)), preventing potential data corruption in dashboards and other tools.

### op-analytics
The analytics repository focused on preparing data for public goods funding analysis.
- A new pull request was opened to add CSV data dumps for RetroPGF Seasons 7 and 8 ([#1774](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1774)), which will enable deeper insights into funding outcomes.

### docs
While no code was merged, the documentation repository was active in triaging community feedback and tracking critical stack-wide issues.
- New issues were opened to address a broken link in the governance FAQ ([#1918](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1918)) and a failing developer tutorial ([#1919](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1919)), demonstrating a responsive feedback loop with the community.
