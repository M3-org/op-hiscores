# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, the team paused active code development to concentrate on strategic planning and prioritization. This focus resulted in a clear decision to maintain momentum on core initiatives by evaluating and deprioritizing a proposed enhancement to the developer environment.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes
**Maintaining Strategic Focus on Core Priorities**
To ensure development resources are consistently applied to the most critical roadmap items, the team actively evaluates new proposals against current project goals.
-   In the [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) repository, a proposal to add flashblocks support to the developer testnet was discussed and ultimately deprioritized, reinforcing the team's commitment to its primary objectives.

## Repository Spotlights
### ethereum-optimism/optimism
Development activity was paused this week in favor of strategic planning, with discussion centered on a single proposal.
-   A proposal to enhance the Kurtosis devnet by adding flashblocks support was introduced for discussion in issue [#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16514).
-   After evaluation, the team concluded that this work is currently a low priority and will not be implemented, allowing development to remain focused on other initiatives.
