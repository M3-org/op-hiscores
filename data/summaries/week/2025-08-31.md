# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, the project made significant strides on two fronts: clearing historical technical debt by closing numerous long-standing issues, and laying the groundwork for the next generation of fault proofs with extensive planning for the "Kona + Cannon" upgrade. This dual effort enhances current stability while accelerating progress toward future protocol milestones.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Preparing for Next-Generation Fault Proofs**
*This work is critical for advancing the security and decentralization of the OP Stack and the Superchain.*
-   Extensive planning and coordination occurred across multiple teams to define the requirements for integrating the new "Kona + Cannon" fault proof system. This involved specifying changes to the dispute monitor, contract manager, and prestate tooling ([design-docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs), [superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops), [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth)).
-   Initial design work began for an "aggregate dispute game," representing the next step in fault proof innovation ([optimism#17305](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17305)).

**Strengthening Engineering Foundations and Developer Velocity**
*Improving our internal tools and testing frameworks allows us to build and ship higher-quality features more quickly and reliably.*
-   A major overhaul of the testing infrastructure was completed, unifying acceptance tests into a single workflow and migrating them to a more robust environment ([optimism#16755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16755)).
-   CI regression tests were made 40% faster, significantly speeding up the development feedback loop ([superchain-ops#1178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1178)).
-   Standardized tool versioning was introduced to ensure all developers work with a consistent environment, reducing setup friction ([infra#452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/452)).
-   A large volume of historical issues related to past initiatives like Drippie and Cannon were closed, clearing technical debt and focusing the team on current priorities ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).

**Enhancing the Superchain Ecosystem and Network Stability**
*Growing the ecosystem and ensuring the core protocol is stable are essential for attracting users, developers, and new chains to the Superchain.*
-   The Superchain Token List was expanded with four new tokens (ARCv2, MITY, CIOTX, FORT), increasing asset availability on networks like Base ([ethereum-optimism.github.io](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io)).
-   A critical bug affecting L1 ownership transfers for Worldchain was resolved, restoring key functionality ([superchain-ops#1176](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1176)).
-   `op-geth` was synchronized with the latest `go-ethereum v1.16.2` release, ensuring it benefits from upstream improvements and security updates ([op-geth#663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/663)).
-   A design for a critical Superchain upgrade fix was completed, enhancing protocol security ([design-docs#310](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/310)).

**Advancing Public Goods Funding and Community Tooling**
*Building sustainable mechanisms for funding public goods and providing value to the community are core to our mission.*
-   Work began on a more generic, season-agnostic framework for Retro Public Goods Funding calculations, starting with the scaffold for Season 8 ([Retro-Funding#74](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/74)).
-   A major initiative was launched to modernize the Optimism marketing site with a new tech stack, aiming to improve our web presence ([ecosystem#937](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/937)).
-   New analytical outputs were generated for five OP Chains, providing deeper insights into network activity ([op-analytics#1740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1740)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Kona + Cannon Fault Proof Integration**
-   **Goal:** To prepare the entire OP Stack for a major upcoming protocol upgrade that introduces a new fault proof system.
-   **Coordination:** This week saw intensive, cross-repository discussions to define the technical requirements for this upgrade. Teams working on `op-geth`, `design-docs`, `superchain-ops`, `infra`, and other core repositories collaborated to scope out necessary changes to components like the Optimism Portal Contract Manager (OPCM), the dispute monitor (`op-dispute-mon`), and prestate management tooling. This coordinated planning ensures that all parts of the system will be ready for the new `cannon-kona` game type, preventing integration issues and ensuring a smooth rollout.
