# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week was focused on laying the groundwork for future enhancements across the OP Stack and improving the developer experience. While no major features were shipped, significant new work was initiated to advance core protocol capabilities like custom gas tokens, enhance essential developer tooling, and begin planning for a more robust documentation and website infrastructure.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Advancing Core Protocol Capabilities**
To expand the flexibility and security of the OP Stack for all chains in the Superchain, we began work on key new features.
-   Work commenced to introduce support for custom gas tokens, a feature that will give Superchain chains more flexibility in their economic models ([specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs)).
-   Integration began for `FaultDisputeGameV2`, a new version of the fault dispute game designed to strengthen the protocol's security and decentralization ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).

**Improving the Developer and Contributor Experience**
To make it easier for builders to create on Optimism and for contributors to improve the stack, we focused on reducing friction and accelerating development.
-   A redesign of the documentation homepage was proposed to create a more intuitive and welcoming entry point for new developers ([docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs)).
-   Several enhancements were planned for the `op-up` developer tool to make it more user-friendly and help gather feedback for future improvements ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
-   Developer friction caused by a complex CI/CD pipeline was formally documented as a priority for improvement, demonstrating a commitment to acting on internal feedback ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).

**Strengthening Foundational Infrastructure**
To ensure the long-term health, maintainability, and reliability of our systems, we initiated several foundational and planning efforts.
-   A research project was kicked off to plan a new Content Management System (CMS) architecture for the main `optimism.io` website, paving the way for a more scalable web presence ([ecosystem](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem)).
-   Work began on refactoring internal test runners to improve the quality and maintainability of our testing infrastructure ([infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra)).
-   Efforts to automate documentation build workflows were started, aiming to streamline the process for contributors ([docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Diagnosing CI and Testing Gaps**
This week saw a coordinated effort to diagnose an issue where logs for failed acceptance tests were not being captured, which hindered debugging.
-   Contributors across the `docs`, `optimism`, `specs`, and `op-analytics` repositories investigated the problem ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17151)). The root cause was identified: the current workflow was not designed to capture these specific logs. This collaborative diagnosis provided clarity that ongoing work to restructure the tests is expected to resolve the issue, establishing a clear path forward.

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
The core repository focused on initiating new protocol work and identifying key areas to improve the developer experience.
-   Work began on integrating `FaultDisputeGameV2` into the Dispute Game Factory, a key step in advancing the protocol's fault-proof system ([#17119](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17119)).
-   A series of issues were created to enhance the `op-up` developer tool, including adding usage metrics ([#17164](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17164)), a startup message ([#17134](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17134)), and a survey link ([#17135](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17135)).
-   Based on feedback from a team retrospective, an issue was created to formally address developer friction caused by the large and complex CircleCI configuration ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17184)).
-   An investigation was launched into missing logs in acceptance tests to improve debugging and test reliability ([#17150](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17150)).

### ethereum-optimism/docs
Activity centered on improving the documentation's user experience and internal development processes.
-   A proposal to redesign the documentation homepage was opened to enhance the initial experience for developers and community members ([#1718](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1718)).
-   To streamline the build process, a pull request was introduced to automate npm and Gulp tasks within the CI/CD pipeline ([#1720](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1720)).
-   A discussion on missing test logs ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17151)) progressed significantly, with contributors clarifying the root cause and pointing to a resolution in another repository.

### ethereum-optimism/specs
Development began on a significant new feature for the OP Stack aimed at increasing flexibility for Superchain ecosystems.
-   A new pull request was opened to begin adding support for custom gas tokens, marking the start of a key development effort ([#749](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/749)).

### ethereum-optimism/infra
This week's focus was on internal code quality and maintainability.
-   An effort to improve the codebase was initiated with a pull request to refactor the test runner within the `op-acceptor` component ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/448)).

### ethereum-optimism/ecosystem
Work this week was focused on future planning for the project's main web presence.
-   A new issue was created to "spike the CMS architecture for optimism.io," kicking off the initial investigation for a future overhaul of the website's content management system ([#930](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/930)).

### ethereum-optimism/op-analytics
Activity was minimal, focused on code maintenance and clarifying an existing issue.
-   A pull request was opened for minor code cleanup to remove redundant words from the codebase ([#1726](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1726)).
-   Important context was provided on an issue regarding missing test logs ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17151)), clarifying that a planned test migration is expected to resolve the problem.

### ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry
Activity was minimal, with a single new contribution initiated.
-   A new pull request was opened to address Celo-sepolia, indicating the start of new integration work ([#1099](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1099)).
