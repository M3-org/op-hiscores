# Overall Project Weekly Summary (May 25 - 31, 2025)

## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
This week was dedicated to foundational improvements within the OP Stack. Efforts were concentrated on enhancing core system components, laying the groundwork for future stability and more efficient development. While no new features were released, this internal work is critical for the long-term health of the ecosystem.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Strengthening the Foundation of the OP Stack**
This initiative focuses on improving the internal architecture of our core technology to ensure long-term stability, security, and ease of maintenance.
-   Work began on enhancing the `op-supervisor`, a key component for monitoring system health. This effort in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) aims to create a more robust framework for managing how different parts of the system depend on one another.
