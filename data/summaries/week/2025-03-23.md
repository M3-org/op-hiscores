# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Mar 23 - 29, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, we focused on improving the developer experience for new teams building on the OP Stack, a key part of our strategy to grow the Superchain ecosystem. Acting on direct community feedback, we began addressing critical gaps in our documentation for setting up new chains, which also surfaced important insights into the operational costs of our deployment tools.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Improving the Developer Experience for Superchain Builders**
To grow a vibrant network of interoperable chains, we must provide clear, accessible tools and documentation for new builders.
-   Work began to overhaul outdated documentation for setting up a testnet, which was identified as a significant blocker for new teams joining the Superchain ecosystem in [ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs).
-   Based on valuable community feedback, we uncovered that our current deployment tooling may lead to high operational costs for chain operators, prompting a deeper technical review in [ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs).

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/docs
The `docs` repository was the center of activity this week, focusing on improving the onboarding path for external chain operators.
-   A new issue was opened to create clear, updated documentation for setting up a rollup testnet using the `op-deployer` tool ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1530)), as the current guides were identified as a blocker for developers.
-   Community discussion on this issue provided valuable real-world feedback, highlighting that the current fault-proof system implementation may cause a high number of RPC calls, increasing operational costs for node operators.
-   An in-progress pull request aims to begin clarifying the deployment process for OP Stack rollups ([#1539](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1539)).
