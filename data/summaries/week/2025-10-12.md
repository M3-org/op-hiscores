# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, the project made significant strides on two parallel fronts: advancing the upcoming Jovian network upgrade with key feature implementations, while simultaneously hardening the protocol's security and stability through critical bug fixes and infrastructure improvements. This dual focus ensures both future growth and current reliability for the Superchain ecosystem.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Preparing for the Jovian Network Upgrade**
_Strategic Importance: This work lays the foundation for the next major evolution of the OP Stack, introducing new capabilities for data handling and economic incentives._
-   A consensus-breaking change to the operator fee formula was merged, designed to increase its utility ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
-   The technical specifications for the Data Availability (DA) footprint limit were finalized, defining how the network will account for blob data gas costs ([ethereum-optimism/specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs)).
-   Implementation and testing for the DA footprint limit were completed across the stack, moving this core Jovian feature closer to release ([ethereum-optimism/op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth), [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).

**Enhancing Protocol Security and Network Stability**
_Strategic Importance: A secure and reliable network is the bedrock of user trust and is essential for the long-term health of the ecosystem._
-   A critical bug affecting snap-sync for some chains was fixed, ensuring nodes can sync correctly and reliably ([ethereum-optimism/op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth)).
-   The dispute monitor was made more resilient by improving its ability to correctly identify out-of-sync nodes, preventing false alarms and strengthening security ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
-   A massive effort was undertaken to improve automated testing, fixing numerous flaky tests to ensure the continuous integration pipeline is stable and reliable ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
-   Stability issues with the Flashblocks proxy service were resolved, improving connectivity and preventing lost blocks ([ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops), [ethereum-optimism/community-hub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub)).

**Growing the Superchain Ecosystem**
_Strategic Importance: Expanding the diversity of assets and capabilities on the Superchain makes the ecosystem more vibrant and useful for everyone._
-   Several new tokens, including ATTN, MIRROR, DSTRX, and RIO, were added to the Superchain token list, broadening the range of on-chain assets ([ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io)).
-   A new design document was introduced for on-chain revenue sharing, outlining a path to enshrine fee-splitting mechanisms within the OP Stack ([ethereum-optimism/design-docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs)).
-   A detailed architecture document for the `kona-node`, a new rollup node implementation, was added, paving the way for future client diversity ([ethereum-optimism/design-docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs)).

**Improving Developer and Operator Tooling**
_Strategic Importance: Providing clear documentation and robust tools empowers developers to build and operators to maintain the network, fostering decentralization and innovation._
-   A major initiative began to restructure the project's documentation, aiming to improve its information architecture and clarity for builders ([ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs)).
-   CI error messages were improved to provide more actionable feedback, making it easier for developers to debug chain configuration issues ([ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry)).
-   A bug was fixed in the `op-conductor-ops` tool to ensure correct voter assignments, improving the reliability of sequencer management ([ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

-   **Data Availability (DA) Footprint Limit**: This key Jovian upgrade feature required coordinated work across multiple repositories. The effort began in `ethereum-optimism/specs` to define the new gas mechanism, followed by implementation in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` and `ethereum-optimism/op-geth`, and was validated through extensive testing tracked in `ethereum-optimism/infra` and `ethereum-optimism/docs`.
-   **Dispute System Reliability**: A project-wide discussion on improving the `op-dispute-mon`'s ability to handle out-of-sync nodes took place across nearly all repositories. This led to a concrete fix in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` that makes the monitoring service more robust, preventing false alarms and strengthening network security.
-   **Flashblocks Stability**: A critical issue causing lost blocks was resolved through a coordinated effort. The fix involved upgrades to the proxy service tracked in `ethereum-optimism/community-hub` and `ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops`, and required successful coordination with external RPC providers to roll out the changes.
