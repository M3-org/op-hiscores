# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Mar 30 - 5, 2025)

## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
This week, our efforts were concentrated on reinforcing the security and integrity of the OP Stack. Through a proactive collaboration with external security auditors, we identified and began analyzing a potential vulnerability, underscoring our commitment to maintaining a robust and trustworthy protocol for the entire Superchain.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes
**Strengthening Protocol Security and Integrity**
_Strategic Importance: Ensuring the core protocol is secure and resilient is our highest priority, as it forms the foundation for the entire Optimism ecosystem and the broader Superchain._
-   Through an external security audit conducted by Spearbit, we proactively identified a potential vulnerability in the core protocol's state transition logic, allowing our team to begin analysis immediately. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism))
-   Discussions to address the finding are underway, focusing on strengthening the protocol's validation checks to enhance its overall resilience against potential exploits. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism))

## Repository Spotlights
### ethereum-optimism/optimism
This week's activity was centered on security analysis rather than new feature development, with no new code merged.
-   Following a security audit by Spearbit, a critical issue was opened to track a potential vulnerability in the `op-program` state transition logic: [#15217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15217).
-   The team has confirmed the validity of the finding and is actively discussing a fix to strengthen the protocol's validation rules.
