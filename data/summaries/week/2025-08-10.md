# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Aug 10 - 16, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week was dedicated to strategic planning and foundational work for future protocol upgrades, with no major code changes merged. The team focused on scoping out significant initiatives like the Data Availability (DA) Footprint Limit for the upcoming Jovian release and held cross-cutting discussions on potential architectural simplifications, such as the removal of the event system.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Planning for Future Protocol Upgrades**
*To enhance the scalability, security, and efficiency of the OP Stack, significant effort was invested in defining the next wave of protocol enhancements.*
-   Extensive planning was initiated for the **Data Availability (DA) Footprint Limit**, a key feature for the upcoming Jovian release. This involved creating detailed planning issues in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), drafting the initial specification in [ethereum-optimism/specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs), and preparing for its documentation in [ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs).
-   The scope of the in-progress `min-base-fee` feature was refined, separating complex analysis from the core specification to streamline its development, as noted in [ethereum-optimism/specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs).

**Improving Developer Tooling and Stability**
*To make it easier and more reliable for developers to build on Optimism, we are continuously improving our tools and testing infrastructure.*
-   Work began to improve the local development experience by proposing the addition of local `op-geth` images for easier testing in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).
-   A proposal was made to make automated test scripts more resilient to intermittent failures, ensuring a more stable development environment in [ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops).
-   Planning began to expand test coverage for the local development stack, ensuring higher reliability for builders in [ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra).

**Expanding the Superchain Ecosystem**
*To grow the network of interoperable chains and assets, we continue to welcome new projects into the ecosystem.*
-   Proposals were submitted to add several new tokens (ARCv2, MITY, and $PAGE) to the Superchain and Base network lists, reflecting continued community growth in [ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io).

### Cross-Repository Coordination
This week highlighted strong coordination on forward-looking initiatives that span multiple parts of the project.

-   **Scoping the Data Availability (DA) Footprint Limit:** A coordinated effort began to define a key feature for the Jovian release that will manage data usage. This involved creating detailed planning issues in `optimism`, drafting the initial specification in `specs`, and preparing for documentation in `docs`.
-   **Refining Core Protocol Specifications:** To clarify complex features, the `min-base-fee` discussion led to a decision to separate state growth analysis from the core protocol specification. This coordination between `specs` and `ethereum-optimism.github.io` ensures that specifications remain focused while detailed analysis is tracked in dedicated design documents.
-   **Discussing Major Architectural Changes:** A significant, cross-cutting discussion about potentially removing the entire event system took place across the `optimism`, `docs`, `superchain-ops`, and `ethereum-optimism.github.io` repositories. This signals a collaborative evaluation of a major architectural simplification for long-term maintainability.

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
The primary focus was on extensive planning for future work rather than merging new code.
-   A major planning effort was initiated for the **Data Availability (DA) Footprint Limit**, with a suite of new issues created for planning ([#16998](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16998)), design ([#17009](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17009)), and specification ([#17087](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17087)).
-   Discussions on future protocol evolution continued with new issues for an "Aggregate Dispute Game" ([#17013](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17013)) and adding support for Go 1.24 in Cannon ([#17095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17095)).
-   A significant architectural discussion in [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16874) revealed that the team is considering removing the entire event system to simplify the architecture.
-   To improve the developer experience, a pull request was opened to add local `op-geth` images for Kurtosis testing ([#17030](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17030)).

### ethereum-optimism/specs
Activity centered on refining in-progress specifications and initiating work on new features for the Jovian release.
-   Work began on data availability specifications for the Jovian upgrade with a new pull request for the "DA Footprint" ([#748](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/748)).
-   Following discussion on the `min-base-fee` specification ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/742)), a decision was made to move the state growth analysis to a separate design document ([design-docs#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/316)) to keep the core spec focused.

### ethereum-optimism/docs
This week was focused on strategic planning and unblocking future documentation efforts.
-   The effort to add Go 1.24 support for Cannon was elevated to an "epic" ([#14760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/14760)), signaling a significant, structured initiative.
-   A key discussion in [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16874) highlighted the potential deprecation of the entire event system, a major architectural consideration.
-   Progress was made on the DA Footprint Limit documentation by providing links to the core design document and specification ([#17009](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17009), [#17087](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17087)).

### ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io
The repository saw continued proposals for ecosystem growth and discussions on protocol specifications.
-   Several pull requests were opened to expand the Superchain ecosystem by adding new tokens: ARCv2 ([#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1184)), MITY ([#1185](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1185)), and $PAGE ([#1186](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1186)).
-   Discussion on the `min-base-fee` feature ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/742)) led to a re-scoping of the work, clarifying its implementation path.
