# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week was marked by a dual focus on solidifying the OP Stack for future growth and responding to a critical, emergent network health issue. We made significant progress in maturing the protocol by finalizing the scope of the Jovian upgrade and making features like Cannon-Kona standard. Simultaneously, the team mobilized a cross-functional effort to diagnose and address a widespread node synchronization issue affecting operators across the Superchain.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Responding to Critical Node Instability**
_Goal: To ensure the reliability and stability of the Superchain by rapidly diagnosing and resolving issues that impact node operators._
- A new, high-priority node synchronization failure emerged, causing "missing trie node" errors for operators on multiple chains including Optimism, Base, and Unichain. This issue is being actively investigated across numerous repositories, including [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth), and [infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra), to identify the root cause and restore normal operations ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18581)).
- An older node synchronization failure was successfully resolved after the community, guided by maintainers, confirmed that upgrading and resyncing the `op-geth` client fixed the problem ([superchain-ops#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18510)).

**Maturing the OP Stack for Future Upgrades**
_Goal: To streamline the core protocol by removing temporary feature flags and finalizing upgrade specifications, making the system more robust and easier to maintain._
- The protocol was significantly simplified by removing feature toggles for the Jovian upgrade, Cannon-Kona, and DisputeGame-V2, making these advanced features a standard part of the OP Stack ([optimism#17978](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17978), [optimism#18208](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18208), [optimism#18588](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18588)).
- The scope for the Jovian hard fork was officially locked in by removing related feature toggles and adding enhanced tests for new precompile limits, marking a key milestone in its release cycle ([op-geth#703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/703), [op-geth#731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/731)).

**Enhancing the Developer and Node Operator Experience**
_Goal: To make it easier for developers and node operators to build on and interact with the OP Stack through clearer documentation and more powerful tools._
- The documentation for node operators underwent a major overhaul, with configuration guides refactored for clarity and JSON-RPC information split into client-specific pages ([docs#1916](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1916), [docs#1905](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1905)).
- Comprehensive documentation for the `op-deployer` tool was ported to the main documentation site, providing a central resource for its installation, usage, and architecture ([docs#1911](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1911)).
- The `op-deployer` tool itself was updated to support the upcoming `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrade, improving deployment capabilities for the next generation of contracts ([optimism#18580](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18580)).

**Expanding and Maintaining the Superchain**
_Goal: To grow the Superchain ecosystem by adding new chains and continuously improving the underlying infrastructure and test environments._
- The Superchain ecosystem expanded with the official addition of Celo Sepolia to the registry, complete with its configuration files and chain lists ([superchain-registry#1116](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1116)).
- The Soneium Minato Testnet was enhanced to support permissionless fault proofs, a critical step in testing and validating the next evolution of the protocol's security model ([superchain-ops#1317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1317)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

- **Diagnosing Node Synchronization Failures:** The week's most significant coordinated effort was the investigation into the node sync issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18581)). The problem was reported and discussed across `op-geth`, `optimism`, `docs`, `infra`, `superchain-registry`, `op-analytics`, and `design-docs`, demonstrating a project-wide response to a critical infrastructure challenge.
- **Finalizing the Jovian Upgrade:** Preparing for the Jovian hard fork required synchronized work between repositories. The `op-geth` team locked in the scope ([#703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/703)), while the `optimism` team removed the corresponding feature toggles from the stack ([#17978](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17978)), ensuring a consistent and stable upgrade path.
- **Improving Tooling Documentation:** To improve the developer experience, documentation for the `op-deployer` tool was moved from the `optimism` monorepo to the central `docs` site ([#1911](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1911)), ensuring that tooling and its documentation evolve in lockstep.
