# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, Optimism made significant strides on two parallel fronts: executing near-term protocol upgrades and hardening core infrastructure for long-term stability. The U17 Jovian Upgrade was successfully deployed to test networks, while project-wide discussions focused on solving foundational challenges related to transaction batching and data consistency, ensuring the Superchain remains robust and efficient as it grows.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Advancing the Protocol Roadmap**
_Goal: To deliver planned network upgrades that enhance the capabilities and security of the OP Stack for all Superchain participants._
- The U17 Jovian Upgrade was successfully deployed to test networks, a key milestone on the path to mainnet activation. This was supported by a critical bug fix to ensure the upgrade transaction could execute smoothly. ([superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops))
- Preparations for future upgrades continued, with timestamps set for the upcoming Fusaka, BPO1, and BPO2 mainnet upgrades. ([op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth))
- Foundational work for the next-generation Cannon-Kona fault proof system progressed across contracts and tooling, paving the way for its future integration. ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism))

**Hardening Core Infrastructure for Long-Term Stability**
_Goal: To improve the security, reliability, and efficiency of the fundamental components that power the Superchain._
- Network security was enhanced by restricting transaction mempool access to trusted peers, reducing the surface area for spam attacks. ([op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth))
- A critical relayer failure affecting the Lisk chain was resolved, restoring cross-chain messaging and ensuring reliable interoperability within the Superchain. ([ecosystem](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem))
- A rare but critical database corruption bug was fixed, improving data integrity for node operators. ([op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth))
- Monitoring capabilities were improved with new metrics to track RPC endpoint errors, giving operators better visibility into system health. ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism))

**Improving Developer Experience and Ecosystem Growth**
_Goal: To empower builders and grow the ecosystem by providing clear documentation, diverse assets, and support for public goods._
- A massive documentation initiative was undertaken, with widespread quality improvements, new technical specifications, and crucial new guides for chain operators. ([docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs), [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs))
- The variety of assets available on the Superchain expanded with the addition of several new tokens, including SYND, VEE, eUSD, POLS, and rETH, across Base and other networks. ([ethereum-optimism.github.io](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io))
- Preparations for the next round of public goods funding advanced with the addition of draft results for RetroPGF Round 8, Milestone 9, which are now ready for quality assurance. ([Retro-Funding](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding))

### Cross-Repository Coordination

This week highlighted a project-wide focus on solving complex architectural challenges that span multiple components of the OP Stack.
- **Core Service Reliability:** Discussions occurred across nearly every repository to design solutions for two critical issues. The first is a `proxyd` "time travel" bug ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/501)) where services can report outdated information. The second involves improving the `op-batcher`'s efficiency during network congestion ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102)) and making its configuration less brittle ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18178)). This coordinated brainstorming ensures that solutions are robust and consider the needs of the entire system.
- **Documentation Overhaul:** A concerted effort to improve documentation quality was visible across multiple repositories. This included a large-scale quality pass in the `docs` repo, the introduction of new formal specifications in `specs`, and the start of a new documentation initiative in the `optimism` repo, demonstrating a shared commitment to improving resources for developers and operators.
