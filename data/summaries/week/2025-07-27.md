# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week was dedicated to laying the groundwork for significant future enhancements to the OP Stack, with a primary focus on initiating a major protocol upgrade for a configurable minimum base fee. While no major features were merged, extensive planning and cross-team collaboration took place to advance the protocol's economic stability, improve Superchain reliability, and refine developer tooling.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Enhancing the Protocol's Economic Model**
_Goal: To introduce more dynamic and stable fee management for chains built on the OP Stack, improving the network's economic sustainability._
-   Work began on implementing a configurable minimum base fee, a key feature that will allow for better control over network transaction costs. Foundational pull requests were opened in both the core [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) and [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth) repositories.
-   The technical requirements for this new fee mechanism were defined through new issues, detailing necessary changes to block headers and smart contracts to support the feature.
-   The formal specification for the feature was advanced in [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs) and [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry), including a request to analyze its potential impact on network state growth.

**Strengthening Superchain Reliability and Infrastructure**
_Goal: To ensure the network remains stable, secure, and easy for operators to manage as the Superchain ecosystem grows._
-   Proposals were made in the [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) repository to add new monitoring and alerts for sequencers, which will improve operational visibility and response times.
-   In response to feedback from the Base team, work was initiated to address transaction propagation issues ("mempool drift"), showcasing effective problem-solving across the Superchain.
-   A fix was proposed to improve how network configurations are managed and upgraded, making the system more robust for all chains on the Superchain.

**Improving the Developer Experience**
_Goal: To make it easier for developers to build on, contribute to, and maintain the OP Stack through clear documentation and reliable tools._
-   An update to the L2 rollup testnet tutorial was submitted in the [docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs) repository to keep developer guides current.
-   A fix was proposed for a developer-facing game template in [superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops), ensuring our example code remains correct and useful.

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Coordinated Kickoff for Minimum Base Fee Feature**
A major initiative this week was the coordinated effort to design and implement a configurable minimum base fee. This feature requires changes across the entire stack, from the client ([op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth)) to the node software ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)) and the formal specifications ([specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs), [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry)). A central tracking issue ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16807)) is being used to synchronize work, and collaboration extended to the wider ecosystem with the sharing of a draft implementation from the `reth` team for early feedback.

**Superchain Ecosystem Collaboration**
The value of the Superchain's collaborative model was demonstrated this week. An issue regarding mempool drift, first observed by the Base team, was formally addressed in the [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) repository ([#16932](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16932)). This highlights how operational insights from one chain can lead to infrastructure improvements that benefit the entire ecosystem.

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
-   **Minimum Base Fee:** A pull request ([#16852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16852)) was opened to begin implementation of the configurable minimum base fee, and a related issue ([#16839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16839)) was created to define the necessary smart contract changes.
-   **Sequencer Reliability:** New issues were opened to propose adding alerts for sequencer status ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16867)) and peer health ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16868)), improving operational monitoring.
-   **Mempool Stability:** An issue ([#16932](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16932)) was created to address mempool drift by deploying a rebroadcaster, based on observations from the Base team.
-   **Superchain Configuration:** A fix was proposed to address issues with `superchainConfig` upgrades and enable support for multiple configuration instances ([#16838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16838)).
-   **Node Architecture:** Initial work began on execution multiplexing for `op-node` and `op-devstack` ([#16873](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16873)) to improve node architecture.

### ethereum-optimism/op-geth
-   **Minimum Base Fee Implementation:** Foundational work began with a new pull request ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/648)) to introduce the configurable minimum base fee.
-   **Protocol Scoping:** Two new issues were created to scope the feature: one to add `minBaseFee` to the block header ([#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/649)) and another to add it to payload attributes ([#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/650)).

### ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops
-   **Developer Tooling:** A pull request ([#1157](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1157)) was opened to fix an issue in the respected game template.
-   **Min Base Fee Coordination:** Active discussions on the feature's tracking issue ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16807)) included sharing a `reth` draft for review and coordinating work across other repositories.
