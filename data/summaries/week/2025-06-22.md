# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This was a quiet week focused on planning for future development across the Optimism ecosystem. While active code contributions were paused, strategic groundwork was laid for a new mini-app feature, signaling preparation for the next cycle of work.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes
**Laying the Groundwork for New Ecosystem Applications**
To grow the Superchain, we are continuously planning new tools and applications that enhance user and developer capabilities.
-   Planning began for a new mini-app feature, with initial work focused on defining the process for deploying a claim contract. This was tracked in the [ethereum-optimism/ecosystem](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem) repository.

## Repository Spotlights
### ethereum-optimism/ecosystem
Activity in this repository was focused on planning for upcoming development rather than active coding.
-   A new issue was created to outline the implementation of a claim contract deployment process for a mini app, setting the stage for future work ([#868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/868)).
