# Overall Project Weekly Summary (May 4 - 10, 2025)

## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
This week, the team focused on critical planning and organizational work for the next phase of the Fault Proof system. While no new code was merged, significant progress was made in structuring upcoming development efforts, ensuring a clear and efficient path forward for this core security feature.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Preparing for a More Secure and Decentralized Network**
This initiative focuses on enhancing the Fault Proof system, a cornerstone of Optimism's security model that allows anyone to challenge and correct invalid state transitions, ensuring the integrity of the chain.
-   Project management for the Fault Proof system was streamlined by consolidating related tasks under a single tracker, improving focus and efficiency for the development team in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).
-   Planning was initiated to investigate necessary upgrades for the Fault Proof creator contract, a key component for deploying and managing fault proofs on the network, as detailed in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
Work in the core protocol repository was centered on organizing the development roadmap for the Fault Proof system. This preparatory work is crucial for ensuring the security and decentralization of the protocol.
-   Efforts for the new Creator Pattern were consolidated by closing a sub-issue ([#13168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13168)) to centralize tracking under the main parent issue ([#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421)), improving project organization.
-   A new investigation was opened ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15789)) to define necessary changes for the Fault Proof creator contract, laying the groundwork for future development in this critical area.
