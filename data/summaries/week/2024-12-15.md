A critical configuration issue preventing users from proposing state roots was collaboratively diagnosed and resolved, ensuring builders can continue to operate effectively on the OP Stack.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes
**Ensuring Builder Success Through Responsive Community Support**
_Strategic Importance: The health of the Superchain ecosystem depends on developers being able to build and deploy successfully; providing rapid, collaborative support is crucial for unblocking them._
-   A critical issue preventing the `op-proposer` from functioning was identified and resolved through community collaboration in the [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) repository. This effort unblocked developers who were unable to propose new state roots, a core function for OP Chains.

## Repository Spotlights
### ethereum-optimism/optimism
The week's activity was focused on community support rather than new code contributions, with no new pull requests merged.
-   A significant new issue was raised regarding the `op-proposer` failing to create transactions due to a configuration error. Community members quickly collaborated to diagnose the problem, tracing it to an incorrect dispute game type setting ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13502)).
-   The resolution, which involves updating contract implementations and using the correct configuration flags, was confirmed by users, demonstrating effective, real-time troubleshooting.
