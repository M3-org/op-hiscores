# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Apr 13 - 19, 2025)

## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
This week was focused on strengthening the foundational health and long-term stability of the Optimism ecosystem. While no new features were released, crucial maintenance was performed to enhance infrastructure security, and strategic planning was initiated to improve the maintainability of the Superchain registry. This foundational work ensures the platform remains secure, reliable, and prepared for future growth.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Investing in Long-Term Stability and Security**
*This initiative focuses on the essential, behind-the-scenes work required to ensure the OP Stack and Superchain are secure, reliable, and easy to manage as the ecosystem expands.*
-   Core infrastructure components were proactively updated to incorporate the latest security patches, reinforcing the stability of the entire network. This work was completed in [ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra).
-   Planning began to streamline how network configurations are managed within the Superchain, aiming to reduce errors and make the registry more accurate and easier to maintain for all participants. This was driven by [ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry).

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/infra
Activity this week centered on proactive maintenance to bolster the security and stability of Optimism's infrastructure.
-   Core Go module dependencies were updated across several services to patch potential security vulnerabilities, including `golang.org/x/crypto` ([#281](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/281), [#282](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/282)) and `golang.org/x/net` ([#283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/283)).

### ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry
The focus was on planning for future improvements to the registry's architecture and maintainability.
-   A new proposal was opened to improve how chain configurations are managed ([#978](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/978)). The goal is to reduce the potential for stale contract addresses in configuration files, making the registry more accurate and easier to update.
