# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 6 - 12, 2024)

## Executive Summary
This week, the team focused on strategic planning to ensure the long-term scalability and maintainability of the Superchain. We identified a critical bottleneck in the current upgrade process for L2 chains and began architectural work to design a more efficient system that will support the continued growth of our ecosystem.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

-   **Architecting for a More Scalable Superchain**
    *Goal: To support the growing number of chains in the Superchain, we must make the process of deploying network-wide upgrades more efficient and cost-effective.*
    -   A major bottleneck was identified in the core protocol that makes upgrading multiple chains expensive and slow due to the high gas costs of deploying new contracts for each chain. This work was detailed in the [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) repository.
    -   Planning is now underway to re-architect core fault proof contracts. This change will significantly reduce costs and enable faster, batched upgrades across the entire Superchain ecosystem.

### Cross-Repository Coordination
-   **Architectural Alignment on Superchain Upgrades**: Efforts this week involved coordination between the core protocol implementation in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` and high-level planning in a related design document ([design-docs/pull/275](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/275)). This ensures that the proposed solution for more efficient upgrades is strategically sound and well-documented before development work begins.

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
-   This week's efforts were focused entirely on strategic planning rather than code merges, addressing a foundational challenge for the Superchain's future.
-   A key issue was opened to address a scalability bottleneck in the Superchain upgrade process ([#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421)). The current system requires costly contract redeployments for each L2 chain, limiting the efficiency of network-wide upgrades.
-   Discussion centered on refactoring the dispute game contracts to create a shared, reusable implementation. This is a critical step for enabling cheaper, batched upgrades and supporting the long-term growth of the Superchain.
