# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Dec 1 - 7, 2024)

## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
This was a quiet week focused on future planning rather than active code development. The primary activity involved scoping out a new "Creator" pattern, laying the strategic groundwork for upcoming enhancements to the Optimism protocol. This preparatory work ensures that future development is well-designed and aligned with long-term goals.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Planning for Future Protocol Enhancements**
_Goal: To design and scope new foundational features before beginning implementation, ensuring a robust and well-thought-out architecture._
-   Initial planning began for a new "Creator" pattern, a foundational element intended to improve how contracts are deployed and managed on the network. This work was captured in the [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) repository.

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
Activity this week centered on planning for future development, with no new code merged.
-   A new issue was created to outline the implementation of a "Creator" pattern ([#13168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13168)). This initial plan includes finalizing the design, implementing the necessary smart contracts, and identifying required changes to the Optimism Proposer and Challenger Module (OPCM).
