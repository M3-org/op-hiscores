# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, the project made significant strides in preparing for the upcoming Jovian and U17 network upgrades, a coordinated effort spanning multiple teams to enhance the entire Superchain. This forward-looking work was balanced with a deep focus on improving the stability of the core platform and strengthening ecosystem collaboration, highlighted by a key bug fix developed with the Celestia team to improve alternative data availability.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Preparing for Major Network Upgrades**
_Goal: To ensure a smooth and secure rollout of new features and improvements across all chains in the Superchain._
-   Coordinated preparations for the U17 upgrade across numerous mainnet and testnet chains, including Base, Zora, and Metal, by opening upgrade-specific pull requests in [ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops).
-   Updated the core software for the Jovian hard fork by integrating new features and removing temporary toggles in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).
-   Implemented new Jovian features in the execution client, including updated receipt fields and precompile limits, in [ethereum-optimism/op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth).
-   Set the official Jovian activation timestamp across 36 network configurations in the Superchain's central registry, marking a critical step toward the upgrade in [ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry).

**Enhancing Platform Stability and Developer Experience**
_Goal: To provide a more reliable and accessible foundation for developers building on the OP Stack._
-   Created a comprehensive set of new technical specifications for core components like bridging and fault proofs, providing a canonical reference for builders in [ethereum-optimism/specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs).
-   Made a concerted effort to improve the reliability of the testing infrastructure, fixing numerous flaky tests and hardening the developer environment in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).
-   Overhauled the documentation site's infrastructure by removing legacy systems to streamline the build process and improve content integrity in [ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs).
-   Introduced rate-limiting on a core infrastructure service to improve performance and protect against abuse in [ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra).

**Strengthening the Superchain Ecosystem and Interoperability**
_Goal: To support the growth of a diverse network of chains and ensure seamless operation for partners and L3s._
-   Resolved a critical bug in the `op-batcher` that improves support for alternative data availability layers, a fix developed in collaboration with the Celestia team and merged in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).
-   Expanded the Superchain's recognized assets by adding the ENSC token for the Lisk network in [ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io).
-   Actively engaged with third-party developers to address compatibility issues caused by recent updates and began work to simplify the configuration process for L3s, with discussions spanning [ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io), [ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra), and [ethereum-optimism/specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

-   **Jovian & U17 Network Upgrades:** Preparing the Superchain for upcoming hard forks required synchronized changes across multiple repositories. This involved implementing new features in `optimism` and `op-geth`, updating the official protocol documentation in `specs`, setting activation times in `superchain-registry`, and staging the upgrades for individual chains in `superchain-ops`.
-   **Alternative Data Availability (AltDA) Integration:** A bug affecting the `op-batcher`'s performance with AltDA layers like Celestia was discussed across `infra`, `specs`, and `op-analytics`. The solution, developed in collaboration with the Celestia team, was ultimately integrated into the core `optimism` repository, demonstrating a healthy, cross-ecosystem partnership to solve a shared problem.
