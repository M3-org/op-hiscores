# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Nov 24 - 30, 2024)

## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
This was a quiet week focused on planning and identifying future work rather than active code development. A key outcome was the identification of a performance optimization for the `op-challenger`, highlighting an ongoing commitment to improving system efficiency and reducing operational load on the network.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

- **Improving System Efficiency and Performance**
  This initiative focuses on making our core infrastructure more efficient to reduce operational costs and ensure the stability of the network's security components.
  - A performance bottleneck was identified in the `op-challenger`, which was making an excessive number of calls to the L1 node. A new issue was created in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to explore adding a configuration that would limit how frequently games are processed, aiming to significantly reduce system load.

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
- Development focus shifted to planning and optimization, highlighted by the creation of a new issue to address performance in the `op-challenger`. Issue [#13090](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13090) proposes a solution to reduce the high frequency of L1 node calls, which will improve the component's efficiency.
