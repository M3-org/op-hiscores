# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Nov 23 - 29, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week's efforts balanced foundational upgrades for future growth with a sharp focus on immediate network stability. Significant progress was made on long-term initiatives, including a new specification for Custom Gas Tokens and an overhaul of the contract management system. Concurrently, a coordinated, cross-team investigation is underway to diagnose a critical sequencer bug and address emerging performance bottlenecks on Base Mainnet, reinforcing our commitment to a secure and reliable Superchain.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Advancing Future Protocol Capabilities**
_Goal: To build the next generation of features that will enhance the flexibility, security, and scalability of the OP Stack and Superchain._
-   **Custom Gas Tokens (CGT):** Foundational work progressed to allow Superchain networks to use tokens other than ETH for transaction fees. A comprehensive specification was introduced in [ethereum-optimism/specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs), while the core implementation advanced significantly in the [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) repository, moving the feature closer to release.
-   **Next-Generation Proof System:** Strategic planning for the future of the protocol's security continued, with deep architectural discussions on implementing ZK (Zero-Knowledge) proofs. Teams across [ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs) and [ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry) are designing the new system, including how to generate and verify proofs.
-   **Modernized Contract Management:** A major overhaul of the contract management system, OPCM v2, was advanced in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism). This new architecture will simplify future network upgrades and deployments, making the system more robust and easier to manage.

**Strengthening Protocol Stability and Performance**
_Goal: To ensure the network remains reliable, secure, and performant for all users and applications._
-   **Critical Bug Investigation:** A high-priority, cross-team investigation is focused on a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recovery mode that could cause the chain to stall. This effort, tracked across multiple repositories including [ethereum-optimism/specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs) and [ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops), is critical for maintaining protocol stability.
-   **Addressing Network Performance:** New performance issues on Base Mainnet, including RPC timeouts and batch submission delays, were identified in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism). This has become a new area of focus to ensure the network can handle high demand efficiently.
-   **Improving Cross-Client Compatibility:** A key milestone was achieved with the successful re-integration of `op-reth` (an alternative client implementation) into the main test suite. This was confirmed across [ethereum-optimism/op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth) and [ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra), strengthening the diversity and resilience of the Superchain ecosystem.

**Enhancing Developer and Operator Experience**
_Goal: To provide builders with accurate documentation, powerful tools, and clear resources._
-   **Documentation and Tooling Improvements:** The [ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs) team merged numerous fixes to repair broken links and correct outdated information. In parallel, [ethereum-optimism/op-analytics](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics) introduced a new tool for analyzing fee market dynamics, providing deeper insights for developers.
-   **Community Contributions:** The project saw valuable engagement from the community, with a new contributor volunteering to fix incorrect Docker image references and add missing environment variable descriptions, improving resources for node operators.

### Cross-Repository Coordination
This week highlighted strong collaboration on several key initiatives:
-   **Sequencer Bug Investigation:** The investigation into the `op-node` sequencer bug ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18350)) is a coordinated effort involving developers from `specs`, `docs`, `superchain-ops`, `optimism`, and `op-analytics`, demonstrating a unified response to a critical stability concern.
-   **ZK Proof System Design:** Architectural planning for the next-generation ZK proof system is happening in lockstep across `docs`, `optimism`, and `superchain-registry`, ensuring a cohesive strategy for this long-term security upgrade.
-   **Multi-Client Testing:** The successful integration of `op-reth` into acceptance tests was a shared milestone, with work in `op-geth` and `infra` being validated and confirmed across the `optimism` and `docs` repositories.
