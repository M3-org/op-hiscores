# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week was dedicated to strategic planning and preparation for significant future upgrades to the Optimism protocol. While no major features were released, the team made substantial progress in laying the groundwork for the upcoming "flashblocks" feature and other key enhancements, ensuring they will be deployed securely and reliably.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Laying the Groundwork for Major Protocol Upgrades**
This foundational work is crucial for ensuring that future features, which will enhance network performance and capabilities, are rolled out smoothly, securely, and with robust monitoring in place.
-   Defined detailed deployment and load testing plans for the upcoming "flashblocks" feature, which is designed to improve transaction processing ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
-   Established comprehensive monitoring and alerting requirements for "flashblocks" to guarantee network stability and performance upon release ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
-   Initiated formal planning for a "Min Base Fee" feature and an upgrade to the latest version of Geth, setting the stage for future protocol improvements ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).

**Bolstering Protocol Reliability and Test Coverage**
Enhancing our testing infrastructure is vital for increasing the protocol's resilience, catching potential bugs early, and maintaining the highest standards of security.
-   Work began on introducing fuzz testing, a powerful technique for automatically discovering vulnerabilities, to a key Supervisor component ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
-   Expanded the project's acceptance test suite to provide more comprehensive validation of the system's end-to-end behavior ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
The core protocol repository was a hub of planning and preparation for future work. The focus was on ensuring upcoming features are robust, secure, and well-tested before release.
-   Extensive planning was conducted for the "flashblocks" feature, including defining deployment strategies ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16759)), load testing procedures ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16756)), and detailed monitoring requirements ([#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16388)).
-   Tracking issues were created to manage significant future work, including the implementation of a "Min Base Fee" ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16807)) and the merge of Geth v1.16.1 ([#16825](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16825)).
-   A new pull request was opened to introduce fuzz testing to the Supervisor, aiming to increase its resilience against unexpected inputs ([#16791](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16791)).
-   Work is underway to enhance the test suite by adding more `sysgo` tests to `op-acceptance-tests` ([#16817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16817)).
