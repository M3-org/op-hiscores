# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week was defined by a dual focus on strengthening our foundations and planning for future innovation. We executed a massive, project-wide initiative to clean up technical debt and streamline backlogs, enhancing developer focus and efficiency. Simultaneously, we laid the formal groundwork for significant new capabilities, including ZK game integration and a Light Consensus Layer, positioning the OP Stack for its next phase of growth.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Improving Project Health and Developer Focus**
_Goal: To increase development velocity and long-term stability by systematically reducing technical debt and clarifying our current work priorities._
- A massive backlog grooming effort was completed across nearly all repositories, closing hundreds of outdated or resolved issues related to test flakiness, deprecated features, and node stability.
- A coordinated review of the codebase identified outstanding tasks previously tracked only in code comments (`TODOs`). These were converted into formal issues to ensure they are properly addressed, improving transparency and accountability ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry), [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs), and others).
- The developer test environment was simplified by formally deprecating the old "KT" devnet and closing dozens of related acceptance test issues in the [infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra) repository.

**Laying the Groundwork for Next-Generation Features**
_Goal: To begin the development of major new protocol features that will expand the capabilities of the OP Stack and the Superchain._
- Planning was formally kicked off for integrating ZK (Zero-Knowledge) games, with a suite of new issues created to track work on proof generation, monitoring, and challenging mechanisms in the [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) monorepo.
- The "Light Consensus Layer" initiative was formalized, a feature that will enable more flexible and efficient node configurations. This included adding new flags to `op-node` ([#18270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18270)) and creating a main tracking issue ([#18315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18315)).

**Strengthening the Superchain's Economic Framework**
_Goal: To enhance the economic sustainability of the Superchain and make it easier for new chains to participate in the ecosystem._
- New templates were introduced in [superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops) to provide chains with a clear path for upgrading their vaults and opting into the revenue-sharing model ([#1257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1257)).
- To improve fee market stability, bounds for minimum base fees were added to the standard configurations for mainnet and Sepolia in the [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry) ([#1127](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1127), [#1163](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1163)).

**Bolstering Core Protocol Security and Stability**
_Goal: To ensure the core protocol remains secure, reliable, and aligned with the broader Ethereum ecosystem._
- The [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth) client was updated by merging upstream changes from `go-ethereum v1.16.4` ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/689)), ensuring it benefits from the latest L1 developments.
- The protocol's resilience during network upgrades was improved by adding alternative recovery methods for hardfork activations in [design-docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs) ([#357](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/357)).
- A correction to the flashblocks specification was merged in [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs), improving protocol accuracy ([#860](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/860)).

**Improving the Developer and Operator Experience**
_Goal: To make it easier for developers and node operators to build on and interact with the Optimism ecosystem._
- The [docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs) site underwent a major navigation refactor to improve content discoverability for developers and operators ([#1872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1872)).
- Key guides for node operators, such as the snap sync documentation, were restructured for better clarity and organization ([#1851](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1851)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

This week highlighted strong alignment across teams on strategic priorities:

- **Technical Debt Initiative:** A coordinated effort, visible in `optimism`, `specs`, `design-docs`, `op-analytics`, and `superchain-registry`, involved systematically reviewing old issues and cross-referencing them with the codebase to find and formally track remaining work. This ensures that cleanup from past refactors is fully completed.
- **Strategic Feature Decisions:** A unified decision was made across multiple repositories to observe the `min-base-fee` feature's performance in production rather than conduct further simulations ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16958)). Additionally, teams aligned on deferring fixes for `op-node`'s EL Sync behavior until the older request/response sync mechanism is fully deprecated, avoiding redundant work.
- **Upgrade Preparedness:** The core development team (`op-geth`, `superchain-ops`) coordinated with the `docs` team to ensure that critical requirements for upcoming upgrades, such as the `cannonKonaPrestate` ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095)), are clearly documented for operators.
