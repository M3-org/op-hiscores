# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

This week, the project made significant strides in finalizing the upcoming Jovian network upgrade while simultaneously advancing preparations for the future Fusaka upgrade. Key efforts also focused on evolving the next-generation fault dispute system and improving the developer experience, demonstrating a strong focus on both near-term delivery and long-term platform health.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Finalizing the Jovian Network Upgrade**
*Goal: This work locks in the features and configurations for the upgrade, ensuring a secure and predictable rollout across the Superchain.*
-   Feature toggles for the Jovian upgrade were removed in [ethereum-optimism/op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth), signaling that the scope is now settled and development is complete ([#703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/703)).
-   A bug in the `GasPriceOracle` was fixed in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to correctly calculate operator fees for the Jovian hardfork, resolving a previously identified issue ([#17913](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17913)).
-   Final specifications were merged in [ethereum-optimism/specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs), clarifying genesis block behavior and updating transaction bytecode to finalize the upgrade's technical details ([#801](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/801), [#804](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/804)).

**Advancing the Next-Generation Fault Proof System**
*Goal: We are building a more modular and flexible dispute system to support a wider variety of proof systems, enhancing the security and decentralization of the Superchain.*
-   The core contract management system was upgraded in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to support the new V2 dispute game contracts, enabling a more flexible pattern for adding new game types in the future ([#17782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17782), [#17874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17874)).
-   Architectural refinements were made to the V2 contracts, allowing a single deployment to be used for multiple game types and improving efficiency ([#17832](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17832)).

**Improving the Developer and Operator Experience**
*Goal: Creating clear documentation, stable tools, and automated processes is crucial for enabling builders and operators to contribute to the ecosystem effectively.*
-   A major restructuring of the app developer documentation was completed in [ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs), improving the organization and accessibility of over 50 guides and tutorials ([#1792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1792)).
-   A strategic shift in local development tooling was solidified by deprecating the older Kurtosis tool in favor of enhancing `op-up` as the primary method for spinning up local test networks ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16975), [#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17942)).
-   New CI automation was added to [ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry) to automatically generate code and open pull requests, streamlining repository maintenance ([#1120](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1120)).

**Preparing for the Future Fusaka Upgrade**
*Goal: By completing preparatory work on testnet, we are de-risking the future Mainnet deployment and ensuring a smooth transition.*
-   Key preparatory tasks, including the `op-geth` merge and absolute prestate updates, were confirmed as complete on the Sepolia testnet across multiple repositories like [ethereum-optimism/design-docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs) and [ethereum-optimism/op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth). Attention has now shifted to tracking the rollout for Mainnet ([#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/682), [#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/1206)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

-   **Upgrade Coordination (Jovian & Fusaka):** Finalizing the Jovian upgrade and preparing for Fusaka required a coordinated effort across the stack. Repositories including `optimism`, `op-geth`, `specs`, and `docs` worked in lockstep to update code, finalize specifications, remove feature flags, and close out related issues, ensuring all components are aligned for the upcoming changes.
-   **Maintaining Superchain Compatibility:** An important cross-team discussion ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17907)) focused on how to introduce new configuration fields for the Jovian upgrade without breaking compatibility for external ecosystem partners, particularly zk stacks. This highlights a commitment to maintaining a stable and interoperable Superchain for all participants.
