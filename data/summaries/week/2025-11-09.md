# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, the project focused on strengthening the core foundations of the OP Stack through a significant overhaul of testing and deployment infrastructure. This foundational work ran in parallel with extensive preparations for the upcoming Jovian network upgrade, ensuring the Superchain remains stable, secure, and ready for its next evolution.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Bolstering Core Infrastructure and Testing**
*To increase development velocity and ensure the long-term reliability of the OP Stack, we invested heavily in our internal tooling, testing frameworks, and continuous integration (CI/CD) pipelines.*
-   The testing framework was significantly expanded to cover more network configurations and increase fuzz testing for core smart contracts, improving protocol robustness. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism))
-   The CI/CD pipeline was optimized by migrating away from self-hosted runners and improving artifact management, leading to faster and more reliable builds. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism))
-   A new automated workflow was introduced to build and attest `op-geth` releases, enhancing the security and integrity of the client software. ([ethereum-optimism/op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth))
-   A persistent tooling installation error was resolved, and a security update was applied to core infrastructure, improving stability for developers and operators. ([ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra))

**Preparing the Superchain for the Jovian Upgrade**
*To ensure a smooth and secure transition for the entire ecosystem, we finalized preparations for the upcoming Jovian (U17) network upgrade.*
-   Extensive configuration and documentation updates were completed for the Base Sepolia and Sepolia stacks, ensuring all chains are prepared for the upgrade. ([ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops))
-   New release notices for the Jovian upgrade were published, keeping node operators and the community informed of the upcoming changes. ([ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs))
-   A critical testing milestone was achieved across the stack, confirming that proof validation for the Jovian upgrade is successfully integrated and running automatically. ([ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra), [ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs), [ethereum-optimism/op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth), [ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops), [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), [ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry))

**Improving Developer and Operator Experience**
*To empower builders and support the network, we enhanced our documentation and tooling, making it easier to develop on and operate Optimism-powered chains.*
-   The Actions SDK documentation was significantly expanded with new reference pages for wallet integration and API usage, providing developers with more comprehensive resources. ([ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs))
-   The node troubleshooting guide was improved to help operators more easily diagnose issues with their infrastructure. ([ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs))
-   Support for zstd compression was added to `op-acceptor` images, improving data handling efficiency for infrastructure operators. ([ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra))

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Jovian Upgrade Readiness**
A coordinated effort across multiple teams ensured the ecosystem is prepared for the Jovian network upgrade. The `superchain-ops` team managed the low-level configuration changes, the `docs` team handled public communication, and a key testing issue ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17303)) was closed across six repositories, confirming that automated action tests are in place to validate the upgrade's integrity.

**Shared Protocol Optimization Efforts**
Discussions on improving core protocol performance and safety took place across the project. A key topic was the optimization of `op-node`'s communication with the execution layer to reduce "FCU spam" ([#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15393)). This collaborative discussion culminated in a concrete improvement merged in the `optimism` repository to debounce these messages ([#18234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18234)), demonstrating how shared analysis leads to direct protocol enhancements.
