# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Nov 30 - 6, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, Optimism made a pivotal strategic decision to integrate ZK fault proofs directly into the existing `op-challenger` system, streamlining our security roadmap and resolving a major research effort. This decision was immediately followed by a significant development push to implement the core logic for ZK games. In parallel, the team shipped critical stability fixes for core network components and continued to expand the Superchain with the integration of new chains.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Advancing Protocol Security with ZK Fault Proofs**
*Strategic Importance: This initiative enhances the security and decentralization of the OP Stack's dispute resolution system, preparing the protocol for the next generation of fraud-proof technology.*
-   A key strategic decision was made to use the existing `op-challenger` for ZK games, concluding a major research spike and providing a clear path forward for implementation ([`specs`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18322)).
-   A significant development effort in the `optimism` repository delivered the core logic for ZK game challenges, including architectural refactoring and new functionality for challenging proposals, reclaiming bonds, and resolving games ([#18441](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18441), [#18442](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18442), [#18464](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18464)).
-   The strategy for ZK proof generation was finalized, with the task assigned to the succinct proposer, closing out a key investigation ([`superchain-registry`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18319)).

**Improving Network Stability and Reliability**
*Strategic Importance: This work ensures the network remains robust and dependable for all users and node operators, addressing issues that could impact performance and uptime.*
-   A critical fix was shipped in `optimism` to prevent the sequencer from stalling during network reorganizations, directly improving network uptime ([#18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)).
-   Bugs in the `op-batcher` were resolved in `optimism` to improve its handling of large block backlogs, enhancing the reliability of data submission to L1 ([#18344](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18344)).
-   Key stability issues reported by the community, such as `op-node` synchronization problems, are being actively tracked and investigated across multiple repositories, including [`superchain-ops`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18468) and [`infra`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17448), to prioritize future fixes.

**Expanding and Standardizing the Superchain**
*Strategic Importance: These efforts grow the network of interoperable chains and ensure they are built on a consistent, well-defined foundation, making the ecosystem easier to join and manage.*
-   The Superchain was expanded with the integration of Base as an executed upgrade and the completion of key setup tasks for Worldchain in `superchain-ops` ([#1312](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1312), [#1284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1284)).
-   Work progressed on creating a standard `SuperchainDefinition` type within the official `specs`, which will make it easier to configure and manage chains across the ecosystem ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/867)).
-   Development began in `superchain-registry` to streamline the process of adding new chains by allowing for embedded contract artifacts ([#1172](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1172)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination
This week highlighted strong coordination on several key initiatives that spanned the entire project:
-   **ZK Challenger Strategy:** The decision to integrate ZK game logic into `op-challenger` was a project-wide effort. The decision was tracked and finalized across issues in `specs`, `ecosystem`, `superchain-ops`, `infra`, `docs`, and `op-geth`, culminating in a focused implementation sprint within the `optimism` repository.
-   **Superchain Standardization:** The effort to formalize the `SuperchainConfig` type involved collaborative discussion across `specs`, `ecosystem`, `op-geth`, and `infra` to ensure the new specification is clear, language-agnostic, and meets the needs of the growing Superchain.
-   **Node Stability Monitoring:** Community-reported issues with `op-node` and `proxyd` were tracked and validated across `superchain-ops`, `infra`, `docs`, and `superchain-registry`, creating a unified view of operator pain points that informs development priorities in the core `optimism` repository.
