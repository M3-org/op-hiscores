# Overall Project Weekly Summary (May 11 - 17, 2025)

## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
This week was dedicated to planning and foundational work for future protocol enhancements across the Optimism ecosystem. While no major features were shipped, key initiatives were started to advance Superchain interoperability, explore new protocol designs, and improve long-term code maintainability, setting the stage for the next phase of development.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Advancing Protocol Design and Superchain Interoperability**
*This work is critical for evolving the OP Stack and strengthening the security and capabilities of the interconnected Superchain ecosystem.*
-   Formal planning began for a future "Interop proofs" upgrade, a key technical priority for enhancing cross-chain security within the Superchain ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
-   Exploration started on a new protocol concept with the introduction of a "Flashblock Spec" draft, initiating the design and review process for a potential future enhancement ([ethereum-optimism/specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs)).

**Improving Code Quality and Operational Excellence**
*This foundational work ensures our codebase is maintainable and our operational procedures are robust, which is vital for long-term stability and a better developer experience.*
-   Work began on a significant cleanup of the L2 test suite to improve its structure and documentation, making the codebase easier to maintain and contribute to ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).
-   An initiative was started to standardize operational documentation by proposing a refactor of the upgrade runbook for better consistency and clarity ([ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra)).

## Repository Spotlights

### ethereum-optimism/specs
-   Work began on a new protocol design with the introduction of a draft for the "Flashblock Spec" ([#703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/703)), marking the start of the formal design process for this concept.

### ethereum-optimism/infra
-   A new issue was opened to improve operational consistency by proposing a refactor of the upgrade runbook to align its format with the mainnet migration playbook ([#347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/347)).

### ethereum-optimism/optimism
-   A tracking issue was created for the "Interop proofs U17 proof upgrade" ([#15980](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15980)), formalizing a key workstream focused on enhancing Superchain interoperability.
-   Efforts to improve code quality and maintainability began with a refactor of the L2 test suite structure and documentation ([#15862](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/15862)).
