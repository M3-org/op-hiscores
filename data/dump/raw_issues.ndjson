Therefore we can expect upstream merges (and other PRs which intend to break something) to have this new CI check fail. That could be solved by having the check be lablled \"for information only\" (and therefore ignorable by such PRs, which can follow the usual pattern). \n\n\n## Option B\nAnother alternative would be have a lightweight CI check in op-geth which checks for the existence of an actual monorepo PR referencing the new code with passing tests. This check can be cheaply re-run by the PR author when they have that monorepo PR prepared. This meshes nicely with existing practices for significant PRs, but would require a little more manual work from PR authors which might be considered bothersome for small changes. IMO this is probably the right amount of friction to add here. Monorepo PRs could be automatically created by an `op-workbench` command, which would put the commit hash in the PR title to make it easy to find for the new CI job. Or, the new CI job accepts the monorepo PR number as an input parameter which the user supplies when it is launched.

Version `1` will also contain an incrementing nonce in the upper 128-bits of the version argument.

["I_kwDOKSJyfM5_YyZb", 127, "Event Log Indexing Service Spec", "# Event Log Indexing Service\r\n\r\nWe're planning on spinning up a brand new micro service to help us with our smart contract log indexing needs that we can utilize across all of our products, demos, and prototypes.\r\n\r\nWe plan on building this service on top of [Ponder](https://ponder.sh/) this is an open source framework that makes indexing logs extremely easy. It will allow the team to move much faster than we currently are moving when it comes to indexing, and it will also help show the community how they can easily get some indexing setup for their own projects.\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\nOne thing to keep in mind as we go through what this will look like is we want this service to be able to scale up to being able to index 100's of contracts at once even though the initial versions of the service will only be indexing a handful of contracts across some OP chains. This means we're going to attempt to structure the code in a way that will allow multiple engineers to build on top of this and commit code without always running into merge conflicts and stepping on each others toes.\r\n\r\nBelow is how we plan to setup the initial directory structure. This example is just for illustration to show what it would look like if we were to index 2 different contracts.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 /abis\r\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 optimist.ts\r\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 attestationStation.ts\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 /generated\r\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 schema.graphql\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 /src\r\n|   \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.ts\r\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 /constants\r\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 contracts.ts\r\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 networks.ts\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 /events\r\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 optimist.ts\r\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 attestationStation.ts\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ponder-env.d.ts\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ponder.config.ts\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ponder.schema.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll talk about some of the directories below to explain whats happening a bit more but won't go over all of them would recommend reading up on how Ponder works: https://ponder.sh/\r\n\r\n### /abis\r\nThis directory is literally what it say it's just going to contain all ABI definitions in typescript. Ponder uses ABIType to allow strict type checking across everything so the definitions just need to conform to what ABIType is expecting.\r\n\r\nEach file under this directory will represent an individual contract and will only contain that contracts ABI and nothing else.\r\n\r\n### /generated\r\nWill just contain our graphql schema, there is nothing that needs to be edited here this file will automatically be generated when running `pnpm codegen` or in our case would be `pnpm nx run @eth-optimism/event-log-indexer:codegen`. This file gets generated based off of the schema defined in `ponder.schema.ts`\r\n\r\n### index.ts\r\nRepresents the main function where we'll be able to register all of our event listeners and create general puprose objects like loggers and error reports, that can be utilized in our event handlers\r\n\r\n### contracts.ts\r\nAt first we'll ship this will just a single file that contains the configuration that ponder needs to understand what contracts need to be indexed, whats the address and starting block. Eventually this will most likely need to be broken out into individual files for each contract but want to avoid that at first until it's needed.\r\n\r\nExample of what it will look like.\r\n```\r\nimport { optimism, optimismSepolia } from 'viem/chains'\r\n\r\nimport { optimistAbi } from '../../abis/optimist'\r\n\r\nexport const optimist = {\r\n  abi: optimistAbi,\r\n  network: {\r\n    [optimism.id]: {\r\n      address: '0x2335022c740d17c2837f9C884Bfe4fFdbf0A95D5',\r\n      filter: { event: 'Transfer' },\r\n      startBlock: 49670714,\r\n    },\r\n    [optimismSepolia.id]: {\r\n      address: '0xF6Ec1682996633B7cde3D8e33a9FD32686E993D3',\r\n      filter: { event: 'Transfer' },\r\n      startBlock: 2708644,\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n} as const\r\n```\r\n\r\n### networks.ts\r\nThis file will contain all of the configuration needed to for all the networks that will be used in this service\r\n\r\nExample\r\n```\r\nimport { http } from 'viem'\r\nimport { optimism, optimismSepolia } from 'viem/chains'\r\n\r\nexport const networks = {\r\n  [optimism.id]: {\r\n    chainId: optimism.id,\r\n    transport: http(process.env.JSON_RPC_URL_OP_MAINNET),\r\n  },\r\n  [optimismSepolia.id]: {\r\n    chainId: optimismSepolia.id,\r\n    transport: http(process.env.JSON_RPC_URL_OP_SEPOLIA),\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### /events\r\nThis directory will contain individual files for each contract that we are going to index. This is where we have functions that will allow us to register events to be indexed. It will export a register function that will be called in `index.ts`, we're trying to break up how all the events will be registered to avoid having any super long files. We're also breaking out the functions to be pure so it will be easier to write unit tests against them so we don't have to ever worry about mocking anything with ponder.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n```\r\nexport const NULL_ADDRESS = toHex(0, { size: 20 })\r\n\r\nexport async function transfer(\r\n  args: IndexingFunctionArgs<'optimist:Transfer'>,\r\n) {\r\n  const { event, context } = args\r\n\r\n  const { Optimist } = context.db\r\n\r\n  const { chainId } = context.network\r\n  const { hash: transactionHash, blockNumber } = event.transaction\r\n  const { from, to, tokenId } = event.args\r\n\r\n  if (from === NULL_ADDRESS) {\r\n    await Optimist.upsert({\r\n      id: to,\r\n      create: {\r\n        chainId,\r\n        tokenId,\r\n        transactionHash,\r\n        blockNumber,\r\n      },\r\n      update: {},\r\n    })\r\n  } else if (to === NULL_ADDRESS) {\r\n    await Optimist.delete({ id: from })\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function registerOptimstEvents() {\r\n  ponder.on('optimist:Transfer', transfer)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Deployment \r\n\r\nThe initial plan is to deploy this service with k8s that will also hit a Postgres db in GCP. We're going to ship this as a multichain service at first until we have a reason to break the service out by network. The examples above show both OP mainnet & sepolia that we plan on indexing at first. If we ever run into scaling issues we'll break this up to run multiple variants of the service by network\r\n\r\nMultiple chains in a single instance:\r\n<img width=\"411\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-15 at 1 46 11\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/assets/1761993/97df4b0e-96ce-47af-84c2-806fd4387b04\">\r\n\r\nMultiple chains where each instance represents a different network:\r\n<img width=\"414\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-15 at 1 46 57\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/assets/1761993/5c5abac9-f9df-4c68-afd3-74a745821e79\">\r\n\r\nThe initial implementation of this can be found here: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/123", "CLOSED", 0, "nitaliano", "2024-02-15T18:49:13Z", "2024-09-06T14:45:57Z", "2024-09-06T14:45:57Z", "ethereum-optimism/ecosystem", "2025-08-30 07:11:05"]

Rather than using `debug_dumpBlock` in `geth`, we should just be able to use `anvil`'s `anvil_dumpState` endpoint.\r\n\r\nAnvil's `anvil_dumpState` endpoint returns a gzip compressed hex string of a JSON object with the following schema:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"accounts\": {\r\n        \"0x...00\": {\r\n            \"nonce\": \"<hex_number>\",\r\n            \"balance\": \"<hex_number>\",\r\n            \"code\": \"<bytes>\",\r\n            \"storage\": {\r\n                 \"<32b_slot>\": \"<32b_value>\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo easily convert the gzipped state back to JSON:\r\n```sh\r\ncast rpc anvil_dumpState --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 | jq -r | xxd -r -p | gzip -d\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are several default accounts in anvil that will be present within this state dump. To avoid this, pass `-a 1` to the anvil binary to only generate 1 default account, and filter it out when serializing the allocs in the devnet script. The create2 deployer is also deployed by default @ `0x4e59b44847b379578588920ca78fbf26c0b4956c`\r\n\r\n### Output\r\n\r\nThe end result should be that the devnet is no longer reliant on `geth` to generate the state snapshots for `op-e2e` L1 allocs.", "CLOSED", 0, "clabby", "2023-11-15T14:33:49Z", "2024-01-03T05:40:25Z", "2024-01-03T05:40:24Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-30 07:18:00"]

Please describe.**\r\nThe `ProxyAdmin` is, I believe, one of the most crucial pieces within the OP Stack.  That being said, transferring ownership for the `ProxyAdmin` is only a single step.  So, as soon as the ownership transfer tx is submitted, the `ProxyAdmin` owner is changed.\r\n\r\nThis can be an issue for several reasons:\r\n- There's always the possibility of fat-finger ownership transfer to an unintended recipient (which may or may not have control over their PK).\r\n- The fact that the `ProxyAdmin` can be changed and modify all controlled contracts within the same tx is quite uneasing.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI suggest using OZ's [Ownable2Step](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/access#Ownable2Step) to further solidify ownership transfer.  With this module, ownership is not transferred *until* the recipient accepts the transfer.  Therefore:\r\n- It is impossible to accidentally transfer `ProxyAdmin` ownership.\r\n- Ownership transfer and controlled contract execution is impossible within the same transaction as there needs to be a transaction by the owner to submit ownership transfer, and a second tx for the recipient to accept.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this can be done with the current `ProxyAdmin` on OP mainnet and live  Superchains.

When the L2 signature asked for 350,000,000 USDC.e there was no option to optimize the allocated amount signed from the wallet given access. Even though a bridge was being constructed this configuration confuses the user. This new transaction was applied from the previous transaction (airdrop) not allowing the wallet owner to understand this was a designed bridge that was new; instead it came from the first airdrop with the \u201cwithdrawal button\u201d highlighted. Noticing the 0x Flashbot lead to researching to ensure no signature attack was detected. Is there a tool to help a user identify this was a bridge mission; especially for a new transaction, because this is what raised concerns from the wallet this happened in. Would like to have this documented as a way to help apply to an app. Next time will apply the notes of what was found through OKX that raised questions. Time though finally told the truth. This could be an added feature to a future IDS (Intrusion Detection System), or alert system as a way to implement alerts for security and detection purposes.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @philliprossii in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/8770#issuecomment-1868604518_\r\n            ", "CLOSED", 0, "philliprossii", "2024-01-14T22:17:57Z", "2024-02-29T23:38:43Z", "2024-02-05T00:54:58Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-30 08:40:36"]

We need to differentiate -- color and icon -- for the default callout. It has nearly the same color visually as the warning callout, which makes the warning less effective and impacts site accessibility.  (See [this page ](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/notices/ecotone-fee-changes) for an example. Maybe we can use a pale yellow color??\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we could use two brand new callouts. \r\n\r\n2. One callout for success/congratulations (often used at the end of a tutorial or quick start, pale green in color and maybe a \ud83c\udf89 symbol) \r\n3. one callout for prereq info (before you start/pre-req/dependencies). possibly a light grey color?? Here's an example [pre-req callout](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/quick-start).\r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts\r\nI think an update to our callouts would provide clear and consistent markers for devs about what part or section of the guide they are reading, which aids in usability, accessibility, and the magical developer experience. \r\n\r\n![green-callout](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/assets/29023967/7ba4c8a3-6d5b-49fd-a88c-826f5d4a9d2f)\r\n![prereq-callout](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/assets/29023967/db92fbec-9250-4140-ac10-7bade956ae52)\r\n![congrats-callout](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/assets/29023967/b150215b-b164-4ba3-aac3-a9659f1932a9)\r\n", "CLOSED", 0, "cpengilly", "2024-02-21T05:03:55Z", "2024-03-08T02:19:17Z", "2024-03-08T02:19:16Z", "ethereum-optimism/docs", "2025-08-30 08:41:28"]

When a user wants to manually send ETH to Optimism mainnet, they send the ETH to the proxy contract. From there, Optimism reads events from the proxy to mint ETH for the user on L2.\r\n\r\nAs Optimism reads events from the Portal proxy, any transactions sent directly to the implementation will not be seen. Specifically, the `TransactionDeposited()` event that is emitted on `depositTransaction()` will never be picked up by Optimism.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a user should be able to withdraw from the L2 to the implementation directly. However, the user is unable to replay the transaction with `proveWithdrawalTransaction()` as the implementation is paused.\r\n\r\n**Impact Details**\r\nThis impacts all OP-stack chains as none of the implementations revert on receiving assets.

There needs to be some mechanism by which that cost is paid for by users. There are a few options here:\r\n- Enforce in the `CrossL2Inbox` a max number of executing messages per block. This would need to be coupled with a rule that marks reverting executing messages as resolved automatically instead of needing to fetch data from remote chains to resolve the executing messages. This can greatly reduce the cost in the derivation pipeline but adds a requirement of L2 receipt fetching from within derivation\r\n- Enforce in consensus a max number of executing messages per block. Any block with more than a certain number of executing messages is considered invalid and skipped. This means that a hardfork is required to change this value unless we decide to add it to the L1 attributes transaction so that it can be dynamically changed by the chain operator\r\n- Burn gas in the `CrossL2Inbox` to artificially make it more expensive to send cross chain messages. Ideally we avoid a concept of  an EIP-1559 like curve with a supply/demand curve and basefee because that is complex to test. We can burn a flat amount per message.

["I_kwDOLB-lzc6DNMDT", 101, "Proposal: live preimage collector", "## Background\r\n\r\nThe OP-Stack currently requires an archive node for some special tasks:\r\n- **output-root proposals** (withdrawal storage root): spanning at least an hour, or as long as the proposer is configured to wait before proposals. This may be multiplied, to not handle proposer downtime.\r\n- **fault-proof program execution** (historical L2 state): the last week worth of data, assuming a disputed L2 output root is no older than the last finalized L2 output root. This may be extended if there are very infrequent output-roots.\r\n\r\nArchive nodes retain *all* historical versions of the state, and are thus more burdensome to run than full nodes, due to increased resource usage, and difficulty syncing (just snap-syncing the latest state is insufficient).\r\n\r\nThe archive data that the op-stack relies on however does not span more than the most recent week worth of state. This can help bound the resource usage of the archive data significantly.\r\n\r\nNote that go-ethereum may implement a \"rolling archive mode\" at some point, but this would be single-client, and may not handle intermediate merkle-patricia-trie nodes as necessary.\r\n\r\nFor reference, OP-Mainnet full-node (pebble DB, path scheme) stats:\r\n```\r\n| Key-Value store       | Path trie account nodes | 18.98 GiB  |  165149260 |\r\n| Key-Value store       | Path trie storage nodes | 113.25 GiB | 1140900306 |\r\n| Key-Value store       | Account snapshot        | 8.05 GiB   |  124274313 |\r\n| Key-Value store       | Storage snapshot        | 57.15 GiB  |  832582174 |\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile large, this is signficiantly less than running an archive node (OP-Mainnet Hash-db, leveldb), which takes just under 5 TB total (most of which is state, since a full-node is ~450 GB total).\r\n\r\n## Towards a solution\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this, the OP-Stack could be extended with a special service that collects and maintains just the last week worth of preimage data. The preimage data can be collected when it is still \"hot\", i.e. from a full node, which retains the most recent history (128 L2 blocks, just over 4 minutes of data).\r\n\r\nSince output-proposing and fault-proving is not constrained on performance, the preimage collection does not have to be optimized. If the withdrawal-storage is available within an hour, and arbitrary state is available within hours, the use-case of the data is not really affected.\r\n\r\n## Possible shape of archive\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to do this:\r\n- A full copy of all state pre-images that are attached to a recent state-root\r\n- A combination of the latest state, and a running list of recently deleted preimages.\r\n\r\nThe latter approach may be more efficient, but also relies on the live DB serving the preimages reliably. Which includes intermediate MerklePatriciaTrie nodes and such.\r\n\r\nThe former approach requires more disk-space, but may be easier to maintain conceptually:\r\n- maintain a set of known state-roots\r\n- every few seconds, poll for new state-roots, add to the collection\r\n- every few seconds, poll for old state-roots, remove from the collection\r\n- garbage-collect any merkle-patricia-trie node that is not reachable from a known state-root. This can be done by implementing reference counting or some sweeping routine.\r\n- trace the L2 blocks of state-roots with unknown preimage data, to collect the list of changed accounts and storage values, and then collect the missing trie branches for the changes with batched `eth_getProof` calls.\r\n\r\nThe latter approach may be implemented by attaching a log to the execution-layer directly: whenever any preimage gets replaced/deleted, write it to the log. Then prune the log to not contain anything older than a week. The latest state, combined with recent changes, should cover the full set of preimages necessary for the OP-Stack.\r\n\r\n## Possible variants\r\n\r\nBy re-using the op-program, the preimages can be generated locally, by processing blocks on top of the existing pre-state. This removes the need for state-fetching through `eth_getProof` or similar, and also test-runs the op-program consistently; state-roots can be compared against the actual block state-roots.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\nThis service should expose a simple key-value getter API, for the `op-program` (in host mode) to collect state preimages from.\r\n", "OPEN", 0, "protolambda", "2024-03-21T22:05:37Z", "2024-03-22T01:43:57Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/specs", "2025-08-30 09:46:21"]

Its functionally the same as using aliasing but more simple\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress aliasing exists for L1 to L2 deposits because there is no guarantee that owner of the account on L1 is the owner of the account on L2. For EOAs, this is not an issue because the same keypair can generate signatures for both chains but for smart contracts, this is a valid concern. It prevents somebody from assuming the identity of a smart contract on L2 that they do not actually control.\r\n\r\nAliasing is built directly into the protocol via the `OptimismPortal`, see the code snippet below:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// Transform the from-address to its alias if the caller is a contract.\r\naddress from = msg.sender;\r\nif (msg.sender != tx.origin) {\r\n  from = AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(msg.sender);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is saying \u201cif the call comes from a smart contract, apply the alias\u201d. This results in the [DepositTx](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/blob/ef668c77e03f5401d2882bdfd51cbac8536aa4cd/core/types/deposit_tx.go#L29) having a an aliased `from` field. Contracts on L2 must unalias the `from` field if they want to know what the account of the sender is, meaning that they opt in to receiving messages from L1 contracts.\r\n\r\nThe same concept applies for L2 to L2 transactions - it is possible that the same account is owned by different entities between different L2s. A difference with the interop scheme is that the top level `transaction.from` on the executing message isn\u2019t necessarily the same entity that creates the initiating message. It is also the case that with our interop scheme the top level call will always be to the `CrossL2Inbox`. This may or may not go through the [`L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger`](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/predeploys.html#l2tol2crossdomainmessenger) after the `CrossL2Inbox`. When a user wants to do auth, they need to call back to `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` to get the sender of the initiating message. They will also need the chain id of the chain that initiated the message.\r\n\r\n### What Aliasing Could Look Like\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nlibrary AddressAliasHelper {\r\n    uint160 constant offset = uint160(0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111);\r\n\r\n    /// @notice Utility function that converts the address in the L1 that submitted a tx to\r\n    /// the inbox to the msg.sender viewed in the L2\r\n    /// @param l1Address the address in the L1 that triggered the tx to L2\r\n    /// @return l2Address L2 address as viewed in msg.sender\r\n    function applyL1ToL2Alias(address l1Address) internal pure returns (address l2Address) {\r\n        unchecked {\r\n            l2Address = address(uint160(l1Address) + offset);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /// @notice Utility function that converts the msg.sender viewed in the L2 to the\r\n    /// address in the L1 that submitted a tx to the inbox\r\n    /// @param l2Address L2 address as viewed in msg.sender\r\n    /// @return l1Address the address in the L1 that triggered the tx to L2\r\n    function undoL1ToL2Alias(address l2Address) internal pure returns (address l1Address) {\r\n        unchecked {\r\n            l1Address = address(uint160(l2Address) - offset);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function applyL2ToL2Alias(address localAddress) internal pure returns (address remoteAddress) {\r\n      unchecked {\r\n        remoteAddress = address(uint160(localAddress) + uint160(uint256(keccack(block.chainid))));\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function undoL2ToL2Alias(address remoteAddress, uint256 remoteChainId) internal pure returns (address localAddress) {\r\n      unchecked {\r\n        localAddress = address(uint160(l1Address) - uint160(uint256(keccack(remoteChainId))));\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo ensure that it is not possible to spoof having control of the identity of an account by controlling it on one of many possible domains, some unique information relevant to the chain must be used when aliasing. In the sample implementation, the `block.chainid` is used. This means that on the remote chain, there needs to be knowledge of the chain id of the initiating chain.\r\n\r\nThe executing message will never assume the identity via `msg.sender` or `tx.origin` since deposit transactions aren\u2019t used and the contract that is being called is at least 1 callframe deep.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to believe it is far more simple to not alias addresses and instead expose 2 pieces of information - the sender of the cross chain message and the chain id of the originating chain. Using the above address aliasing scheme requires the same information as the remote chain id is required to unalias the contract. Developers will be able to grasp the concept of asserting on sender + chainid more than asserting on unaliased address.\r\n\r\nOne upside of aliasing is that an aliased owned contract may not be obvious on which domain the owner resides until it is called once. It produces a completely unique account that commits to an account on a particular domain. Developers can build an aliasing scheme on top of the messenger if they so desire.\r\n\r\n### User Stories\r\n\r\nI am a smart contract developer that has a cross chain app. I have a single contract on OP Mainnet that owns a contract on Base. I want to ensure that only the contract on OP Mainnet can call permissioned functions on the contract on Base. Since there may exist other contracts on other chains that have the same address as my contract on OP Mainnet, I need to check 2 things. The address is correct and the originating domain is correct.\r\n\r\nI am a smart contract dev that has a cross chain app with a deterministically deployed contract across all chains. I can be sure that I own the account on all chains since it is deterministically deployed. I just need to check that the address is correct.", "CLOSED", 0, "tynes", "2024-03-01T17:14:28Z", "2024-04-15T20:23:02Z", "2024-04-15T20:15:05Z", "ethereum-optimism/specs", "2025-08-30 10:57:01"]

Is it possible to bridge an ethereum erc-20 to Base, where the new token on Base has a different name and ticker? I see the instructions say \"Token name, symbol, and decimals matches on-chain data (auto-reject); If overrides are used (requires manual review)\" which suggests this might be possible upon review.\r\n\r\nI'm part of a renounced contract project which was taken over by the community 2 years ago after the original dev abandoned it. We have now built a product and are in a good position at multi million mcap and with a dedicated community. However, during our evolution we decided to rebrand away from the original name and ticker. We'd like to rebrand with a new name and ticker on Base but keep it linked to our existing renounced liquidity pool so as not to adversely affect current holders. It would be perfect if this could be achieved via the standard bridge.\r\n\r\nTagging @cfluke-cb as Base reviewer. Furthermore, if this is possible, what steps could we take to be listed on the official Base bridging UI? We have a professional product which we'd like to bring to Base and it would help us a lot to be listed in the UI.

A blockchain has inputs and outputs. The inputs to an OP Stack chain are all of the L1 data which is then mapped into execution payloads via the derivation pipeline. These execution payloads are inputs to the state transition function which ultimately produces the outputs, represented as the state root and execution logs.\r\n\r\nIf an aggregation service was scanning L1 to look for the inputs to the derivation function, it should be possible to identify the next set of inputs and then pass them to [kona](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/kona) running in [sp1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1) to generate a zkp. How would we know that its the full set of inputs? For example, a single `TransactionDeposited` event could be missing which would result in the wrong state. This may mean that the zkvm would need to do the full derivation process, ie actually observe all possible L1 data. This adds a lot of extra work for the zkvm to do, so what is the minimal amount of work that the zkvm actually has to do?\r\n\r\nOnce the proof is generated, then its possible to aggregate the proofs together. This could enable \"super transactions\" as noted by [Justin Drake](https://youtu.be/URCH2d1cdyg?si=1UMaP9BINbVESmfU). A super transaction is a transaction that executes across multiple rollups \"synchronously\", you can think of it as a bundle of regular transactions that are each individually signed for single chains but make up the full intention of the user.

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen switching Data Availability layers, there can be a temporary connection error fetching frame data corresponding to the frame pointer posted on ethereum. Right now ethereum related temporary errors are handled by passing `TemporaryError` for e.g. in `DataSource.Next`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Next returns the next piece of data if it has it. If the constructor failed, this\r\n// will attempt to reinitialize itself. If it cannot find the block it returns a ResetError\r\n// otherwise it returns a temporary error if fetching the block returns an error.\r\nfunc (ds *DataSource) Next(ctx context.Context) (eth.Data, error) {\r\n                ...\r\n\t\t} else if errors.Is(err, ethereum.NotFound) {\r\n\t\t\treturn nil, NewResetError(fmt.Errorf(\"failed to open calldata source: %w\", err))\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\treturn nil, NewTemporaryError(fmt.Errorf(\"failed to open calldata source: %w\", err))\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if `DataFromEVMTransactions` also returned an error, so that the caller could wrap it in a `TemporaryError`, similar to the above caller. This way, temporary errors from resolving the frame data from the pointer would be handled gracefully and retried. Right now there is no way for an alternate Data Availability layer resolving frame data from the pointer to signal that there's a temporary error and the caller _must_ retry. Hence, the suggestion is to simply add `error` to the function signature:\r\n\r\n`func DataFromEVMTransactions(config *rollup.Config, daCfg *rollup.DAConfig, batcherAddr common.Address, txs types.Transactions, log log.Logger) []eth.Data {`\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n`func DataFromEVMTransactions(config *rollup.Config, daCfg *rollup.DAConfig, batcherAddr common.Address, txs types.Transactions, log log.Logger) ([]eth.Data, error) {`\r\n\r\nand have the caller return a wrapped temporary error in case of a connection error to the Data Availability layer.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nAs an alternative the Data Availability layer can maintain a fork of the same code with this error plugged in, however it would be very helpful to have this handled upstream so that an integration would be easier in the future, for e.g. with an interface.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis would be a small function signature change for upstream but it would be really helpful in keeping the forks easier to maintain.", "CLOSED", 0, "tuxcanfly", "2023-05-09T22:34:39Z", "2024-05-09T09:40:16Z", "2024-05-09T09:40:16Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-30 13:07:55"]

Some applications may be opinionated about the types of features or blockspace they accept inbound messages from in the world of interop. This means that legibility is important when there is interoperability between chains that have non fungible blockspace.\r\n\r\nAn example of non fungible blockspace is a plasma chain vs a rollup. The security properties of the chains are completely different, therefore some applications may want to be able to introspect in on the properties of the originating chain to know how to treat the messages.\r\n\r\nOne way to allow for legibility into the type of blockspace is having a `bytes32` bitfield on L1 that includes all of the features for a chain.

This adds complexity to consensus, as now there would have to be a special case for each of the special predeploys. There are only so many predeploy spots and it means adding a new type of blockspace or a new feature would require the addition of a new predeploy to allow for them to interop.

This reminded me of the recent Polygon Heimdal issue w/ event processing outlined here: https://www.asymmetric.re/blog/polygon-log-confusion\r\n\r\nThe TLDR of the issue is that if you don\u2019t fully account for every byte in the event when processing it you leave yourself open to an attacker possibly being able to craft a malicious event that passes your parsing logic when it shouldn\u2019t.  In the polygon example this happened off-chain in the sequencer, but the same general type of flaw could exist in a contract, or in this case possibly the `CrossL2Inbox` predeploy.\r\n\r\nMy concern is that the `Message Payload` is just a concatenation of the log fields, and that the `Message Identifer` doesn't include either a byte length or full hash or other exhaustive check of said payload.  As such, I _think_ its possible to craft an alternative message payload with say additional topics and pass that to `executeMessage` possibly leading the emission of a \"spoofed\" `ExecutingMessage` event for a different initiating message than intended.\r\n\r\nThis would involve something like a malicious user emitting two very similar looking initiating messages, say one with `LOG1` and a second using `LOG2` that contains the same first topic (due to the current payload serialization format this would only work if the event only contained topics and no data).\r\n\r\nAs I said I can't think of an actual attack with this yet, but wanted to highlight it as something that made my spider sense tingle a little when reading the spec.\r\n ", "OPEN", 0, "ryanschneider", "2024-05-24T23:05:57Z", "2024-05-27T19:45:51Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/specs", "2025-08-30 14:12:46"]

This EOA is controlled by the [op-batcher](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-batcher), which is responsible for publishing the data to L1. A batch is only [considered canonical](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/c4226bf4a809006adaa7087477db466e2eda2030/op-node/rollup/derive/data_source.go#L93) if it is from the batcher key and to the [batch inbox](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/c4226bf4a809006adaa7087477db466e2eda2030/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/SystemConfig.sol#L187) contract.\r\n\r\nThis design is simple but is not super flexible. Since it must be an EOA, batches cannot be submitted using a smart contract wallet. It is also not possible to arbitrarily program batch validity rules. If we modified the batch inbox to be a smart contract, a canonical batch could be decided by an event emitted by the smart contract.\r\n\r\nUsing a smart contract event to determine batch validity would allow developers to permissionlessly innovate on leader election mechanisms. It could be possible to build a simple round robin scheme to enable a more decentralized sequencer, where different sequencers can be allowed to submit the next set of batches. It would also be possible to build an attestation network that can hook into the batch validity rules where a batch is only considered canonical if enough of the attesters signed off on the batch.\r\n\r\nIn practice an event definition would need to be defined that would signal to the `op-node` that the transaction includes a valid batch. As long the configured batch inbox emitted this event, then the `op-node` would know to interpret the batch as valid and attempt to process it further.

If I'm right, the problem arises from logical precedence being lost when messages are passed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is supposed to be addressed at a higher level of abstraction that I'm not anticipating. Apologies if that's the case - I am but a researchoor.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nConsider two blocks produced at the same timestamp by a malicious sequencer. Block A containing transaction T_a and block B containing transaction T_b.\r\n\r\n#### Abstractly the attack runs like this:\r\n* T_b reads an initiating message, m_a, from A which is a prerequisite to it emitting an initiating message, m_b. \r\n* T_a reads m_b from B which is a prerequisite for it emitting m_a. \r\n\r\nThe transactions would not be valid if executed sequentially, but they are when done on different chains in the superchain.\r\n\r\n#### A more concrete attack:\r\nOn chain A there is a contract which allows anyone holding an NFT in collection C to mint another NFT in collection C, otherwise they can be bought for 10 Eth. Assume that no NFTs have been minted in the collection yet.\r\n* T_b reads an initiating message, m_a, from A which transfers an NFT in C to the attacker on B.\r\n* T_b emits m_b that transfers the NFT to A.\r\n* T_a reads m_b and uses ownership of the NFT to mint another NFT in C.\r\n* T_a emits m_a which bridges the new NFT to B\r\n\r\nT_a is valid since it depends on m_b which is emitted on B and similarly T_b is valid since it depends only on m_a being emitted which it is - i.e. the attacker can bridge an NFT from B to A because it received the NFT via m_a.\r\n\r\nBefore the attack, the attacker didn't own an NFT and after the attack they do despite them not paying. Without the message passing protocol this wouldn't have been possible even with loans since no NFT existed before. \r\n \r\n\r\nI realise this specific attack can be defended against at the smart contract level, but I thought I'd raise it since, from my understanding, this is a new problem opened up by synchronous message passing and might apply quite widely. \r\n\r\n", "OPEN", 0, "quintuskilbourn", "2024-05-24T22:22:35Z", "2024-06-05T19:12:23Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/specs", "2025-08-30 14:15:03"]

The current convention (not requirement) for the batch inbox address is `0xFF00...{chainId}`. These are not compatible, as the batch inbox address only can fit chain IDs up to 19 bytes because addresses are 20 bytes. \r\n\r\n**This is currently not a big problem, and this issue is low priority**, because:\r\n1. The batch inbox address is only a convention, so chains with chain IDs larger than 19 bytes can choose an arbitrary batch inbox address. But we don't yet spec out what requirements (if any) that address should have.\r\n2. From my research, no chain IDs are currently large enough for this to be a problem. However, some OP Stack chains do not follow the batch inbox convention anyway.\r\n\r\nSo one consideration here is: should we enforce a batch inbox convention? Doing so would be a nice property, and we may want to spec out the required work to make this convention into a requirement.\r\n\r\nRegardless, possible solutions to the existing incompatbility are discussed below:\r\n\r\n## Shrink max allowable chain ID\r\n\r\n[EIP-2294](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2294) proposed a max chain ID of `floor(MAX_UINT64 / 2) - 36`. This value was chosen to prevent overflow of a uint64 when calculating the v-component of a signature as `{0,1} + CHAIN_ID * 2 + 35` per [EIP-155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155). Many popular tools, like MetaMask, [only support](https://gist.github.com/rekmarks/a47bd5f2525936c4b8eee31a16345553) chain IDs that are within the javascript `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` based on the same v-component calculation (resulting in ~4e15, below this proposed max).\r\n\r\nThis is my preferred solution because (1) it fixes the issue with minimal work, (2) mitigates the risk of OP Stack chains not supporting popular tools, and (3) can be expanded to a larger value in the future when needed.\r\n\r\nA factor in this proposal becoming stagnant was because it prevents an easy way for chains to pick a unique chain ID through a process like `keccak256(\"myUniqueChainName\")`. This is a good point, but we already do not do this, and we can expand allowable chain ID and change the convention in the future if this becomes necessary/desirable.\r\n\r\n## Change Batch Inbox Convention\r\n\r\nSince we only have 20 bytes to work with, the new batch inbox address convention have to be something like `keccak256(schemeVersion, chainId)[:20]`. This would require changes to op-node so it can read from two batch inbox addresses: the legacy address, and a new address. It also makes it harder to look at a batch inbox address and back out the chain it's for, but this can is solved by the superchain-registry anyway\r\n\r\n## Do Nothing\r\n\r\nBecause this is just a convention, and not enforced, the status quo is ok\u2014for chains that cannot meet the convention, they just choose a different, arbitrary batch inbox address. This should still be documented in the spec somewhere, e.g. in this case does the address still need to start with `0xFF`?\r\n\r\n", "CLOSED", 0, "mds1", "2024-03-15T22:59:39Z", "2024-06-20T23:30:47Z", "2024-06-20T23:30:47Z", "ethereum-optimism/specs", "2025-08-30 15:20:02"]

Please describe.**\r\nWhen it comes to updating the L2, the `L1Block` is regularly called to update its' state values, including the L1 block hash.  This hash is extremely valuable as a user can create a proof for any state of the L1 at the current block hash.\r\n\r\nThe issue arises when dealing with historical data.  As we are only ever using the most-recent hash within `L1Block`, we are unable to prove L1 state at a historical point in time on-chain without deploying our own contract with manually-synced block hashes.\r\n\r\nThe value of a chain is derived by the value of its' state.

This owner has sole access to upgrade the proxy.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nIt is impossible for a deployer to atomically initialize proxy storage upon proxy creation if the proxy is designated to be owned by another address (ie. msig).  This introduces technical debt for op-stack chains who want to follow upgrades with top notch security.\r\n\r\nBy design, every proxy is designated to be initialized with an implementation.  Therefore, we should be able to create the proxy, set the owner, AND upgrade the proxy within one execution trace.\r\n\r\nI propose the team creates a Proxy singleton which creates and initializes the proxy from a single function call.

Please describe.**\r\nAs a node operator, I would like an option to be able to use a Subgraph to connect the `op-node` for retrieving blob data.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n1. Add a New Configuration Option:\r\n    - Allow users to specify a GraphQL API endpoint for retrieving blob data using either a command-line flag (`-l1.beacon-graphql`) or an environment variable (`L1_BEACON_GRAPHQL`).\r\n2. Implement Startup Validation:\r\n    - At startup, check that the provided GraphQL endpoint is compatible with your system. Use GraphQL's introspection feature to verify that the API has all the necessary fields required by `op-node`.\r\n3. Create a Method to Query the API:\r\n    - Develop a method that uses the provided GraphQL endpoint to fetch blob data for specific `block_id`s. This method should be similar to the existing `[GetBlobSidecars](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-service/sources/l1_beacon_client.go#L221-L222)` but tailored for GraphQL.\r\n\r\nThe [Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/AEwmTRZrEdrmsoRLvkXmXgP2q7TvcMVcCdGQUY8Cp6Mm?view=Playground&chain=arbitrum-one) we built at the Graph returns a structure similar to the `/eth/v1/beacon/blob_sidecars/{block_id}`. Based on my research of the current implementation of `GetBlobSidecars`, the subgraph does return all the fields necessary, but let me know if there are other fields I might have missed that we need to integrate so we can update the schema. \r\n\r\n```graphql\r\ntype Blob {\r\n id: ID!\r\n index: Int!\r\n blob: Bytes!\r\n kzg_commitment: Bytes!\r\n kzg_proof: Bytes!\r\n kzg_commitment_inclusion_proof: [Bytes!]!\r\n slot: Slot!\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Slot {\r\n id: ID!\r\n number: BigInt!\r\n spec: String!\r\n proposer_index: Int!\r\n parent_root: Bytes!\r\n state_root: Bytes!\r\n body_root: Bytes!\r\n signature: Bytes!\r\n timestamp: String!\r\n blobs(\r\n  skip: Int = 0\r\n  first: Int = 100\r\n  orderBy: Blob_orderBy\r\n  orderDirection: OrderDirection\r\n  where: Blob_filter\r\n  block: Block_height\r\n ): [Blob!]!\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Query {\r\n  blob(\r\n    id: ID!\r\n    block: Block_height\r\n  ): Blob\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n- Learn more about how to use The Graph for retrieving blobs https://thegraph.com/blog/eip-4844-blobs-data/\r\n- Try out this subgraph to retrieve blob data https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/AEwmTRZrEdrmsoRLvkXmXgP2q7TvcMVcCdGQUY8Cp6Mm?view=Playground&chain=arbitrum-one\r\n- I'm an engineer with The Guild, a core dev team at The Graph specializing on GraphQL API and Developer Tooling.

Then I launch the devnet using `make devnet-up` and make some adjustments in the bundler code: change all relevant target ports from 8545 to 9545 and in the 2-deploy-entrypoint.ts file comment out the code that checks that `chainId` is either 1337 or 31337, since it is actually 901.\r\n\r\nBut when I run `yarn hardhat-deploy --network localhost` to deploy the entrypoint, I get \"Insufficient funds\" error.\r\n\r\nI think I need to change some private key-related settings of the devnet, but I'm not sure which ones.

The network may return to health if the sequencer can start submitting batches built from this new implicitly derived head.\r\nIf a chain increases the window size to 24 hours, that network should simply operate with that higher limit. Nodes would wait twice as long before reorging out unsafe blocks, and the batcher could wait twice as long before submitting a batch. I don't think there's anything in code which makes assumptions on 12h window. Having said that, the change may have effects which are undesirable:\r\nNodes reorging out 24h of blocks could be harder on those nodes, causing more to hit resource constraints or otherwise fail\r\nBatcher submitting half as often could lead to difficulty processing large batches\r\nFor high throughput chains, the batch submission rate tends to be controlled by fullness rather than timing\r\nPerhaps other timing windows would have to be similarly adjusted? Like, maybe Fault Proofs would need a larger window? Not sure about this.\r\nThere's a question here about why someone would want a 24h sequencing window. 12h is already very large, and doubling it doesn't have any advantages I'm aware of. A chain operator does not want to flirt with the window, for risk of causing a massive unsafe head reorg, so the difference between 12h and 24h is not very meaningful to me.\r\nAs for if it's a requirement, a standard, a recommendation, or just a default, I leave that to the interpretation of our guides and you excellent solutions engineer folks.\r\nFinally, how to change the window size -- looks like sequencerWindowSize is part of deployment configurations, which are set up at the same time as things like ChainID. It's not clear to me if there's a way to modify the value in the L1 system config. I suspect this value is hard to change once set.", "CLOSED", 0, "sbvegan", "2024-07-11T18:01:54Z", "2024-07-26T18:45:30Z", "2024-07-26T18:45:30Z", "ethereum-optimism/docs", "2025-08-30 17:32:45"]

This started happening after we added the ability to import L2 state using `loadAllocs(string)`. `forge-std` has a method `assumeNoPrecompiles` [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/blob/2f112697506eab12d433a65fdc31a639548fe365/src/StdCheats.sol#L317) that we should be using. If this doesn't fix the flakes, we may also need to implement an addition to `assumeNoPrecompiles` that also avoids calling the L2 implementations. Another solution would be to move the L1 contracts and L2 contracts into their own \"chains\" and be deliberate about switching between chains when interacting with the two.

And the deployed contracts would all have addresses that depend on this test deployer account and nonce. The deployer test script contract itself should wipe itself as part of the Allocs L1 output routine. Somewhere in there it also sets the pre funded accounts. And in either routine it might end up with the nonce reset.

Also, even if I start op-batcher afterwards and let it send Batch TX, the L2 safe/finalized head does not catch up to the latest block.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\n1. Deploy OPStack v1.7.6 on Sepolia testnet\r\n1. Start op-geth, op-node, op-batcher on the L2 node\r\n1. Services will be operational for about a week. The safe head is about  300 blocks behind, and the finalized head is about 800 blocks behind.\r\n1. Stop op-batcher and wait a one day\r\n1. op-geth and op-node output the log of reorganization\r\n1. Start op-batcher\r\n1. Can confirm that safe/finalized head keeps delaying\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI want the safe/finalized head to catch up with the LATEST block.\r\n\r\n**Environment Information:**\r\n -

It isn't immediately clear if they can without first shipping the devnet and then seeing how much throughput the system can handle safely. After that, it should be more clear where the bottlenecks are and then we can benchmark various ways of integrating zkps into the protocol if necessary.\r\n\r\nRight now it is assumed that there will be heavy load in unsafe to safe progression described in the [derivation pipeline](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/interop/verifier.md#derivation-pipeline) - the problem can be modeled using a [graph](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/interop/messaging.md#message-graph). There will also be heavy load for the sequencer when accepting incoming transactions to [build blocks](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/interop/sequencer.md#block-building).\r\n\r\nThese are two different problems and zkps can be applied for both.\r\n\r\nFor unsafe to safe progression, the sequencer could send proofs via the p2p network so that the derivation pipeline doesn't need to query for as much remote data. This idea has been explored in by adding a [commitment](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/259) to the L2 blocks themselves and sending the proofs via [p2p](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/interop/rollup_node_p2p.md). This solution doesn't require zkps but there could be a way to improve our current thinking with them.\r\n\r\nFor the sequencer accepting transactions, the a zkp could be given to the sequencer along with the user's transaction that removes the need for the sequencer to verify the existence of the initiating message before including in a block. This seems like a more promising application, although it isn't immediately clear if this would be a huge gain given the state of zkp proof generation times. Given slight spec changes, it may be possible to make the proof generation times fast enough for this to work. Instead of using an absolute log index, a tx index + relative log index can be used in the identifier and it will greatly speed up zkp proof generation time.\r\n\r\nAn example of using sp1 for the sort of proof that is required for these solutions can be found here: https://github.com/puma314/verified-logs/\r\n\r\nWe also need to be very mindful of the downsides if people are able to create fraudulent proofs.

For details, see commits [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/11188/commits/4fd9c3917baf9c17d1642576d73eea53616cc440) and [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/11188/commits/9e80acf4a653b068d490e187baa2e3cf1c38c672).  The original approached directly overwrote the`MemProfileRate` symbol in the compiled MIPS bytecode in order to disable memory profiling for performance reasons.  The current approach sets `runtime.MemProfileRate` in the op-program itself, which is less hacky, but has the disadvantage that any go program we want to run needs to separately ensure that mem profiling is disabled. \r\n\r\nThe suggested approach is to move the memprofile handling back to `patch.go` and out of op-program, but to handle this in a cleaner way by setting an envar on the initial program stack.  You can see where the initial stacks envars are set up in `PatchStack()` [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/05a9c478264302a257f30daad877449a31b0aaeb/cannon/mipsevm/program/patch.go#L74).  For documentation on the initial stack see this [MIPS ABI documentation](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/mipsabi.pdf) \"Figure 3-26: Initial Process Stack\" . The envar set is currently empty, but we can push the value `GODEBUG=memprofilerate=0` in order to inform the runtime to disable mem profiling.

What does this mean in practice?\r\n\r\nUsers can deposit `ether` between an arbitrary number of `OptimismPortal` contracts into the set of interoperable chains. The current scope of interop does not unify this liquidity on L1. Users are able to send the `ether` between various L2 chains and must check that there is liquidity in the `OptimismPortal` that corresponds to their L2 before withdrawing to L1. A race condition exists in which the user initiates their withdrawal and then is frontran by another withdrawal that removes the liquidity from the `OptimismPortal`. The cannot get their funds back to L2 and must wait for more deposits until their withdrawal can be processed.\r\n\r\nIf we want to guarantee solvency of withdrawals, there are 2 known approaches:\r\n- L2 reverts on no liquidity\r\n- L1 unified liquidity\r\n\r\n## L2 Reverts\r\n\r\nThis solution involves tracking the balance of the `OptimismPortal` in L2 and incrementing and decrementing the value as there are deposits and withdrawals. A one time upgrade transaction is included in a hardfork that uses the balance of the `OptimismPortal` as an input to generate an upgrade transaction that sets the value in an L2 storage slot. The L1 attributes transaction then includes a sum of the `mint` fields in all deposits and that increments the balance. When a user calls `L2ToL1MessagePasser.initiateWithdrawal`, it decrements the balance and reverts on underflow. This prevents withdrawals on L2 by a revert if there is insufficient liquidity.\r\n\r\nThis balance accumulator on L2 is not an accurate counter for the amount of `ether` on the L2. It is just meant to observe the liquidity for withdrawals. The invariant `address(OptimismPortal).balance >= L2 view of balance` must hold.\r\n- It is possible to transfer `ether` to the `OptimismPortal` without minting it on L2 by calling the `donateETH` function or by using `SELFDESTRUCT` to move `ether` without EVM execution.\r\n- L2 to L2 cross chain messaging of `ether` will not modify the balance\r\n\r\nThe semantics here also need to account for custom gas token chains, which could be solved by coupling an `eth_call` to `OptimismPortal.balance` rather than reading its balance from the state directly, but that would require L1 EVM execution to be in the fault proof.\r\n\r\n## L1 Unified Liquidity\r\n\r\nThe most minimal version of a L1 unified bridge is one where there is a shared lockbox. This involves each `OptimismPortal` migrating its `ether` balance to a single contract. Any new deposit would forward the `ether` here and any withdrawal would remove `ether` from here. This creates a shared liquidity pool for the set of interoperable chains.\r\n\r\nThere are open questions around the specific design of the shared lockbox. It cannot be permissionless to join unless the contracts were deployed by OP Stack Manager or older systems have had history integrity checks, then we know for a fact that the L2 system doesn't have a backdoor in its contracts.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\nThese solutions do not solve for ERC20 tokens.", "OPEN", 0, "tynes", "2024-09-05T04:18:07Z", "2024-09-06T01:57:39Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/specs", "2025-08-30 19:48:19"]

I'm always frustrated when [...]\r\n\r\nRight now there is not a great way to do L2 contracts releases because there is network specific configuration in the L2 genesis allocs in the form of storage and bytecode (immutables). This makes it difficult to release an `allocs.json` artifact as a release of the L2 genesis, as well as ensuring that no malicious code has been set in the genesis state of a chain. Ideally there should be a single deterministic L2 genesis state per hardfork and all network specific config should be sourced from L1.\r\n\r\nThis project involves moving all of the network specific configuration in the L2 predeploys to be sourced from L1. We want a system similar to interop's `setConfig` as described [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/122#issuecomment-2272191134) that sets the network specific values into storage via deposit transactions when the `SystemConfig` is initialized.\r\n\r\nExamples of this network specific config:\r\n- [L2StandardBridge.otherBridge](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/1dbe9d829361b65320c64a8512b0e82898bd6b05/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2StandardBridge.sol#L65)\r\n- [L2CrossDomainMessenger.otherMessenger](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/1dbe9d829361b65320c64a8512b0e82898bd6b05/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L31)\r\n- [FeeVault config](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/1dbe9d829361b65320c64a8512b0e82898bd6b05/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L1FeeVault.sol#L21), for each of the 3 fee vaults\r\n- L2 ProxyAdmin owner\r\n\r\nInstead of reading these values from storage on L2, they could be exposed via getters on the `L1Block` contract and then read from a single source of truth. The L1 `setConfig` path would be able to issue deposit transactions that can modify these values. This would decouple the L2 genesis state from network specific config and simplify the process of spinning up a new chain because all chains can use the same `allocs.json`", "CLOSED", 0, "tynes", "2024-08-21T21:32:30Z", "2024-09-18T16:17:04Z", "2024-09-18T16:17:04Z", "ethereum-optimism/specs", "2025-08-30 20:53:12"]

This would allow for an optimization within the proof programs where they no longer need to observe and filter all logs to guarantee that they have the full set of logs. A witness can be used to populate the logs and the program can check that the nonces all line up to guarantee that the complete set of logs are present within the program.\r\n\r\nThere are currently 2 logs that impact consensus:\r\n- `TransactionDeposited` from the `OptimismPortal`\r\n- `ConfigUpdated` from the `SystemConfig`\r\n\r\n## TransactionDeposited\r\n\r\nWe could have a nonce on L1 and on L2 and keep them up to date, this could be generally useful to know how many deposits have yet to be processed by offchain software. If we want to hold the invariant that $$L1nonce <= L2nonce$$ then we would need to add the number of deposits inbound in the L1 attributes transaction, since there would be a race condition with upgrading the contracts for existing chains if we simply incremented on L2. This would require a new deposit version and the accumulator would in the L1 attributes transaction would only count deposits that are of the new version\r\n\r\n## ConfigUpdated\r\n\r\nI think that these events can be removed completely from consensus given we follow the pattern designed in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/122 and a generic form of [this](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/b0363e747bd1b3411e72aef07de4de41ddbd6773/specs/experimental/custom-gas-token.md#setgaspayingtoken)", "OPEN", 0, "tynes", "2024-08-13T19:04:52Z", "2024-09-17T00:46:17Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/specs", "2025-08-30 20:53:12"]

Some fields are guaranteed to change every L2 block like the sequence number, some fields change every time the L1 origin updates (L1 blocknumber, L1 timestamp, etc) and some fields only change based on chain operator input (batcher hash). \r\n\r\nFor the fields that change automatically based on the L1 origin, we can call those dynamic values. For the values that only change based on chain operator input, we can call those static values.\r\n\r\nThe custom gas token spec adds a new static value which is the address of the ERC20 that represents the gas paying asset for the L2. A new design pattern is followed where the value is set in the system config and then it triggers a special deposit transaction that is able to set the address directly in the L2's L1Block predeploy. This pattern can be made more generic to work with all static values.\r\n\r\nThe next time that we need to add a static value to the L1 Attributes transaction, we should:\r\n- Make a generic pipeline that is very similar to the way that custom gas token deposits its information into L2\r\n- Remove all static values from the L1 attributes transaction and instead allow them to be configured \"just in time\" by the generic pipeline\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to easily allow for the configuration of the batch inbox for example", "OPEN", 0, "tynes", "2024-04-11T15:29:39Z", "2024-09-17T01:09:54Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/specs", "2025-08-30 20:53:12"]

A tool that can be used to manage semver would be very helpful here, it should be expected to be able to list the semver of all of the contracts as well as automatically bump semver of contracts in different ways (patch, minor, major, beta).\r\n\r\nThere would be a few commands like `list`, `bump <contract name> <type>` where it would automatically modify the source code of the contract directly and `release` where it would accept a list of candidate contracts to release and automatically remove the `beta` tag.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways to think about the `list` command. My thinking is that it should work on the foundry artifacts rather than the source code, since we publish artifacts as releases. This command has a few ways that it could operate. All solutions likely involve a first step where the ABIs are scanned through, looking for contracts that implement `IVersion`\r\n- ~~Look through the source code directly of the contracts for the `IVersion` and use string parsing to pull out the version.~~ The source code is not included in the artifacts, perhaps the `build-info` but its difficult to work with that file\r\n- Embed the deployed bytecode in a stateless EVM and perform a single call to get the version\r\n- Look at the natspec docs in the compiler output\r\nI think its best to not look at the natspec since a bug could result in 2 different values, plus this will not work for the feature contracts that extend the base contracts since the real semver lives in the base.

This should not be a problem as these are not upgradable contracts. We will never be able to perform a storage migration on these contracts. As long as the public ABI is preserved, it should be perfectly fine for the storage layout to change.\r\n- The ABI changes via the removal of `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance`. These methods are not recommended to be used and are not part of the ERC20 standard, see discussion in https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/4583. We could easily port the removed code and tests from solady to the implementation of `OptimismMintableERC20` token from https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/pull/602\r\n- Audit coverage: The solady ERC20 implementation has been audited [here](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/main/audits/cantina-solady-report.pdf). The version used by the monorepo has no diff in the ERC20 implementation compared to the audit\r\n- CREATE2 usage when deploying `OptimismMintableERC20` tokens will result in different address creation. This is a known issue already as the bytecode has changed many times in the past. This is why we are using CREATE3 for the `OptimismMintableSuperchainERC20`. Our mental models around management of the factory deployed tokens already takes into account non standard create2 usage\r\n\r\nThe following diff is on top of

Modification of the `op-node` derivation process: The `op-node` will be updated to exclude failed batch transactions during the derivation process. This change ensures that only successfully executed batch transactions are processed and included in the derived state. \r\n3.

I mentioned this before, then I saw there is a pr related to this: #11171 \r\n    2. but in the above pr, it just modify the checking stage for deploy-config, when load the rollup.json file, the checking is still existing, it still requires the challengewindow can not be zero:\r\n        https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/ddc37daa49558c2fb5c1a92e694eeb7de5942e00/op-node/rollup/types.go#L503-L508\r\n2. In op-node logic, it still uses all code related to `KeccakCommitment` even for now we already use `GenericCommitment`, even the \"challenge\" concept is not existed for `GenericCommitment`:\r\n    https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/ddc37daa49558c2fb5c1a92e694eeb7de5942e00/op-plasma/damgr.go#L193-L260\r\n    When we choose `GenericCommitment`, in deploy script it would not deploy the DaChallenge Contract, but the following logic is strange:\r\n    1. in L198, the contract should empty or some unexisted address, but it does not need to fetch the challenge status, those logic comes from `KeccakCommitment`, and also for the following check like L200, and L207 op also does not need to add the commitment into track for we do not need to wait challenge time.\r\n    2. for L198, this logic can work when use `KeccakCommitment`, is more like a trick. it can work just because it return `ChallengeUninitialized`, so the following logic give green light and not return error. But those logic is related to `KeccakCommitment`, for `GenericCommitment` is semantic ambiguity\r\n    As a conclusion, if `GenericCommitment` does not have the concept related to \"ChallengeDA\", this part need to refactor.\r\n3. When try to migrate from `KeccakCommitment` to `GenericCommitment`:\r\n    For L195, we see it check the commitment type with the value from `rollup.json`. For exsiting seqeuencer and fullnode, but be we can see the fianlity is stuck, then we can modify the rollup.json, change type from `KeccakCommitment` to `GenericCommitment` and set challengewindow/resolvewindow to 0 and restart.\r\n    But when new syncing node from genesis, especially when syncing mode is `consensus-layer` in op-node, it must require the guy to set `keccakCommitment` in rollup.json first, and when he see the finality is stuck can contain those error log, then recover to `GenericCommitment` and restart. \r\n    So it's necessary for this check at here, can we consider to remove it so that for migration is more smooth?\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n1. we hope the challengewindow can be 0 when choose `GenericCommitment`\r\n2. when use `GenericCommitment`, do not be involved into the challenge da logic.\r\n3. for migration from  `KeccakCommitment` to `GenericCommitment`, we do not hope the new syncing node need to modify rollup.json and restart, just use the newest rollup.json is ok.\r\n\r\n**Environment Information:**\r\n - Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n - Package Version (or commit hash): op-node v1.8.0-rc.2\r\n\r\n", "OPEN", 0, "atenjin", "2024-07-19T14:43:08Z", "2024-09-11T14:10:37Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-30 20:53:59"]

Deposits are force include and invalid executing messages are reorg'd out, so this means an attacker would be able to force reorgs on the chain. There are a [few solutions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10867#issuecomment-2183111697) to this problem, but we need to research them and there are higher priority things in the short term.\n\n## Design\nWe want to ban deposit transactions completely from triggering executing messages to prevent this attack in the short term. We can reenable them in the future (after mainnet release via another hardfork). The design that we have come to consensus on is as follows:\n- add an `isDeposit()(bool)` function to `L1Block`\n- add a new function `L1Block.setL1BlockValuesInterop` that sets `isDeposit = true` then calls `setL1BlockValuesEcotone`\n- add a new function `depositsComplete()` which sets `isDeposit = false`\n- add a new deposit tx to derivation pipeline that calls `depositsComplete()`\n- the `CrossL2Inbox` does `require(L1Block.isDeposit() == false)` \n\n~~It was determined in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10870 that there was a missing edge case with deposit handling in the context of interop without the \"only EOA\" invariant. The semantics are being defined in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/13 but it was decided that we should not implement this as part of the devnet release and instead just ban deposits that trigger executing messages completely.~~\n\n~~The only way to do this reliably is by hacking into the state transition function. Since we don't have an explicit goal of being multiclient and we want to run the devnet to see how stable our software is, we can modify the STF temporarily to ban deposits and then remove this hack when we have a proper solution implemented.~~\n\n~~An easy way to hack this solution is to hook into someplace around [applyTransaction](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/blob/5838916e90da70c6c28f6a80d5042156ca6e2a74/core/state_processor.go#L108) and revert deposit transactions that trigger an executing message event.~~\n\n~~While this code is temporary and not going to live forever, it will help us in the short term be able to reliably test the end to end flow of the system on a devnet.~~\n\n", "CLOSED", 0, "tynes", "2024-05-20T18:50:05Z", "2024-09-11T03:22:26Z", "2024-09-11T03:22:26Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-30 20:53:59"]

The complication is that most of the tests are in the monorepo and we want to see them passing before actually merging the update into op-geth optimism branch.\n\n## Prep op-geth PR\n\nCreate a new branch from the latest `optimism` branch in `op-geth` same as usual for a PR.\n\nMerge in the changes from the new upstream release, e.g:\n\n```bash\ngit remote add upstream \"https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum.git\"\ngit fetch upstream\ngit merge \"v1.11.5\" # Adjust for whatever the latest geth release tag is\n```\n\nResolve any merge conflicts and create a draft PR.\n\n### Update fork.yaml\n\nIn the op-geth repo, update the `base` \u2192 `hash` value in `fork.yaml` so that [https://op-geth.optimism.io/](https://op-geth.optimism.io/) only shows differences from the new upstream commit. The new hash is the commit hash of the upstream tag that was just merged in.\n\nInclude this change as part of the PR to merge changes into op-geth.\n\n## Prep Monorepo PR\n\nCreate a new branch in the `optimism` monorepo off the `develop` branch same as usual for a PR.\n\nUpdate the version of `op-geth` used. While you can do this by changing the `replace` line in `./go.mod` to point to your local checkout of `op-geth` we want to take advantage of CI to run some tests so we\u2019ll temporarily update it to point to the branch we created the PR from in `op-geth`.\n\n### With go mod edit\n\n```bash\ngo mod edit \\\n  -replace github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum@v1.11.4=github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth@<COMMIT>\ngo mod tidy\n```\n\nReplace  `<COMMIT>` with the commit hash of the latest commit from your `op-geth` branch. Run this again in the `indexer` directory to also update op-geth in the indexer module. You can use the branch name instead of the commit hash but only if the branch name doesn\u2019t contain any special characters (like `/`).\n\nCommit this and create a draft PR. Then review the CI results and fix any issues.\n\n### Manually Modifying go.mod\n\nI find it easier to just manually modify go.mod.  Find the existing entry for [`github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum`](http://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) and update the current version with the new version of upstream geth. So upgrading from go-ethereum 1.13.4 to 1.13.5:\n\n```jsx\n- github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum v1.13.4\n+ github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum v1.13.5\n```\n\nThen update the `replace` directive for geth at the bottom of the file:\n\n```jsx\n- replace github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum v1.13.4 => github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth v1.101304.2-0.20231114215743-0289fd0504a0\n+ replace github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum v1.13.5 => github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth <COMMIT>\n```\n\nReplace  `<COMMIT>` with the commit hash of the latest commit from your `op-geth` branch. Run this again in the `indexer` directory to also update op-geth in the indexer module. You can use the branch name instead of the commit hash but only if the branch name doesn\u2019t contain any special characters (like `/`).\n\nThen run `go mod tidy`\n\nCommit this and create a draft PR. Then review the CI results and fix any issues.\n\n## Identify relevant changes to command line flags\n\nIf there are any changes to how op-geth must be invoked in our infrastructure, document these in the PR and make devinfra aware of the necessary changes. Be sure that the flag changes are tested in running infrastructure.\n\n## Merge op-geth PR\n\nGet the `op-geth` PR reviewed and merge into the `optimism` branch.\n\n## Update Monorepo PR\n\nNow that the changes are actually merged into op-geth properly, update the `go.mod` in the monorepo again to point to the latest commit on the `optimism` branch of op-geth. The best way to do this is to first create a tag in `op-geth`  and then update the monorepo to use that tag:\n\n```bash\ngit tag v1.101308.0-rc.1\ngit push origin v1.101308.0-rc.1\n# head over to Circle CI to approve the docker build\n```\n\nand\n\n```go\ngo mod edit -replace github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum@v1.13.8=github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth@v1.101308.0-rc.1\n```\n\nThen run `go mod tidy`.\n\nPush that change up (consider amending the previous commit pointing to the branch as we don\u2019t need that in the final history).\n\n## Merge Monorepo PR\n\nFinally, get the monorepo reviewed and merge it in.

Here I write as much context as I can:\r\n\r\n## Cross Safe Maintenance\r\nThe ChainsDB currently has a routine which runs Cross-Safety Maintenance. It attempts to advance the x-safety pointer as far as possible, and updates the value when its done. The x-safety pointer can't go beyond the local-safety pointer.\r\n\r\nIt was here we noticed that cross safety was never advancing, and it appears to be due to the local heads never advancing either.\r\n\r\n## Local Head Pointers\r\nWe expect/desire that there are pointers into the database which represent the local safety of a block of messages. We would want this data to write into the Heads Storage, which holds all these pointers as `index` values into the database (which is why I'm calling them pointers)\r\n\r\nThe current flow is:\r\n\r\n`Chain Monitor` ->\r\n`Head Monitor` ->\r\n`Update Processor` \"callback\"\r\n\r\n** Issue 1**: The Update Processor only has one underlying processor at the moment, the Unsafe Processor. We will need to add processors to the Safe and Finalized stages in order to process those updates *at all*.\r\n\r\nInside this underlying `unsafeBlockProcessor` (of type `HeadUpdateProcessor`) we have a notion of which *block number* we are on for the sake of making the right data requests. Once we get all the blocks, we unroll them into their receipts and logs, and append them all to the database.\r\n\r\n**Issue 2**: Appending to the database happens in a space where the Heads Storage is totally untracked. Chain Monitors have a `store` (underlying is a `ChainsDB`), so maybe we can use that directly...\r\n\r\nAnother potential solution would be for ChainsDB to maintain local heads asynchronously, in the same way as it maintains x-heads.

The solution is to allow for batched L1 origin updates, which can be thought of as deriving L2 blocks in batches rather than one by one.\r\n\r\nRight now the L2 derivation pipeline ingests L1 data by observing every L1 block and every L1 transaction in that block. It then builds a set of L2 blocks that \"correspond\" to an L1 block. This set of L2 blocks is called an epoch. The L2 derivation pipeline needs to observe all L1 transactions and logs to make sure that it processed all of the information required for the L2 to correctly sync. This adds a bit of extra overhead to the proof system, but works fine when we consider L1 at 12 second block time and L2 at 2 second block time.\r\n\r\nDue to this epoch based design, there is an assumption that the L2 block time is smaller than the L1 block time. The OP Stack does not currently support sub second block times. \r\n\r\nThis means for the case of L3s deployed on chains with a 1 second block time, they will have trouble operating because of the assumption that the L3 block time is smaller than the L3 block time. If there is any hiccup in the L3 system, it will fall behind due to needing to process each L2 block individually. The way to fix this is to ingest L2 blocks in chunks during L3 derivation rather than one by one. This will allow the system to keep up with 1 second block times. What this looks like in practice is \"batched L1 origin updates\". This could be similar to span batches but for L1 origin updates.\r\n\r\nSome discussion:\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/discussions/241#discussioncomment-10052249\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/discussions/158#discussioncomment-9240485\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/82\r\n\r\nNice to have:\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/330\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/415", "OPEN", 0, "tynes", "2024-10-03T20:30:42Z", "2024-10-03T20:30:42Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/specs", "2025-08-30 21:58:30"]

This idea has been explored with logs in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/330 but has not yet been fully explored for batches.

This enables the authentication of a standard L2 chain by simply referencing the root hash. Each release of the L2 contracts would correspond to a hardfork. The network specific configuration would be pushed via deposit transactions to the L2 as the first transactions that the system processes via deposit transactions that are sent via `SystemConfig.initialize`. All of the getters for this configuration would be fetched from the `L1Block` contract. This follows the same design pattern for the L1 contracts where all immutables were removed in favor of storage so that the same contract implementations could be used by multiple chains.\n\nThere is an open question on how to handle the L2 `ProxyAdmin` owner. Right now, a standard stage 1 OP Stack chain should set the L2 `ProxyAdmin` owner to be the aliased account of the L1 security council/foundation multisig.\n\nThe following options explore the design spaces.\n\n## SystemConfig can set owner\n\nThis would follow the same pattern for all other network specific config, the `SystemConfig` would be able to deposit and set the owner in the `L1Block` contract. This would essentially mix roles in some cases unless we had more expressive RBAC in the `SystemConfig` as it would mix the security council and the chain operator in both having the ability to change the owner, since you can change the owner by calling `transferOwner` on the `ProxyAdmin` or have the owner of the `SystemConfig` initiate a deposit transaction that modifies the ownership. The way to solve this is only allow setting this value by the `SystemConfig` if the initial owner is `address(0)`, and then only the existing owner would be able to modify the value in the `L1Block` contract.\n\n## Depositor Account is owner\n\nEnshrine a new call path that emits a `TransactionDeposited` event in the `OptimismPortal` from the `DEPOSITOR_ACCOUNT` that calls the `ProxyAdmin`. The caller of this function could be fetched from the `SuperchainConfig`, allowing a single source of truth to be defined for which account can create an L2 `ProxyAdmin` action. This is a nice design because it enables both the protocol and the security council to take action on behalf of the L2 `ProxyAdmin`. Longer term we may want to remove this function as the OP Stack matures and only let the protocol act on behalf of the `ProxyAdmin`", "OPEN", 0, "tynes", "2024-09-24T04:18:27Z", "2024-10-01T18:07:38Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/specs", "2025-08-30 21:58:30"]

["I_kwDODjvEJM6UXtTV", 11609, "op-batcher: Assess da-type choice when submitting a channel", "## Context\r\n\r\nSince https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/11219 the batcher can dynamically switch between calldata and blobs, depending on the economically best option _at the time of starting a new channel_. This works reasonably well for high-throughput chains, where the delay between starting and submitting a channel is usually only a few minutes. But it is still not optimal, as the most economical option might have changed since building up the channel. Furthermore, for low-throughput chains, this behavior is useless, as a da-type decision delay of multiple hours is ineffective. And lastly, the decision is currently made under the assumption that the channel will be full to its size limit. But the channel may not be full, e.g. using less frames (=blobs) with a half-empty last frame because of a short max-channel-duration setting that closed it (especially relevant on testnets).\r\n\r\n## Change Description\r\n\r\nTo address these shortcomings, the batcher should perform a second/the check at the time that it would start submitting a channel (i.e., when starting to post the first batcher transaction for that channel (almost always a channel fits into a single batcher transaction, unless the first block added to it doesn't fit into the `target-num-frames` frames)), and possibly rebuild the channel using different da-type settings.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this improvement is to always select the best da-type for a channel at the time of tx submission, and make the dynamic da-type selection feature useable for low-throughput chains.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Hints\r\n\r\nIt probably makes most sense to _move_ the channel config retrieval via the `ChannelConfigProvider` from the point at which a new channel is created (https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/a36291dc345382094ba971ffd4cd5987e84b989f/op-batcher/batcher/channel_manager.go#L206) to the point at which the first frame of any channel is submitted (places where we return non-empty `txData` inside [`channelManager.TxData()`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/a36291dc345382094ba971ffd4cd5987e84b989f/op-batcher/batcher/channel_manager.go#L152C10-L152C32)), and then reuse that config for the following channel. This has two advantages. \r\n1. This adds the check for the correct channel config at the point when submission happens. Most of the time this check will confirm the current configuration.\r\n2. The channel config of the previous channel is the best estimator for the correct channel config of the following channel, when the exact data content isn't known yet.\r\n\r\nNote that a special case is a fresh batcher restart, at which point an estimated configuration has to be retrieved once before the first channel. But this could happen in the batcher's initialization path.\r\n\r\n### Channel Rebuilding\r\n\r\nIf the check doesn't confirm the channel config that's currently in use, the channel should be rebuilt using the new config. One good option to accomplish this may be to reinsert the blocks into the L2 blocks queue inside the `channelManager`, so that the existing code path is then used to build the channel with the new channel config. This has the advantage that e.g. if switching from calldata to blobs, the channel would suddenly have more space, so it wouldn't be immediately submitted and just continue to fill up regularly.\r\n\r\n### `ChannelConfigProvider`\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that the current [`ChannelConfigProvider`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-batcher/batcher/channel_config_provider.go) has a single method to retrieve the next estimated channel config, and the implementation of the dynamic provider always assumes full channels. This is not optimal for the proposed change, as we will know the exact channel data at the point of submission, so we can make an exact fee calculation. To enable this, I suggest we add a second method to the `ChannelConfigProvider` to make its interface look similar to the following:\r\n```go\r\ntype ChannelConfigProvider interface {\r\n\tChannelConfigFull() ChannelConfig // note: renamed old method that estimates full channels, would be used only at startup\r\n\tChannelConfig(data []byte) ChannelConfig // new method, takes exact data\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe new method can take as a parameter the exact data and use `core.IntrinsicGas` to exactly calculate the calldata gas in the dynamic provider, instead of this manual calculation:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/a36291dc345382094ba971ffd4cd5987e84b989f/op-batcher/batcher/channel_config_provider.go#L66-L68\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the existing cost comparison code at `DynamicEthChannelConfig.ChannelConfig()` should be as much reused between the two new methods as possible.\r\n\r\n### Channel Config Immutability\r\n\r\nOne important rule that should be observed is to not change the DA-type and channel configuration once the first frame of a channel started being submitted. This is important a) because otherwise we might end up trying to replace a transaction with a different tx type, which is not allowed and would get the batcher into a blocked tx recovery mode and b) in view of the upcoming Holocene features regarding [Strict Batch Ordering](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/11318) would invalidate future batcher transactions that might already be in the tx-pool because of parallel transaction sending.\r\n\r\nHardening the batcher's behavior during restarts should be done as a separate task, possibly introducing some form of persistence of in-flight transactions.", "CLOSED", 0, "sebastianst", "2024-08-27T12:39:28Z", "2024-10-02T17:41:08Z", "2024-09-25T13:40:45Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-30 22:00:33"]

However, this means that the actual interval between proposals will be longer in general, because the time that has passed since the last proposal before the restart occurred is added to the total interval.\r\n\r\nWe can check the DGF at startup for the submission time of the latest proposal at startup to shorten the initial interval accordingly.

Those contracts are currently in `op-challenger` which we probably don't want a direct dependency from `op-program` on, though it wouldn't be a problem necessarily, just a bit ick.  The contracts are already shared by `op-challenger` and `op-dispute-mon` so pulling them out to a shared module would be quite reasonable. I just haven't done it yet because I'm not sure where it should live or what it should be called - I don't think it should be in `op-service` because its far too fault proof specific.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the above is that we can query `GetGamesAtOrAfter` at startup for the configured interval and take the latest game into account to calculate the duration until submitting the next proposal.

With various hardforks, the fee calculations are changed. This adds tech debt to the state transition function as there becomes more branching logic depending on the currently active chain spec. For example, ecotone introduces a new fee formula and fjord may introduce a new fee formula. This means that every op stack execution client needs to support this branching logic.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to use EVM bytecode instead to define the L1 portion of the fee. A solidity interface could be defined that accepts the RLP encoded transaction and potentially some other data and it is expected to return a `uint256` that represents the L1 fee or the L1 gas used. This would remove altering the fee logic from being a hardfork and increase the social scalability of fee logic discussions as any team working on the OP Stack can choose to use their own fee formulas that work best for them. There should be some standard EVM bytecode that comes with the OP Stack that can do a good job of this fee charging so that teams don't need to think about this problem unless they really want to.\r\n\r\nThere are some performance considerations of this approach. Benchmarking is required to learn how much of an impact this would have on syncing. Spinning up an EVM instance to do this calculation will always be slower than running the calculation in native code. It is likely that it should be a `STATICCALL` context, ie no writing of state because that could result in some strange side effects. The only application of writing state would be to write the L1 fee to transient storage such that smart contracts would be able to access the value only during the execution of the particular transaction, this could be useful for meta tx relaying.\r\n\r\nAnother concern is how the L1 portion of the fee isn't committed to by the user's signature. There may have been some work done to attempt to standardize a \"multidimensional fee transaction for L2s\" that could help with this problem. If the smart contract can be swapped very quickly, then it may be possible for the network to overcharge end users for their L1 fee because they cannot express a \"max amount of L1 fee\" they are willing to pay. It is possible that this logic could exist in the smart contract doing the L1 fee charging itself, this could work well with smart contract wallets. This is already an issue for what its worth, as the chain operator can bump the L1 fee params in the `SystemConfig` arbitrarily.

These often improve processes or efficiency but can be postponed if necessary without immediate severe repercussions.\r\n- `p-high`: (Should do) Important tasks that contribute significantly to long-term goals but may not have an immediate deadline. Delaying these tasks could have considerable negative effects but are not as immediate as critical tasks.\r\n- `p-critical`: Tasks that have immediate deadlines or significant consequences if not completed on time.

When a chain is defined as a dependency, it means that the dependent chain's outputs are required as inputs to the chain. All L2 OP Stack chains consider L1 as a dependency, this means that all L1 receipts and transactions are used as inputs to creating the L2 chain.\r\n\r\nThe special property of L1 as a dependency is that it has the ability to originate **force include** transactions, also known as deposit transactions. To have deterministic deposit transactions, there is a synchrony assumption with the L2's progression being dependent on the liveness and ability to connect to the L1. From time to time, the L2's connection to a L1 node is lost.\r\n\r\nIn the world of OP Stack interop, it is possible to define a dependency on another L2 chain. Between L2s, there is no concept of force include transactions. If there was, it would create massive synchrony issues - if a single remote chain falls out of being in sync at the tip, it could cause a cascading reorg or chain halt across all of the interoperable chains as the chain notices that it doesn't have all of the inputs required to progress correctly.\r\n\r\nIt is not scalable to require the outputs of another chain as inputs to a chain. In the longer term, we need some sort of succinct proof to reduce the need to fully execute dependent chains. One way to do this is to update the interop scheme so that it allows inbound messages from chains in the dependency set OR chains that have been zk proven. This can happen 100% at the application layer.\r\n\r\nThe solution involves 2 types of proofs that together are able to enable a backwards compatible API so that from the point of view of a developer, the exact same tooling for sending cross chain messages will just work.\r\n- Remote safe output extension proof\r\n- Log inclusion proof\r\n\r\nThe remote safe output extension proof exists to extend the \"finalized\" view of a remote chain. This can be thought about like how a light client syncs the headers of a chain. The proof program would need to handle committing to all of the execution of a chain between two points.\r\n\r\nThe log inclusion proof exists to bind an identifier + log hash as correctly paired and part of the canonical chain. This could in theory be a merkle proof, but we do not have access to every historical block header on chain. The proof program would need to walk back from a finalized anchor point and show that the log does exist in the chain at the given identifier.\r\n\r\nThis scheme is meant to remove the need to fully sync all chains that are interoperable. As long as one person is creating a zk proof for a chain, then that zk proof can be used to process inbound messages from that chain. This scheme still depends on governance, as you do not want to interop with chains that are not stage 1/2 or have backdoors in their system.\r\n\r\nWe may want to consider the possibility of requiring multiproof for this scheme and having a \"maturation period\" before the proofs can be considered finalized. During this maturation period, it could be possible to overturn the results of a proof. In a stage 2 like system, if there is a disagreement between the multiproof then it would result in the interop protocol being paused and only restartable by a security council.\r\n\r\nThe following pseudocode shows how this can be possible to implement. This does not include all possible details and is meant more as an exercise to show what could be possible.

This is done using a single invariant, every `ExecutingMessage` event tuple from a specific predeploy must contain an `Identifier` that correctly references its log. This reference is made up of a chain id, block number and log index - all of the information required to point to a specific log on a specific chain.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// no need to emit the entire log, just need its hash\r\nevent ExecutingMessage(bytes32 indexed logHash, Identifier identifier);\r\n\r\nstruct Identifier {\r\n    address origin;\r\n    uint256 blocknumber;\r\n    uint256 logIndex;\r\n    uint256 timestamp;\r\n    uint256 chainid;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice the `ExecutingMessage` event contains the log hash - this means the log itself is observable from within the EVM. This can be thought of as being similar to multicast UDP for logs.\r\n\r\nIf a block is included that contains an `ExecutingMessage` where its tuple doesn't match, the block is reorg'd out as part of the L2 fork choice rule. This gives users the integrity to trust all cross chain messages at the application layer.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to do interop using storage slots rather than just logs. The `Identifier` would just look a little bit different.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nevent ExecutingMessage(bytes32 indexed storageValue, Identifier identifier);\r\n\r\nstruct Identifier {\r\n    address origin;\r\n    uint256 blocknumber;\r\n    bytes32 storageKey;\r\n    uint256 timestamp;\r\n    uint256 chainid;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis design was discarded due to the archival state requirement for verifying that a storage slot key value pair match on a particular chain at a given block number. If we add a history accumulator to the L2 block header, then we can solve the problem of infrastructure cost by running a single instance of a data pipeline that indexes a set of composable witnesses that are able to prove any storage slot at any height and use this to feed into the fork choice rule and proof system.", "OPEN", 0, "tynes", "2024-10-09T04:00:32Z", "2025-01-08T23:18:34Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/specs", "2025-08-31 00:13:29"]

It appears that when the `fromda` database is empty, callers (I think `op-geth`) ask for updates to Cross-Safety. This in turn makes its way all the way to `scopedCrossSafeUpdate`.\n\nThe supervisor should be able to detect and deny requests to the database which are obviously beyond the sync'd scope. This particular codepath is triggering because it's being identified as the \"first\" block in the database. It is obviously incorrect, but we should stop the call from even getting this far if the database is empty.\n\n# Reproduction Steps\n- Launch `local-devnet` (guides are lacking @axelKingsley can make one)\n- Allow the network to progress for a few moments\n- `sh` into the Supervisor container and run `rm -rf /db/* && killall op-supervisor` to destroy the database and immediately stop the supervisor.\n- Relaunch the supervisor, and observe the logs\n- After a few moments of runtime, the `panic` should occur.\n", "CLOSED", 0, "axelKingsley", "2024-11-12T20:13:22Z", "2025-01-10T07:38:07Z", "2025-01-10T07:38:05Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 00:14:16"]

The project is done when\r\n- All invalid payloads are derived as deposit-only blocks, starting with Holocene activation.\r\n- All out of oder frames and batches are discarded.\r\n- Holocene is activated on mainnet.\r\n- Possible downstream effects of this change have been derisked with Proofs and Interop teams.\r\n\r\n# Tasks\r\n\r\nSee individual task descriptions for details.\r\n- [x] #11313\r\n\r\n**Implementation**\r\n- [x] #11314\r\n- [x] #11316\r\n- [x] #11317\r\n- [x] #11330\r\n- [x] #11318\r\n- [x] #12157\r\n- [x] #12449\r\n- [x] #12120\r\n\r\n**Auxiliary**\r\n- [x] #11321\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nSee \r\n\r\n# See Also\r\n\r\n- [Holocene Derivation specs](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/holocene/derivation.html)\r\n- [design doc on steady batch derivation](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/20) by @tynes\r\n- [Internal PID](https://www.notion.so/oplabs/Steady-Batch-Derivation-Holocene-a5b3b6815a734519a583ea918c36240a)\r\n\r\n_-@sebastianst_", "CLOSED", 0, "BlocksOnAChain", "2024-07-16T15:12:30Z", "2025-01-13T16:22:22Z", "2025-01-13T16:22:22Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 00:16:34"]

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe current ops-bedrock devnet is defined in one docker-compose.yml file. This makes spinning up multiple L2s on devnet difficult. We need to have arbitrary number of L2s defined in devnet to test interoperability of opstack chains. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nSplit the docker compose yaml file into `base.yml` defining containers for L1 layer, and `overlays-l2.yml` defining containers for L2 layer. Then we can do `docker compose -f base.yml -f overlays-l2-A.yml -f overlays-l2-B ...` The role and responsibility of the [devnet launch script](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/bedrock-devnet/devnet/__init__.py) is to manage the meta data files into separate directories so that user can deploy arbitrarily number of L2s to the same devnet. \r\n\r\nIn order to deduplicate the container definitions in `overlays-l2-x.yml`, we use [extends](https://docs.docker.com/compose/multiple-compose-files/extends/) directive to inherit common configuration for any L2 layer, overriding chain specific metadata and configuration files for each L2 deployments\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n**Defining additional L2 chains statically in docker compose file**: It loses extensibility to multiple L2 chains if we are going to test interop message across arbitrary number of chains.

Another thread calling `FUTEX_WAKE` is all it takes;\nCalling FUTEX_WAKE needs to wake as many threads as supplied in val, not just one.\nThat said, any sane application will be protected from spurious wakes, thus countering issue 1., and they will only rely on the futex state to decide whether to wake up or go back to sleep, countering issue 2. Issue 3. is countered by the fact that every thread is scheduled eventually, regardless if it is asleep or not, so threads not awaken by FUTEX_WAKE will be awaken by the scheduler, provided the futex value allows it.\n\nSo, the current behavior is sound if the application is not doing anything \"creative\", and just using futex as intended (i.e. using it as a semaphore/mutex).\n\nThat is a fair assumption that can be expected from normal applications.\n\nThe problem is: there is a much simpler implementation, with better performance, that only requires the application to be protected from spurious wakes (pretty much a requirement for using futex(), documented in the man page).\n\n**Recommendation**\nIgnore futexes almost entirely, remove state entries related to them, and treat FUTEX_WAIT as if (*uaddr == val) { sched_yield(); } (mind finding #7, as it still applies in this case), or even simpler, as a plain sched_yield(), as the only possibility of *uaddr != val is if the thread was preempted between the userspace variable check and the futex() call, which is a very rare occurrence, and there is no harm in yielding anyway.\n\nGiven the static nature of the scheduler, it may be a good idea that FUTEX_WAKE is treated as sched_yield(), too, so to prevent starvation in case there is a thread spending most of its time holding a lock of interest to some other thread (not the case in most well written programs).\n\nIn this proposal, every thread is waked every time. This makes sense in MTCannon because every thread is rotated every time through the scheduler, so there is very little gain in number of state steps in skipping those threads. This is unlike Linux, where the vast majority of tasks are asleep and not even considered for scheduling.\n\nOf course, this is the simplest extreme. A middle ground would be to remove the state.wakeup and the wakeup procedure, as it adds nothing.\n\n[packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS64.sol](https://cantina.xyz/code/4ea41142-4359-4f62-bfaa-a542172cab5d/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS64.sol#L220-L238)\n            // Search for the first thread blocked by the wakeup call, if wakeup is set\n            // Don't allow regular execution until we resolved if we have woken up any thread.\n            if (state.wakeup != sys.FUTEX_EMPTY_ADDR) {\n                if (state.wakeup == thread.futexAddr) {\n                    // completed wake traversal\n                    // resume execution on woken up thread\n                    state.wakeup = sys.FUTEX_EMPTY_ADDR;\n                    return outputState();\n                } else {\n                    bool traversingRight = state.traverseRight;\n                    bool changedDirections = preemptThread(state, thread);\n                    if (traversingRight && changedDirections) {\n                        // then we've completed wake traversal\n                        // resume thread execution\n                        state.wakeup = sys.FUTEX_EMPTY_ADDR;\n                    }\n                    return outputState();\n                }\n            }\n[packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS64.sol](https://cantina.xyz/code/4ea41142-4359-4f62-bfaa-a542172cab5d/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/MIPS64.sol#L245-L268)\n            // check if thread is blocked on a futex\n            if (thread.futexAddr != sys.FUTEX_EMPTY_ADDR) {\n                // if set, then check futex\n                // check timeout first\n                if (state.step > thread.futexTimeoutStep) {\n                    // timeout!

Please describe.**\n I'm operating multiple Base and Optimism archive nodes. During this process, I am encountering persistent issues where block synchronization slows down significantly.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI would like to improve the synchronization speed of both the Base Mainnet and Optimism Mainnet archive nodes.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nWhile observing the logs of the op-node during periods of slow synchronization, I noticed the following warning message appearing multiple times:\n\n```\nlvl=warn msg=\"Engine temporary error\" err=\"temporarily cannot insert new safe block: failed to create new block via forkchoice: context deadline exceeded\"\n```\n\nThis error occurs when the `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV3` RPC call exceeds the configured timeout (5 seconds) and results in a request timeout. This behavior is intentional and expected, but when the request times out, the op-node retries the same RPC request, which introduces additional delay.\n\nTo address this, I experimented by increasing the timeout from 5 seconds to 30 seconds while synchronizing the Base Mainnet archive node. This change proved effective. The experiment involved three Base Mainnet archive nodes:\n\nBlue Node: The node that was synchronizing well (no special settings were applied to it other than displaying the latest block number).\nYellow Node: The node with synchronization issues (timeout increased from 5 seconds to 30 seconds).\nGreen Node: The node using the official image without any modifications.\nAfter one week of monitoring synchronization, as shown in the attached graph:\n\n<img width=\"824\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93620912-2206-4514-8e5e-5781343715a4\" />\n\nThe Yellow Node completed synchronization up to the latest block.\nThe Green Node still had not synchronized because its synchronization speed matched the block generation rate.\nFurther investigation through trace logs revealed that for blocks containing transactions with hundreds of logs, the `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV3` RPC call could take more than 10 seconds. (`DEBUG[01-19|05:13:53.027] Served engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV3        reqid=4941 duration=20.337986076s`)\n\nBased on these findings, I suggest the following improvements:\nAdd a flag to make the timeout adjustable, allowing users to set it according to their needs.\nFor full node operators, this change may not have a significant impact since they are already synchronizing well. \nHowever, for archive node operators experiencing slow synchronization, this flexible timeout could be beneficial. \nImportantly, this change should not negatively impact any operators.\n\n**Additional context**\nThe versions used for testing were op-node v1.10.2 and op-geth v1.101411.4, with all other specs and flags remaining the same except for the timeout. The experiment was conducted on an in-house server.\n\nI am running nodes both on my own server and in an AWS EC2 environment, and both environments are experiencing similar synchronization speed degradation. However, one unusual observation is that once the node catches up to the latest block, synchronization degradation does not occur frequently. But when the node is restarted, the blocks start to fall behind again. The proposed changes were helpful in this scenario.\n\nAdditionally, I also attempted to run archive nodes with reth, but due to its behavior of syncing multiple blocks at once, I observed that the gap would grow by about 10 blocks, then close again, repeating this cycle. As a result, I'm currently using op-geth.\n\n\n", "CLOSED", 0, "pengin7384", "2025-01-20T02:24:45Z", "2025-09-14T07:25:28Z", "2025-09-14T07:25:28Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 01:47:12"]

["I_kwDODjvEJM6mqy2U", 13837, "interop: Reorg Support - Goals and Design", "Here are some thoughts about Reorg Handling in the Supervisor\n\n# Types (sources) of Reorgs:\n\n## Unsafe Reorg\nIn this situation, the Supervisor is syncing nodes and making forward progress. A Node in Managed Mode receives an updated unsafe block from the gossip network, and drops an the old unsafe block it was carrying.\n\nWhen this happens, a new unsafe block notification will travel to the Supervisor, and the Supervisor will find that it holds conflicting log data for the given block.\n\nThere are two ways to consider this disagreement:\n1. The Supervisor is always the source of truth, and so the Supervisor should reset the Node and expect it to return to the originally indexed data\n1. Unsafe data is arbitrary, and if a node replaces old unsafe data with new unsafe data, that new data is more likely to be correct\n\nMy vote is for #2, unsafe data cannot be considered Cannonical against any L1 because it is just delivered over the gossip network.\n\n## Local Safety can't be promoted to Cross Safety\nIn this situation, a block is derived from the L1 and is recorded into the Local Derivation DB. Because the block contains some cross dependency, the Cross Safety doesn't advance through the block. Then, new data arrives for the cross-dependencies which reveal that the block we recorded as Locally Safe is actually *invalid* because the interop claims it made are incorrect.\n\nWhen this happens, the supervisor is the first to realize it, and must correct the node. The node must replace the invalid block with the deposit-only block. Furthermore, the Supervisor must ensure it doesn't *reconsume* the same Locally Safe data, causing this issue to loop.\n\nThis work has been started here: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/13645\n\n## L1 change\nIn this situation, all derivation and syncing is happening correctly, and then the L1 itself reorgs. Now all the data used to derive blocks is called into question.\n\nWhen this happens, all Unsafe, Local and Cross data must be evaluated. Local and Cross Derivation Data will certainly need to be purged, as the L2 blocks now derive from different L1 blocks. And it is possible that the L1 reorg changed the L2 reality, invalidating unsafe data as well.\n\n## Desync\nThis covers any situation in which the Node and Supervisor are working correctly, and then through some outside means (restart, cosmic radiation, an operator error) the database becomes inconsistent.\n\nThese situations are varied, so the recovery path is varried as well, but generally we will need to determine what data is missing or incorrect, and will need to prune back databases to that point and resync.\n\n# Thinking about Reorgs Architecturally\nIt would really suck if we had to implement N different reorg handlers based on the N different situations above. Really, they all fall into the same basic behavior, where the inconsistency is identified, the bad data is destroyed, and the Node and Supervisor are resync'd to canonical data.\n\nWe can think of canonicity as being an activity in two parts:\n- Allow valid data\n- Don't allow invalid data\n\nWe achieve the former through consistency checks on-write to the ChainsDB which already exist -- when new data is added to event and derivation databases, it *must* build upon the previously recorded blocks.\n\nWe can achieve the *latter* using a centralized system. I'm imagining this utility as \"The Invalidator\"\n\nThe Invalidator would be a new component of the Supervisor whose entire purpose is to destroy incorrect data between the Node and Supervisor. All of the above cases can generate *event signals* which flow to the Invalidator and trigger similar workflows:\n- Identify the incorrect data\n- Destroy (prune) the incorrect data\n- Insert data where required (like to mark a Locally Invalidated block so we don't retry it)\n- Initiate resync\n\nLikely most of this code could be singleton, meaning we can keep the complexity very low and the reasoning high.", "CLOSED", 0, "axelKingsley", "2025-01-17T20:23:54Z", "2025-02-05T13:19:51Z", "2025-02-05T13:19:50Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 01:47:12"]

It's useful to be able to quickly understand what's being imported but there's no automatic enforcement on this style. We don't like having styles that aren't enforced automatically!\n\nUsing `forge fmt` with the `sort_imports` option doesn't really work here because that option sorts alphabetically and not by import *type* which is generally way more useful when understanding what's being used in the contract.\n\nA good tool here would live inside of `scripts/checks`. We need to be careful about how to implement this because the logic isn't immediately obvious for edge cases like a contract and an interface being imported from the same place. My recommendation for now is that if multiple things are imported from the same file then we use the type of the very first import to determine how to classify that import. It usually works well enough.\n\nImport groups are:\n\n- Contracts (whenever a `contract` is imported)\n- Libraries (whenever a `library` is imported)\n  - Errors count as libraries\n- Interfaces (whenever an `interface` is imported)\n- Scripts (whenever you import from the `scripts` folder)\n- Testing (whenever you import from the `testing` folder)\n\nScripts and Testing takes precedent over the rest.

["I_kwDODjvEJM6ZwZ4N", 12412, "EVM Engineering: automate interface generation", "# Context\r\nIn our ongoing efforts to enhance the OP Stack smart contract development process, we recently introduced interfaces to the OP Stack. This addition serves two primary purposes: it simplifies integration for external developers and significantly reduces compile time. As we've seen positive results from this change, interfaces are likely to remain a core part of our development strategy moving forward.\r\n\r\nTo ensure consistency and best practices, we've created a [comprehensive guide](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/INTERFACES.md) detailing our approach to using interfaces.\r\n\r\n# Problem Statement\r\n\r\nWhile the introduction of interfaces has brought substantial benefits, we've identified a key pain point in our current workflow. The process of adding and maintaining these interfaces manually has become a time-consuming and error-prone task for develoeprs. This manual overhead contradicts the goal of streamlining the development process.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we want to create an environment where our developers can focus on writing high-quality contract logic without getting bogged down in the intricacies of interface management. The current situation requires developers to constantly think about how to properly use and update interfaces, which diverts attention from core development tasks.\r\n\r\nWe've explored existing tools like `cast interface` and `forge inspect` as potential solutions. While these tools are useful, they fall short in generating fully correct interfaces due to some limitations in handling complex types:\r\n\r\n1. They often generate incorrect types for more complex constructs like enums.\r\n2. Instead of properly importing and reusing library types, they generate inline libraries, leading to code duplication and potential inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nThese limitations mean that even when using these tools, developers still need to manually review and correct the generated interfaces, which doesn't fully solve the efficiency problem.\r\n\r\n# Goals\r\nTo address these challenges, we propose the development of a custom, automated interface generation tool. Our goals for this tool are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Automatic Generation**: Develop a tool that can automatically generate accurate and complete interfaces for our smart contracts.\r\n\r\n2. **Seamless Integration**: The tool should function similarly to our existing snapshot generation process, integrating smoothly into our current development workflow.\r\n\r\n3. **Intelligent Type Handling**: Implement a coherent and consistent strategy for managing types within the generated interfaces. This strategy should address two key questions:\r\n   - Under what circumstances should types be redefined within the interface?\r\n   - When is it more appropriate to import types from existing libraries?\r\n\r\nBy achieving these goals, we aim to significantly reduce the manual effort required in interface management, minimize the potential for errors, and allow our developers to focus more on core contract logic and less on interface maintenance.\r\n\r\n# Tasks\r\n\r\n- [x] #12413 \r\n- [x] #12414 \r\n- [x] #12415 ", "OPEN", 0, "smartcontracts", "2024-10-10T18:55:48Z", "2025-02-04T19:32:23Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 01:47:12"]

The `DeputyGuardianModule`, also known as _DGM_, is a smart contract deployed on L1 (currently [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc6901f65369fc59fc1b4d6d6be7a2318ff38db5b)) that has, for example, the ability to widely pause the Superchain. The `DGM` is owned by the _Foundation Operation Safe_ so only operation run from the _Foundation Operation Safe_ can be executed into the `DGM`. To make sure we can widely pause the Superchain rapidly enough in case of an emergency, we need to presign the pause transaction from the signers of the _FoS_. These transactions are also known as `PSP` for PreSigned Pause transactions. This process requires a ceremony and this is slow and tedious to put in place.\r\n\r\n# Problem Statement\r\n\r\nThe existing `DeputyGuardianModule` is not _proxified_. This is inconvenient each time we want to upgrade the `DeputyGuardianModule` to add a new feature or to fix a potential bug. As this is not a proxy this require to redeploy the `DeputyGuardianModule` on L1. And also, to update the `Guardian` contract to add the new `DeputyGuardianModule` address as authorized module. Moreover, changing the `DeputyGuardianModule` will break the current PSPs setup as these pause transactions are presigned with the **previous** `DeputyGuardianModule`. Thus, we need to generate new PSPs through the tedious process of a ceremony to add the new `DeputyGuardianModule` for making the PSPs valid again. We are clearly seeing that this is not a sustainable solution for the long term. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have to simulate the new PSPs and share them with other member of the Superchain.\r\n\r\n# Project Updates\r\n\r\n- [2024-09-27] Draft design document is available [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/89).\r\n- [2024-09-27] Draft design document is being actively reviewed.\r\n- [2024-10-28] Design document has been approved and merged.\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n- [Design document](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/89)", "CLOSED", 0, "smartcontracts", "2024-09-27T15:29:14Z", "2025-02-04T19:30:45Z", "2025-02-04T19:30:45Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 01:47:12"]

~[ ] We remove the `withdrawals` list from the encoding, diverging from the L1 beacon-chain `ExecutionPayload` encoding.~\n- [x] Spec that we continue to use `engine_newPayloadV3` engine-API,\n  but now with the additional `ExecutionPayload` attribute, that is omitted pre-Isthumus.\n- [x] Specs update to describe new CL P2P gossip topic, with updated `ExecutionPayload` SSZ encoding,\n  and a gossip-validation rule that checks if the withdrawals root is non-nil, and withdrawals list is empty.\n  This spec change goes into the main `rollup-node-p2p.md`, to be consistent with the other gossip topics.\n- [x] Update fault-proof-program spec that describes the output-claim verification,\n  and link to the Isthumus specs change of the block header.\n\nCreated https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/394 to track work for spec updates\n\n## CL / op-node TODOs\n\n- [x] Update the `ExecutionPayload` type to have the optional withdrawals root\n- [x] Update the SSZ encoding implementation of the payload.\n  To conditionally either encode the empty-list (pre-Isthumus) (simply just an offset constant) or an empty list *and* a 32 fixed-size value.\n- [x] `op-node/p2p` update to activate new gossip topic for `Isthumus`.\n- [x] Update `op-node/rollup/attributes/engine_consolidate.go`:\n  - pre-Shanghai: attributes must have nil withdrawals list and nil withdrawals-root.\n  - pre-Isthumus: attributes must have empty withdrawals list (different than nil!), execution-payload must have empty withdrawals list and nil withdrawals-root.\n  - post-Isthumus: attributes must have empty withdrawals list, execution-payload must have empty withdrawals list and non-nil withdrawals-root.\n- [x] Action-test to cover L2 block before, at, and after Isthumus.\n  All 3 cases with and without withdrawal-storage change (by inserting a withdrawal tx in L2).\n- [x] Add a note to `op-node/api.go` `node.OutputAtBlock` that the `OutputV0AtBlock` function handles the Isthumus change.\n- [x] Change `op-service/sources/l2_client.go` `L2Client.OutputV0AtBlock` to\n  check if Isthumus is active based on the timestamp of the retrieved block-header.\n  If it is, then don't fetch the storage or storage-proof,\n  but use the Withdrawals-hash from the block-header to construct the output-root.\n- [x] Ensure that the `op-service/sources/eth_client.go` functionality of block/header verification does not break. In particular, update the withdrawals-list verification of the block-body, to enforce an empty non-nil list. And the header must have a non-nil withdrawals-root after genesis.\n- [x] Update op-program output-root construction to not retrieve the withdrawals-root from storage, but from the block-header.\n  While technically compatible without this change, there are other op-program changes,\n  and we want to prevent the arbitrary storage-lookup preimage needs that come with the state-access.\n\n### op-geth TODOs\n\n- [x] Review the [op-geth draft PR](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/383), to be reused as feature-branch tracker.\n- [x] Json roundtrip of block and header types\n- [x] RLP roundtrip of block and header types\n- [x] `ExecutableData` json encode/decode test\n- [x] Geth note (clarify, and include in `fork.yaml`): t8ntool was not updated,\n  it doesn't support some OP-Stack features already, so it is not worth it to handle the withdrawals root case.\n  It is also just unfortunate code-duplication in this tool that it does not use the same sealer as Geth consensus does.\n- [x] ~Describe the feature-branch changes in `fork.yaml`.~ -- no feature branch will be used per discussion below\n- [ ] Make sure the op-geth commits are tidy, description format should match upstream commits.\n", "CLOSED", 0, "protolambda", "2024-09-21T22:28:31Z", "2025-02-04T01:39:32Z", "2025-02-04T01:39:31Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 01:47:12"]

["I_kwDODjvEJM6PmW4T", 11152, "op-node: event-system customizability and plugins (ideas)", "The op-node core consists of an event-broadcast system:\r\n- Derivers: process events\r\n- Emitters: output events\r\n\r\nThrough these events, the op-node sub-systems communicate tasks like block-processing, block-derivation from the DA, sequencing, etc.\r\n\r\nThe deriver/emitter is registered through `event.System`,  which can execute these components either synchronously (current default), or in parallel (work in progress).\r\n\r\nThe components are \"registered\" with the system by name. This makes it possible to attribute metrics to each sub-system, and unregister as necessary.\r\n\r\n### Plugins\r\n\r\nThis may be the beginning of a plugin-system; performing and triggering additional tasks by monitoring and emitting events is trivial.\r\n\r\nThe question is just how we load additional event derivers/emitters.\r\n\r\nOne option may be with Go plugins, to allow runtime customization. A Go plugin can be a DLL type file, auto-discovered in a directory by the op-node, and declare some global function as access-point to register new event-derivers/emitters from. Go plugins could be developed outside of the monorepo, import the monorepo as library, and utilize all the event/plugin types as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe drawback of Go plugins are the challenges with distribution; plugins are not packaged up with docker-images, or automatically platform-compatible. Still, runtime customization does open up a lot of extensibility, while keeping the core stack unified in the main repository. This may outweigh the distribution challenges. Besides, if the op-node docker image has a standard mounting point for a plugin-directory, and if a plugin is distributed as a bundle with each platform target, then it's relatively simple to work with.\r\n\r\nBased on demand we may start a design doc in the [design-docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs) repository to further expand on the idea.\r\n\r\n### Event deriver/emitter composition\r\n\r\nNot all plugins are additive however, some may want to *replace* certain subsets of functionality.\r\nUnregistering/registering complete sub-systems might be too much, if only small things have to change.\r\n \r\nTo do so, we may want to change the event-deriver interface.\r\n\r\nFrom:\r\n```go\r\nfunc (m *myDeriver) OnEvent(ev event.Event) bool {\r\n   switch ev.(type) {\r\n    case FooEvent: ...\r\n    case BarEvent: ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTo something more like:\r\n```go\r\nfunc (m *myDeriver) Setup(sys event.System) bool {\r\n  event.Register[FooEvent](sys, \"foo-handling\", func(ev FooEvent) {\r\n    ...  // replaces existing \"foo-handling\"\r\n  })\r\n  event.Register[BarEvent](sys, \"bar-handling-my-extension\", func(ev BarEvent) {\r\n    ... // net-new event handler, to extend regular \"bar-handling\"\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis would enable a finer level of detail, while also being more explicit about exactly *which* events a deriver needs to listen to. This way we can drop the \"bool\" return parameter, and possibly reduce event-processing overhead (no broadcast to derivers that just ignore the event).\r\n\r\n### Permissions / metadata\r\n\r\nIf we are going with plugins, we may want the plugin to pre-declare which event types it will process and emit. And then enforce the input/output limitations to the plugin.\r\n\r\nThis way we can tell if a plugin is just listening to forkchoice-updates, or actually emitting engine-instructions.\r\n\r\nDifferent event types could be declared, and categorized by *how they affect the op-node*, such that we can have standard-compatible extensions, as well as *consensus-breaking* extensions (for custom OP-Stack chains), or e.g. *plasma specific* extensions. This is similar to how apps in app-stores request system permission, and the user can trust that the app does not break their expectations. Or in OP-Stack context, that the plugin is compatible with a certain blockspace charter.\r\n\r\n", "OPEN", 0, "protolambda", "2024-07-15T16:54:13Z", "2025-10-01T14:34:28Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 01:47:12"]

If the Node is incompatible with the Supervisor due to an *Unsafe (L2) Reorg*, walking back the Node is not enough. This is because, even though the Node is now ready to reprocess this block range, the Log Events which were already indexed to the Supervisor come from the chain which is now reorg'd out.\n\nBecause the Node already supplied logs, and because those logs are wrong, the next action that the newly reset Node might take could be seen as inconsistent against the (incorrect) Event Database in the Supervisor. This would trigger another reset cycle.\n\nThe correct behavior we would want is:\n- When rewinding the OP-Node, also prune the Events Database (and probably the derivation databases?)\n- When rewinding is complete, re-index the log data, and redo all downstream calculations (cross-unsafe, etc)\n\n\n(Original Ticket Body Below)\n```\nWhen op-supervisor starts up, it needs to check if a reorg has happened on any of its chains that invalidates the logs it has already written.\n\nNeed to think it through carefully, but most likely should find the latest search checkpoint that is still canonical in the log db and rollback to that.

The community seems to recognize the importance of having multiple client implementations for the health of the overall Optimism ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that the Cannon fraud proofs are being built with a strong dependency on Geth specific APIs.  In particular, the `fraudproof_test.go` e2e tests seem to ultimately be using the `debug_dbGet` API.  Based on my reading of these tests, this API is not simply being used by the test, but is actually relied on by the implementation.  This feels like a serious problem because this API is not part of the formal Ethereum JSON RPC spec, so its behavior is not defined.  Additionally because there is no real versioning guarantees over the layout of the Geth database, it is also inherently not stable.\r\n\r\nI've not had a chance to really dig into exactly how this API is being used in Cannon, but based on other usage seen in the e2e tests, I suspect that its usage might be related to retrieving nodes of the Merkle Trie.  Could we instead use the `eth_getProof` API instead?  Do we need to put an EIP together for a new well specified API that other clients can implement?  Is the `debug_dbGet` usage simply intended to be transient and replaced with something else ultimately?

In this transition, chains within the dependency set may or may not have actually progressed, depending on their blocktime.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d99fc8b0-0fd5-4847-a380-c5dd8541ef21)\n\n### Example Case\n\nFor this example, let's consider there's two chains in the dependency set\n* Chain A (1s blocktime)\n* Chain B (2s blocktime)\n\nAt `t: 3`, for example, Chain A's block timestamp in the superchain snapshot would be `3`, but Chain B's would be `2`. This means that with the current timestamp invariant (`initiating message timestamp MUST be <= executing message timestamp`), an actor would not be allowed to relay an initiating message from Chain A block # 3 within Chain B's block # 1. However, in the very next superchain snapshot @ `t: 4`, the timestamps of the blocks within the snapshot will have equivocated, and round-trip messages will once again be allowed.\n\nThis can create a non-trivial challenge for relaying applications in a post-interop world, where landing intra-block message bundles across multiple chains becomes a more difficult task (requiring targeting specific superchain snapshots, and growing in complexity with the more varied block times in the dependency set.) In the eyes of a user, sometimes their bundles will fail, and sometimes they will succeed.\n\n### Suggestion\n\nTo allow for round-trip messaging within any superchain snapshot, we should find a way to lift the timestamp invariant into a non-local check. A possible route is changing the invariant to:\n\n> The timestamp at the time of inclusion of the initiating message MUST be less than or equal to the largest timestamp observed within the superchain snapshot as well as greater than or equal to the Interop Start Timestamp.\n\nBut this has some downsides, requiring more data to be fed into the verification function for individual message ends.

On my macbook these files are being stored under the `/Users/<username>/.foundry/anvil/tmp/` directory.\r\n\r\n## Recommended fix\r\nanvil provides a `--max-persisted-states` states flag to help with this (see this issue from foundry: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/8399). I recommend we set this to a low number for now and if there is a user demand for making this configurable we can add a cli flag that allows them to configure it.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\nThe `--max-persisted-states` flag controls how many blockchain state snapshots are persisted (saved) during the execution of the local Ethereum development chain. State snapshots refer to stored representations of the blockchain at a specific point in time. Anvil allows developers to \"snapshot\" the current state of the chain, which can later be restored (using the `evm_revert` JSON-RPC call). This feature is useful for testing because you can run a series of tests, revert the chain to a prior state, and then run another set of tests on the exact same blockchain state. \r\n\r\nThe `--max-persisted-states` flag sets a limit on how many of these snapshots (states) are saved or persisted on disk. This is useful for controlling disk usage and preventing your system from filling up with old or unnecessary snapshots. Without this flag, Anvil will keep all snapshots, potentially using a lot of disk space if you create a large number of them during testing. By using the `--max-persisted-states` flag, you can limit the number of snapshots to a certain number. For example, if you set it to 10, Anvil will only keep the last 10 snapshots, and older snapshots will be deleted as new ones are created.", "OPEN", 0, "tremarkley", "2024-10-02T00:13:52Z", "2025-02-14T23:29:02Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/supersim", "2025-08-31 01:48:44"]

If it was cross safe at the game\u2019s L1 head, use the super root, otherwise use invalid.\n    - Reasoning: If the super root isn\u2019t cross safe, then an earlier step deriving an optimistic block must have had insufficient data.

If it *was not* cross safe at the game\u2019s L1 head, the expected claim is the invalid state\n    - Reasoning: The prior timestamp boundary was not cross safe so by the reasoning above, we must have transitioned to the invalid state before then and are thus still at the invalid state.\n- Fetch the super root for the next timestamp transition (ie the timestamp we are transitioning *to*). If it *was* cross safe at the game\u2019s L1 head then all optimistic blocks must be able to be derived successfully. Do *not* use the invalid state for this claim.\n- If the previous timestamp *was* cross safe and the next timestamp *was not* cross safe, then one of the optimistic blocks in this timestamp transition cannot be derived and we must find which.

Some parameters do not work for subcommand `inspect` \r\n    1. `--workdir` is uselss when execute `op-deployer  inspect genesis/rollup/l1/deploy-config`\r\n    2. `--outfile` is uselss when execute `op-deployer  inspect genesis/rollup/l1/deploy-config`, I can only redirect the std out into a file.\r\n2. Meet some error for intent.toml config:\r\n    1. After execute `op-deployer init`, the `intent.toml` in workdir has two fields:\r\n         ```\r\n         [[chains]]\r\n           eip1559Denominator = 50\r\n           eip1559Elasticity = 6\r\n         ```\r\n         But when I delete them and execute `op-deployer apply xxxx`, it meets assert error:\r\n         ```\r\n         Application failed: error in pipeline stage apply: failed to combine L2 init config: combined deploy config failed validation: config field L2InitializationConfig failed checks: config field EIP1559DeployConfig failed checks: invalid deploy config: EIP1559Denominator cannot be 0\r\n         ```\r\n         I think those two fields should have default value, even I delete it, it should still work by using default value.\r\n        \r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\n1. for op-deployer version, I use this release : https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-deployer%2Fv0.0.3\r\n2. I follow the doc from https://docs.optimism.io/builders/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer\r\n    1. execute `op-deployer init --l1-chain-id 11155111 --l2-chain-ids <l2-chain-id> --workdir .deployer`\r\n    2. execute `op-deployer apply --workdir .deployer --l1-rpc-url <rpc-url> --private-key <private key hex>`\r\n    3. in doc, it shows we need to enter `.deployer` dir, so it's strange, if the parameter can provide `--workdir` then way do I need to enter this dir. So when I tested in the parent dir and provide `--workdir .deployer`, it does not work. Then if I enter the dir `.depoyer` dir, and without `--workdir .deployer` it can work. So I think `--workdir` is useless.\r\n    4. also for `--outfile`, it's useless, I can only use the command like:\r\n       ```\r\n       op-deployer  inspect rollup xxx --workdir workspace --outfile rollup.json > rollup.json\r\n       ```\r\n      to export the output into a file.\r\n\r\n**Environment Information:**\r\nop-deployer version:https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-deployer%2Fv0.0.3\r\nexecute for sepolia\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nBy the way, I hope when exeute `op-deployer apply`, the command line can provide the parameters to set the gas price.

There are some performance bottlenecks with the current implementation.  In particular, [cache invalidation](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/d520441b008833d8ee8ee69bbe2e8158366279d0/cannon/mipsevm/memory/memory.go#L202-L202) and [merkleization](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/d520441b008833d8ee8ee69bbe2e8158366279d0/cannon/mipsevm/memory/memory.go#L134-L141) are expensive. Cache invalidation touches a lot of memory and we have to walk down the tree invalidating cached nodes one by one.  Similarly, we do a lot of hashing when remerkleizing as data is updated. \r\n\r\nSome preliminary prototyping suggests we could get better performance by moving to a radix trie like the [modified Merkle-Patricia Trie (MPT)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/) used to store Ethereum state data.  Radix tries can more efficiently store sparse data, minimizing time spent looking up values and reducing merkleization costs.  A benefit of MPTs is that we already have a [Merkle-Patricia Trie solidity implementation](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L330-L335), which should simplify on-chain integration.  \r\n\r\nWe can start experimenting by implementing a new Memory format using a MPT.  To avoid committing to the new format, we can create a [Memory interface](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/d520441b008833d8ee8ee69bbe2e8158366279d0/cannon/mipsevm/iface.go#L11-L11) so that we can swap different memory implementations into the VM while testing.  We'll want to start by benchmarking off-chain performance before thinking about fully integrating any new approach.\r\n\r\nDuring preliminary prototyping with a MPT, we used leaf values of 4096 bytes ([1 page ](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/d520441b008833d8ee8ee69bbe2e8158366279d0/cannon/mipsevm/memory/page.go#L23)in the current implementation), with 20-bit keys. We may want to start with an off-the-shelf implementation to see what performance looks like.  We could consider implementing our own MPT if we can't find a sufficiently performant implementation.  We could also consider experimenting with the structure of the trie in other ways, like modifying the branching factor (standard MPTs are hexary - branches have 16 children), though it may be simpler to stick with a standard format.", "OPEN", 0, "mbaxter", "2024-08-30T19:09:30Z", "2025-02-13T19:41:52Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 01:49:16"]

Without this we risk our challenger being unable to counter games in a timely manner because the nodes are unable to keep up with the chain.\r\n\r\n op-program will need to be modified to be able to load L2 world state data and code via a more standard API.

Using a third party would allow the team to focus on core capabilities rather than infrastructure-heavy tasks.\n* If we invest in an OP Labs-based indexing solution, it seems we have consensus that we should focus on a narrow set of events or contracts rather than indexing everything.\n* We may be able to leverage existing infra like the Open Labels Initiative's EAS schema for contract labels, or integrating with existing contract registries.\n\n**Next Steps:** \n1. **Clarify the requirements** - what do our Q1 projects truly need in terms of indexed data? \n-- It seems **contract dashboard** may be the only area where we strictly need indexing, so perhaps we should use a third party solution there. \n2. **Evaluate third-party options** - Explore data providers like Goldsky or open initiatives like Open Labels Initiative to determine if they can cover our most pressing needs.

We could bump the minor/patch versions on other upgrades where the client software doesn't absolutely need to be updated. The L2 client software would have a max known major version and compare it against what is onchain and halt if the onchain version is greater than the known version.\n\nWe could delete/simplify parts of `ProtocolVersions` so that it exactly fits the usecase of universally guaranteeing safety over liveness.

From the point of view of the protocol, what is a blocktime exactly?\n\nThe only thing that the protocol sees is the incrementing value in the block header. An OP Stack chain with a 2 second blocktime doesn't mean that it must create a block every 2 seconds - it just means that every block that is produced must have its timestamp incremented by 2. In theory a sequencer could build blocks extremely fast, incrementing the timestamp by 2 seconds until it reaches the maximum its allowed to be ahead of the L1 timestamp.\n\nThe most simple way to think about supporting 1 second blocktimes is to simply make it so that the timestamp increments by 1 and change nothing else about how time is managed within the protocol. This could be introduced via a hardfork and chains that opt in could have their blocktime change to 1 second. There are some chains that support OP Stack based L3s, which would break if they moved to 1 second. There have not been any hardforks yet that chains have opted out of and introducing this sets a precedent. If we wanted to prevent the need for backwards compatibility concerns, then we can allow a chain operator to set their blocktime via the `SystemConfig`. This guarantees backwards compatibility and allows chains to modify their blocktime as they see fit, but is much more complex then simply hardforking in 1 second blocktime.\n\nAnother way to think about supporting 1 second blocktimes is to change the way that time is managed in the OP Stack. Right now every block timestamp is deterministic and known ahead of time. This is similar to L1 after proof of stake. During Ethereum proof of work, the timestamp could be chosen by the miner but it had constraints on what it could be. Allowing for this could enable a more flexible design space with blocktime where its not necessarily enshrined into the protocol. We could change the gas limit as defined in the `SystemConfig` to be the epoch level gas limit rather than the block gas limit. The sequencer could have the right to produce blocks with the same timestamp and choose the timestamp for its blocks but the timestamp must be within a range so that it doesn't fall too far ahead or behind. The block building software now has flexibility with choosing the blocktime now, it becomes a configuration parameter of the sequencer rather than a protocol level config. \n\nHaving an epoch level gas limit doesn't play well with when the sequencer loses its connection to L1. That would mean that the sequencer has a liveness failure more more quickly compared to the existing max sequencer drift rules. The epoch gas limit gets used up and the sequencer must observe the next L1 origin to be able to produce more gas. Perhaps a way around this would be to make the epoch level gas limit instead be a timestamp level gas limit and keep the existing timestamp drift rules. With a cap on the max number of blocks that can be produced with the same timestamp, it forces the same progression of timestamps, which can still move forward building on the same L1 origin until the sequencer drift kicks in.\n\nAllowing the sequencer to choose the timestamp means that it can bias RNG. Application developers should already be aware at this point that the timestamp isn't good for creating on chain RNG.", "OPEN", 0, "tynes", "2024-12-11T01:30:20Z", "2025-04-04T16:50:41Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/specs", "2025-08-31 03:24:22"]

This can be changed without breaking state-transition or client side, if L1 breaks things.\n  - For future tx types we need a fallback to prepare the preimage using a non-JSON source, that has the `opaque` form of the tx.\n  - EIP-7702 receipt support\n\n### `op-geth`\n\n- [x] Land the 1.14.12 PR: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/452\n- [ ] Implement and land the upcoming v1.14.13 changes:\n  - Contains EIP-7702: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30078\n  - Fixes the internal Geth requests-root Go API churn.

Please describe.**\n\nWhile implementing external block building for OP networks through tools like Rollup-boost, I've encountered a limitation - there is currently no way for block builders to fingerprint blocks to identify which blocks were built by external builders versus the standard sequencer. This is important for block builders to track performance, diagnose any issues, and verify whether their blocks are successfully being included in the chain.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nAdd functionality to OP chains that would allow external block builders to include some form of identification or signature in the blocks they produce. This would enable builders to verify when their blocks are included in the chain.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nThe only current alternative is to add a custom transaction at the end of the block, but this creates more issues with gas costs, transaction ordering, and implementation complexity.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nUnlike with L1 chains, the extra data field in OP blocks cannot be used for fingerprinting as it is already fully utilized. This leaves external block builders with no reliable mechanism to identify their contributions to the chain.\n\n(cc @danyalprout, @0xKitsune)", "OPEN", 0, "ferranbt", "2025-04-03T08:56:00Z", "2025-04-03T15:28:06Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 03:25:10"]

Withdrawals can be\r\nfinalized if the `FaultDisputeGame` instance resolves in favor of the defender, the instance is not blacklisted, and the game has sat around for the air-gap period.\r\n\r\nThe `DisputeGameFactory` can create different implementations of the `DisputeGame` which typically have different code and are identified by an integer \"game type\". The `OptimismPortal` currently defines a variable `respectedGameType` which determines the particular `DisputeGame` code that users can utilize when proving and finalizing withdrawals. The \"fallback\" safety net action is the ability for the Guardian or Deputy Guardian address to change the `respectedGameType` variable to some alternative game type (e.g., the `PermissionedDisputeGame`) in the case that the `FaultDisputeGame` contract is found to be buggy.\r\n\r\n# Problem Statement\r\n\r\nThe fallback action of changing the `respectedGameType` variable updates another variable called `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt` that keeps track of exactly when the respected game type was changed. Currently, the `OptimismPortal` contract enforces that withdrawals can only be proven or finalized against `DisputeGame` contracts that were created with a timestamp greater than the `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt` variable. This effectively invalidates any withdrawal proofs that were submitted prior to the activation of the fallback mechanism.\r\n\r\nWithdrawal invalidation is a powerful tool in the incident response playbook as it can mitigate the impact of a large number of invalid dispute games at the same time. However, it also forces users to resubmit their withdrawal proofs and wait an additional 7 days to execute a withdrawal. Users have reported that this invalidation and additional delay period is a pain point. This user impact means that the fallback is highly disruptive as a standard security mechanism.\r\n\r\n# Project Updates\r\n\r\n- [2024-09-27] Draft design document is available [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/77).\r\n- [2024-09-27] Draft design document is being actively reviewed.\r\n- [2024-10-28] Design document has been approved and merged.\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n- [Design document](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/77)", "CLOSED", 0, "smartcontracts", "2024-09-27T15:24:56Z", "2025-04-02T17:25:23Z", "2025-04-02T17:25:23Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 03:25:10"]

As of the Granite upgrade, each implementation of the `DisputeGame` uses its own `DelayedWETH` contract. Each `DelayedWETH` contract is `Ownable` and is subject to a number of safety net actions by the owner address (holding balances from specific addresses or removing all ETH held in the `DelayedWETH` contract). `DelayedWETH` is additionally subject to the Superchain-wide pause mechanism within the `SuperchainConfig`. Bonds cannot be retrieved by game participants if the Superchain pause is active.\r\n\r\n# Problem Statement\r\n\r\nExisting security mechanisms within the `DelayedWETH` contract are inconvenient and slow down the incident response process. Specifically:\r\n\r\n- The `DelayedWETH.hold(address target)` function creates an approval from the target address to the owner address. Since the target can simply remove this approval, hold MUST be triggered alongside a `transferFrom` in the same transaction. This adds unnecessary complexity to something that could simply be a single transaction.\r\n- The various security mechanisms inside of `DelayedWETH` can only be triggered by the System Owner which has a slow SLA. The Deputy Guardian can act to trigger the Superchain-wide pause, but this is highly disruptive to the entire Superchain ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it should be noted that all ETH inside a `DelayedWETH` contract is pooled together regardless of which games are using the contract. We currently mitigate this by using one `DelayedWETH` contract per game type, but this expands the number of contracts that the System Owner and Guardian roles must manage by at least 2 per additional chain. However, the modifications required to appropriately address this issue are sufficiently extensive that they are considered out of scope for this proposal.\r\n\r\n# Project Updates\r\n\r\n- [2024-09-27] Draft design document is available [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/80).\r\n- [2024-09-27] Draft design document is being actively reviewed.\r\n- [2024-10-28] Design document has been approved and merged.\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n- [Design document](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/80)", "CLOSED", 0, "smartcontracts", "2024-09-27T15:21:27Z", "2025-04-02T17:25:22Z", "2025-04-02T17:25:22Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 03:25:10"]

The `FaultDisputeGame` runs the state transition function from some starting state that is known to be valid. We refer to this starting state as the \"anchor state\". In the context of the OP Stack, the anchor state will originally either be the genesis state or the state of the system at some finalized L2 block height that is considered to be correct by social consensus.\r\n\r\n`FaultDisputeGame` contracts pull the current anchor state from the `AnchorStateRegistry` contract. As the system runs, the anchor state is continuously updated to reflect the latest finalized state as viewed by the proof system at any given time. `FaultDisputeGame` instances that resolve in favor of the defender will trigger the `AnchorStateRegistry` to update the anchor state to the newly finalized state.\r\n\r\n# Problem Statement\r\n\r\nThe AnchorStateRegistry can become \"poisoned\" because the ultimate view of state validity currently actually lives inside of the OptimismPortal contract. An anchor state is considered \"poisoned\" if the OptimismPortal contract has blacklisted the dispute game that caused that anchor state to be recognized by the AnchorStateRegistry. Any new FaultDisputeGame contracts that load in this anchor state will operate over a starting state that the OptimismPortal considers to be invalid and will therefore also be considered invalid.\r\n\r\nAlthough a basic mitigation was added in the Granite upgrade that made it possible to reset the anchor state to some different (valid) state, the fundamental problem still remains that poisoned FaultDisputeGame contracts may continue to resolve and further poison the anchor state registry. In this cascading case, the only real solution at the moment is to switch to a new game type as each game type has its own anchor state mapping and therefore is not impacted by any poisoned anchor states in other game types.\r\n\r\nOur problem statement here is therefore that we wish to be able to prevent or mitigate anchor state poisoning more effectively so that we can reduce the surface for issues within the fault proof system as a whole.\r\n\r\n# Project Updates\r\n\r\n- [2024-09-27] Draft design document is available [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/76).\r\n- [2024-09-27] Draft design document is being actively reviewed.\r\n- [2024-10-28] Design document has been approved and merged.\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n- [Design document](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/76)", "CLOSED", 0, "smartcontracts", "2024-09-27T15:17:06Z", "2025-04-02T17:25:22Z", "2025-04-02T17:25:22Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 03:25:10"]

However, it is not 100% accurate, because cross unsafe data is inherently *unsafe* -- It is an optimistic extension of the chain, but could be proven false if the remote chain reorgs.\n\nBut *In Practical Terms*, what is the likelihood of the remote chain experiencing a reorg? Unsafe reorgs on OP Stack Chains are extremely uncommon currently, with only *one* such event happening on OP Mainnet since Bedrock.\n\nWith Interop based block-invalidation, there is a new opportunity for reorgs on chains - block builders who built their unsafe chain from an invalid message can either fruitlessly extend the invalid chain and pay to publish the batch on the L1 so it can be properly replaced. OR, they may choose instead to drop the stalling unsafe chain aggressively.\n\nThere is a vicious cycle here -- the way for Supervisor Checks to fail is for there to be reorgs. And the way for there to be reorgs is for Supervisor Checks to fail. This suggests that under *normal operation* of a superchain, no invalid messages are ever added to blocks. However, *when* an invalid message is added to a block, it opens the door for more invalid messages to get into the pipeline.\n\nThere are going to be emergent behaviors in superchain stability that we should be prepared to respond to with things like Admin APIs and Leadership Transfers. If a recurrence of invalid messages continually affects the block builders ability to advance the chain, we need the tools to stop interop processing to allow networks to resume normal operation. After normal operation resumes, reintroducing Interop Messages functionality would be safe again.\n\nWe need to start getting experience in these kinds of outcomes by using Kurtosis based Devnets plus large scale Network Automation like the NAT framework being developed. In the meantime, we have a number of practical component behaviors that we want to implement which we *believe* will allow for better network response by block builders and the transaction pipeline.\n\n# Documents and their Action Items\n\n[Topology and Tx Flow for Interop chain Operation](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/218/files)\n\n- [ ] `proxyd` to call `checkAccessList` for Transactions with Interop Access Lists\n- [ ] Make Mempool Igress `checkAccessList` Filter configurable (off for sequencers)\n- [ ] Remove block-builder `checkInterop` call\n- [ ] Introduce recurring `checkInterop` batch call in Mempool\n\n[Transaction Handling FMA](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/249)\n\n- [ ] `proxyd` will need a rate-limit feature to avoid overloading the Supervisor\n  - This is because `proxyd` doesn't have an up to date balance view of the sender\n  - the rate limit can be given heuristics to still allow trustable traffic through\n\n[OP Supervisor FMA](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/233/files)\n\n- [ ] Alternative Validation Implementation (Epic]\n- [ ] Higher Quality Testing (Managed in other Work Streams)\n- [ ] Batcher to limit publishing range to Cross-Unsafe\n- [ ] Sequencer to watch for Cross-Unsafe stalls to reorg\n- [ ] Admin API to disable Interop inclusion during incidents\n- [ ] Conductor to use Supervisor Liveness as potential Leadership Transfer trigger\n- [ ] Implement Standard Mode\n- [ ] Standard Mode should accept multiple Supervisors for comparison\n\n", "OPEN", 0, "axelKingsley", "2025-04-02T16:37:19Z", "2025-04-10T12:37:57Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 03:27:16"]

This causes a TypeScript compilation error in strict or recent TS environments:\n\n```ts\nexport const fromHexString = (inp: Buffer | string): Buffer => {\n  if (typeof inp === 'string' && inp.startsWith('0x')) {\n    return Buffer.from(inp.slice(2), 'hex')\n  }\n\n  return Buffer.from(inp)\n}\n```\n\n### \u274c Error\n\n```\nTS2769: No overload matches this call.\nArgument of type 'string | Buffer' is not assignable to parameter of type 'WithImplicitCoercion<string>'.\n```\n\nThe `Buffer.from(...)` overloads expect a **single input type**, not a union, and TypeScript cannot safely infer the correct branch.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Suggested Fix\n\nUpdate the function to explicitly check for the `Buffer` type before calling `Buffer.from(...)`:\n\n```ts\nexport const fromHexString = (inp: Buffer | string): Buffer => {\n  if (Buffer.isBuffer(inp)) {\n    return inp\n  }\n\n  if (typeof inp === 'string' && inp.startsWith('0x')) {\n    return Buffer.from(inp.slice(2), 'hex')\n  }\n\n  return Buffer.from(inp)\n}\n```\n\nThis is fully backwards compatible, improves type safety, and fixes the compilation error.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea Environment\n\n| Tool         | Version     |\n|--------------|-------------|\n| Node.js      | 20.x        |\n| TypeScript   | 5.8.x       |\n| pnpm         | 10.x        |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude4c Willing to Contribute\n\nHappy to open a PR with this fix if helpful.

When pruning, in order to prevent the impact of chain reorganization, the target block height for pruning is set to the bottom-most layer of difflayer by default.

This error will not cause the block to fail, but it will result in a different state hash and block hash after the block is executed. Eventually, when the code reaches https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/blob/ec72ec6a285e85761a21d6700af8c52513fed9eb/eth/catalyst/api.go#L586, an error will be thrown.\r\n\r\n#### My questions are:\r\n1.

This would be a \"two step\" transfer, where you register and finalize, and is meant to exist so that if a register finalizes that shouldn't, we can pause. This would prevent the worst case scenario of an invalid cross chain message finalizing that mints a ton of `ether` from the `ETHLiquidity` contract.\n\nThis would rely on a monitoring service and the ability to pause with a relatively low SLA, because we don't want to make the cross chain send take too long. If we built the two step transfer mechanism in a generic way, then its possible for any app dev to plug into it.\n\nThe major downside of this approach is that we would need to make sure the expiry window works well through a pause, one way to do it would be to `sstore` on a register and `sload` on the execute, so that the `Identifier`/`ExecutingMessage` event emission isn't needed on the execute step.

I think we need a way to add back per-task custom validations, especially those which we now exclude as _expected errors_.\n\nThe new scops task framework works with template Solidity scripts that also define generic validations that run for all tasks. But then it is expected that the on-chain `StandardValidator` returns some errors. E.g. in the case of the Sepolia Unichain Isthmus prestate upgrade (U15), we define the following list of expected erros:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/blob/f42ea91b0951acc67c4453a09b25412789eb2754/src/improvements/tasks/sep/012-opcm-update-prestate-v300-uni/config.toml#L10-L17\n\nBut what's now missing are assertions what these values should be _instead_.

But we don't have any assertions who should be the right PAO instead. **Worst case, this can lead to us ignoring wrong values because we just dismiss this check as an expected error.**\n\nI see two solutions\n1. Add optional validation Solidity scripts to tasks, that would probably inherit the template so all fields and functions are available as they are in the template. So there would be a solidity script for a task like in the old framework, but only optionally. This option solves the problem very generically.\n2. Improve the `StandardValidator` errors to include contextual information, so that the asserted errors also assert on the alternative field values instead. E.g. in the above example, the error code `PROXYA-10` could be extended to include the actually found owner in parenthesis, like `PROXYA-10(0x<actual-address>)`.

Please describe.**\nWe're exploring ways to make identity-based applications easier to build on chains developed with the OP Stack. Currently, integrating decentralized identity systems (such as those from Iden3 or Privado ID) requires manual deployment and configuration, which creates friction for developers looking to build identity-enabled dApps on Optimism-based chains.\n\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nWe propose incorporating [Iden3 identity contracts](https://github.com/iden3/contracts) as **preinstalled contracts** in the OP Stack, similar to the system contracts described [in the Optimism documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/operators/chain-operators/features/preinstalls).\n\nThese contracts form the **core on-chain state and validation layer** required for issuing, proving, and verifying credentials. Including them as preinstalls would make identity primitives available by default in any new OP chain, enabling a broader ecosystem of decentralized identity applications with minimal setup.\n\nThere's no particular documentation regarding how to add contracts as preinstalls but there is issue [#395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions/395) that links to the following [commit](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/commit/c95677184b5e60803f310913326afdbf60d6587e#diff-2b05d0be8d7d8de7870ac51225a0728adeb9a6df9819eaa654c455a23b8f509e) where we can see how the l2 genesis is formed and so inspecting the repository we found the following places where modifications may be needed:\n```\n* contracts-bedrock/src/libraries/Preinstalls.sol\n* contracts-bedrock/test/L2/Preinstalls.t.sol\n* contracts-bedrock/scripts/SetPreinstalls.s.sol\n```\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nNot including a pre-installed identity system means that every developer has to do their own research and manually deploy identity contracts, which leads to fragmentation and reinventing the wheel each time.\n\n**Additional context**\nThis feature request is a byproduct of the [Optimism Mission Request: \u201cZK Toolkit for ZK Application Developers\u201d](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-to-vote-zk-toolkit-for-zk-application-developers/7444). In that Mission, we worked on adapting the Iden3 and Privado ID ecosystems to be fully functional within Optimism. Please take a look at the project in [its main GitHub repository](https://github.com/wakeuplabs-io/opid).\nWith this feature request, we aim to take that work further by making decentralized identity **super easy to use across the entire OP Stack ecosystem.**\nThis proposal supports the broader goal of the ZK Identity Toolkit Mission: to provide developers with a zero-knowledge toolkit that enables trusted, privacy-preserving relationships between apps and users.\nWe believe that making identity infrastructure a native part of the OP Stack will significantly accelerate the development of ZK-powered applications across the Superchain.\n", "OPEN", 0, "wakeuplabs", "2025-04-22T03:42:10Z", "2025-04-22T03:42:10Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 03:32:01"]

["I_kwDODjvEJM6wfXQC", 15128, "[Tracker]: Add impl redundancy to superchain mempool ingress checks", "One problem with op-supervisor is that it's a central point of failure for superchain safety. That is, if op-supervisor were to incorrectly assess the interop safety of a block then nothing else would detect this and the real superchain state would diverge from the \"true\" superchain state. The only thing worse than a chain fork is total consensus on some bad state.\n\nHow do we fix this? By introducing protocol implementation redundancy into the process of determining the real superchain state. The simplest way to do this would be to implement an alternate version of op-supervisor in a \"clean room\" to minimize the chance that any bugs appearing in the second implementation of the supervisor protocol also appear in the first. This would be a large undertaking, and apparently one ChainSafe is working on now.\n\nBut there are smaller steps that we could take that still meaningfully improve the implementation redundancy of the op-supervisor setup. One such way exists within the `supervisor_checkAccesslist` endpoint, which is called by `op-node` and EL client mempool implementations to reduce the chance of including an invalid executing message. \n\nThe implementation could be made more robust by locally introducing redundancy within the call to `checkAccess(acc types.Access, execAt types.ExecutingDescriptor) (eth.BlockID, error)`. Instead of relying exclusively on the chainDB to [execute the access check](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/8c91990820bead891d8744ee9d5cb016ddfdf9a1/op-supervisor/supervisor/backend/backend.go#L428), as below:\n\n```golang\n\t// Check if message exists\n\tbl, err := su.chainDBs.Contains(acc.ChainID, types.ContainsQuery{\n\t\tTimestamp: acc.Timestamp,\n\t\tBlockNum:  acc.BlockNumber,\n\t\tLogIdx:    acc.LogIndex,\n\t\tChecksum:  acc.Checksum,\n\t})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn eth.BlockID{}, err\n\t}\n```\n\n...we could add redundancy to this check by also making `eth_getTransactionReceipt` RPC calls to op-supervisor's managed L2 nodes, and checking that the two results match.\n\nWe can expect this redundant `Contains()` implementation to take strictly longer than the non-redundant DB-based implementation, since the latency introduced by receipt-fetching was the main motivation for maintaining a centralized log of receipts in op-supervisor to begin with. To balance the cost of running `supervisor_checkAccesslist` in this mode against the increased RPC load it would place on an op-supervisor's managed L2 nodes (and hence, denial-of-service risk), we will add a field to the API's request object controlling whether a redundant, synchronous check is enabled, so that the check may be disabled at the outer-most perimeter of the transaction-inclusion pipeline. As pointed out by @protolambda, it is prudent to use the more efficient check on the outer perimeter and the more costly check on the inner perimeter to mitigate potential DOS attacks.\n\nFinally we will update the inner tx-inclusion perimeter caller to `supervisor_checkAccesslist` to pass along this option configuration so that the redundant check is enabled. This inner perimeter caller will likely be the transaction mempool ingress validator, where the outer perimeter caller may be the proxyd instance abstracting over these instances. However, the exact location of the redundant caller is subject to change with the result of the recent [interop topology design](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/blob/main/protocol/interop-topology.md#solution-summary).\n\nTODO:\n* Define exact failure mode that is being mitigated by this solution ([FMA doc](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/blob/f3aa2db64b1676b5e58ae602acf2ebdba34b617c/security/fma-message-passing-contracts.md#fm2-validatemessage-references-an-invalid-or-non-existent-initiated-message))\n* In the words of @axelKingsley:\n  > \"It is a little strange maybe that the Supervisor is checking with its Managed Nodes, when it is responsible for maintaining those nodes in the first place -- like, if a bug would cause the DB to have invalid data, that invalid data has a high likelihood of poisoning the Managed Nodes anyway.

Clear documentation would streamline this process and improve the developer experience.  \n\nThis documentation should provide clarity on available options, especially for key configurations like **Alt-DA mode**, **Fault Proofs**, and other relevant settings.  \n\n## Acceptance criteria  \n- Create a dedicated page or section detailing the **intent file** configuration structure.  \n- Include explanations for each possible property and its values.  \n- Provide examples for common configurations such as enabling/disabling **Fault Proofs** and setting up **Alt-DA mode**.  \n- Ensure documentation aligns with the latest `op-deployer` release.\n- (Optional but ideal) Specify the **`op-deployer`** version that introduces or modifies each configuration property to improve clarity for developers working with older versions.  \n\n## User stories  \n- As an OP Stack chain operator, I want to reference clear documentation for the `op-deployer` intent file so that I can confidently configure my deployment.  \n- As a developer using Alt-DA, I need to know how to set up the intent file to ensure my custom data availability solution is properly integrated.  \n\n## Resources and support  \n- The [`deploy-config`](https://docs.optimism.io/operators/chain-operators/configuration/rollup) documentation serves as a good reference model.  \n\n## Action items  \n- Identify the complete list of intent file properties.  \n- Create documentation with descriptions, value types and examples.\n- Publish the new documentation and update relevant links across the OP Stack documentation site.

It crashes because the Event Queue Sanity limit is reached!\n\nLooking at grafana during startup, it seems like this happens when there is a deep queue of unsafe work to catch up on.\n\nEach Local Unsafe Update triggers:\n- Log Indexing\n- Cross Unsafe updates for *all* chains\n\nAnd furthermore, Log Index Events can snowball. Consider this:\n- Chain A is 1000 blocks behind indexing\n- Chain A notifies supervisor of block 1001, creating an indexing event (Ev1)\n- Supervisor indexes blocks 0-10, and there is more work to do, so Supervisor emits a new event for indexing more (Ev1.1)\n- Chain A notifies supervisor of block 1002, creating an indexing event (Ev2)\n- Ev2 indexes some and creates Ev2.1\n- Ev1.1 indexes some more and creates Ev1.1.1\n- ...\n\nSo it would appear that the Supervisor gains linearly more indexing jobs the further behind it is, as every new Unsafe head discovered creates a cycle of indexing events which may trigger themselves.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25c7bc24-1113-4e1f-89a1-ca79d04448a0)\n\n\nThere are potentially numerous solutions to this problem, ranging in effectiveness and quality:\n- Raise the Queue Sanity Limit: this could get us through some sync issues, but given the linear increase issue documented above, it won't solve everything\n- Utilize prioritization in the Event System to drop unnecessary events when near the limit, or otherwise utilize the rate-limiting features of the Event System. These features are unused so far and may take some integration or other careful consideration to utilize\n- Change the Chain Processor to not create self-triggering cycles when there are already cycles happening.\n\n### Probable Best Solution For Now:\n- When a new indexing event hits the indexer:\n- Check if we are *already* not sync'd up to the target already given (new field called `maxTarget`)\n- If the new target is less than or eq the `maxTarget`, do nothing\n- If the new target is greather than the `maxTarget`, update the max target\n- If the `maxTarget` hasn't been set, allow this event to trigger new work.

The rollup config requires addresses of deployed contracts (e.g. SystemConfig)\n2. But those contracts can\u2019t be deployed until the chain config exists.\n \nWithout this deployment data, a valid prestate cannot be generated for a fresh chain. This prevents the OPCM from deploying a chains with the permissionless dispute game as it requires a prestate (and the only way to change the prestate is to deploy a new game impl, so at that point you might as well just use `opcm.addGameType()`).\n\nA possible solution is to simulate `opcm.deploy()` offchain with a given `DeployInput`. Since we use CREATE2, the resulting `DeployOutput` should be deterministic, giving us the required contract addresses ahead of time. This would allow us to generate the config before actually deploying anything, breaking the cycle.\n\nHistorically, this was more difficult because `op-node` relied on the specific L1 block number for the `SystemConfig` deployment, but it may now introspect SystemConfig directly.\n\nThe other blocker to having a known prestate without deploying L1 contracts is the generation of the L2 Genesis state.

Please describe.**  \nThe **SuperchainERC20** contract currently deploys with the same `initialSupply` across all Superchain networks. This leads to **unexpected supply inflation**, where if a user sets `initialSupply = 1,000,000` on one network, the total supply across all networks becomes `network_count * 1,000,000`.  \n\nThis is problematic because:  \n- It **breaks the expected behavior** of cross-chain tokens, where minting and burning should ensure a unified total supply across all networks.  \n- The **supply is not controlled**, causing economic inconsistencies in tokenomics.  \n- The expected behavior is that a token should start with supply **only on the native chain** and have a `0` supply on all other chains until bridged.  \n\n## **Describe the solution you'd like**  \nTo prevent unintended inflation, I propose modifying the **SuperchainERC20** constructor to include a `nativeChainId` parameter.  \n\n### **Solution**  \n1. **Introduce a `nativeChainId` parameter** in the constructor.  \n2. **Only mint `initialSupply` on the native chain**.  \n3. **Other chains start with `0` supply**, and minting occurs only through bridging.  \n\n### **Code Example:**  \n```solidity\nconstructor(  \n    string memory name,  \n    string memory symbol,  \n    uint256 initialSupply,  \n    uint256 nativeChainId  \n) ERC20(name, symbol) {  \n    if (block.chainid == nativeChainId) {  \n        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);  \n    }  \n}  \n```\n\n- This ensures that `initialSupply` is **only created once** on the native chain.  \n- On all other networks, the **initial supply is 0**, and cross-chain bridge transactions will mint new tokens as needed.  \n\n## **Describe alternatives you've considered**  \n1. **Manually burning tokens on extra networks**  \n   - This is inefficient and requires constant monitoring.  \n   - Users may forget or fail to burn tokens, leading to supply inconsistencies.  \n\n2. **Using a global registry to track deployments**  \n   - More complex and introduces additional overhead.  \n   - Would require an external contract or centralized tracking system.  \n\n3. **Enforcing mint/burn strictly via bridge mechanisms**  \n   - The best long-term solution, but it requires deeper integration with Superchain bridge logic.  \n\n## **Additional Context**  \n- This issue affects **all Superchain networks**, leading to **unexpected inflation** of deployed tokens.  \n- Implementing this fix ensures that **total supply remains predictable and controlled**.  \n- This change aligns **SuperchainERC20** with proper **cross-chain asset management best practices**.  \n\nWould love to hear feedback and thoughts from the team on this proposal! \n", "OPEN", 0, "codeesura", "2025-02-14T14:07:10Z", "2025-05-23T22:43:46Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 04:57:36"]

I.e. it needs to be reorg-aware.\n\nReorgs are just implemented as rewinds + new inserts. So what we really need is some way to acquire a \"lock\" (figurative) as function that we can trust up to block N, do some things, and then check if that block N is still there, with a final check, and error if the state changed. The caller can then retry, until the rewind-lock holds.\n\nIdeally we don't need to register the reorg lock upfront, and can adjust it throughout the function. E.g. at first we might only depend on block 3 to stay around, but then we might need block 5, and at the end we then want 5 to be there. But, as we change from 3 to 5, we don't want to accidentally switch to new reorged chain.\n\nI think we can make this some kind of object, that you can register a `eth.BlockID` against, and then take responsibility over unregistering it (with some defer `myRewindLock.Unregister(blockID)` type of thing. \n\nWe need such lock for each chain, in the `ChainsDB`. The same lock can be shared by cross-safe / local-safe / unsafe / cross-unsafe chain state. Any changes should just invalidate the lock.\nAnd then a `myRewindLock.Check()` function should check the state, at the end of the function, before the deferred `.Unregister(blockID)` is called.\n\nThis way we can have parallel DB operations and no weird blocking, and secure the cross-DB operations from resulting in inconsistent reads. The rewind DB path(s) (I think there are currently two) will have to invalidate the lock.\n\nThis functionality is important for the `AccessList` checks: transactions should not be confirmed with half of the access-list applicable to one state of the chain, and half to the post-reorg state of the same chain.\n", "CLOSED", 0, "protolambda", "2025-03-11T21:14:25Z", "2025-05-30T09:47:08Z", "2025-05-30T09:47:08Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 04:59:36"]

["I_kwDODjvEJM66Hq2P", 16308, "`HazardSetFrontierChecks` doesn't flag an error if hazard is not the cross-safe candidate for its chain", "When cross-validating a cross-safe candidate for an L2 chain, the Supervisor is expected to check that each element in the candidate's hazard set is either (a) already validated as cross-safe, or (b) the cross-safe candidate for its own chain. However, currently the code allows hazards with a block number after their chain's cross-safe candidate to pass the check.\n\n### Details\n\nIn the `HazardSafeFrontierChecks` function, if an element `hazardBlock` of the hazard set is not yet in the cross-safe database, it retrieves the cross-safe candidate for its chain and checks for errors:\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/514ecce3c43457543ee35ad7d18e6deb0481293a/op-supervisor/supervisor/backend/cross/safe_frontier.go#L37-L49\n\nIn line 42, the if statement returns an `ErrConflict` if `hazardBlock` has the same block number as `candidate` but different ID. However, there is no check preventing the case where `hazardBlock` has a different block number from `candidate`, which can happen if `hazardBlock` is a later block and the processing of the cross-safe head hasn't reached it yet.\n\nSince this allows a hazard set to pass the checks even if it has an element that is neither marked as cross-safe nor the cross-safe candidate, this might cause a block to be promoted to cross-safe when it shouldn't.\n\n### Example Scenario\n\n1. Chain A is trying to update its cross-safe head to block A1. A1 includes an executing message referencing an initiating message in block B2 of Chain B, so B2 is added to A1's hazard set.\n2. Chain B's cross-safe candidate is B1, which is B2's parent.\n3. When validating the hazard set for A1, we retrieve the cross-safe candidate B1 for Chain B. B1 and B2 have different block numbers, but no error is flagged even though B2 is neither marked as cross-safe nor the cross-safe candidate.\n4. A1 is promoted to cross-safe.\n5. Later, when Chain B tries to advance the cross-safe head, it realizes that B1 has a conflict and needs to be invalidated. As a consequence, B2 is invalidated as well. Therefore, since it depends on an invalid block, A1 should not have been promoted to cross-safe either.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nIn addition to the existing checks, check if `candidate.Derived.Number < hazardBlock.Number`, and return `ErrFuture` if this is the case, to indicate that we need to wait for the cross-safe head in Chain B to catch up before we can cross-validate the next candidate for Chain A.", "OPEN", 0, "lucasmt", "2025-06-05T20:31:40Z", "2025-06-05T20:45:56Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 05:01:21"]

Below PRs are the step-by-step evolvement of this op-node side logic:\n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16052 (unsafe head reset was ignored so fixed)\n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16312 (optimization: search correct unsafe head backwards)\n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16276 (optimization: binary search correct unsafe head)\n\nWe want to reduce complexity and isolate the responsibility of the determinism of correct reset target at op-supervisor.\n\nWhen we **move the correct unsafe-head finding logic for reset from op-node to op-supervisor**, we solve because https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16314 because it brings consistency; op-supervisor is responsible for all safety levels to reset, and also solve https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16315 because while calculating the correct local unsafe reset target from the op-supervisor, op-supervisor must track correct L1 and check L1 origin to determine the target unsafe head to reset, and finally solve https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16321 since if a reorg happens, previously correct unsafe blocks will become invalid because their L1 origin will be invalidated(by choosing option 2 at the #16321 issue).\n\n### Goal\n\n**Move the correct unsafe-head finding logic for reset from op-node to op-supervisor** by\n- checking target unsafe's L1 origin validation at the op-supervisor, before we send it to op-node.\n- we may trigger reset on the op-supervisor side to update to unsafe head having correct L1 origin (cherry picked from https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16315)\n- we may handle the unsafe-head finding logic different between pre/post interop differently because op-supervisor does not have unsafe DB for pre-interop. (cherry picked from https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16314)\n\n### Codepath\n\nRelevant codepath that needs to be visited:\n\n1. op-supervisor consumes `supervisorTypes.ManagedEvent{Reset}`\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/ad69223dd421566609d710405393128489b6facd/op-supervisor/supervisor/backend/syncnode/node.go#L268-L270\n2. `resetFullRange()` is called, fetching latest local safe in supervisor db\n3. `initiateReset()` is called, binary searching between the activation block and latest local safe, finding the reset target.\n4. `resetHeadsFromTarget()` is called\n- based on the reset target, it determines {localUnsafe, crossUnsafe, localSafe, crossSafe, finalized}. Currently the local safe is set to target:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/ad69223dd421566609d710405393128489b6facd/op-supervisor/supervisor/backend/syncnode/reset.go#L82-L86\n\nWe now update the comment and pick the latest possible unsafe target at the op-supervisor.\nop-supervisor tracks all relevant info, unsafe head and L1 blocks so it is possible to determine the precise unsafe head.\n\n5. op-node will receive the `Reset()` request from the op-supervisor and will trust the op-supervisor provided unsafe head and only validates against its target EL, like other heads like\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/ad69223dd421566609d710405393128489b6facd/op-node/rollup/interop/managed/system.go#L420-L424\n\n\n\n\n\n", "OPEN", 0, "pcw109550", "2025-06-20T12:56:13Z", "2025-06-24T14:42:05Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 06:27:47"]

TBD in how far this is already being taken care of by the Rewinder or in how far it interferes with the Rewinder.\n\nNote that this is also closely related to #16314.

Sync stops working properly. The node appears connected but stops progressing with peers. We suspect an issue with how libp2p/yamux sessions are handled or cleaned up.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n\n1. Start `op-node` v1.13.3 using the official image `us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-node:v1.13.3` (based on Alpine Linux 3.20).\n2. Let it run for 6\u201312 hours in a production setup with inbound/outbound peer traffic.\n3. Inspect goroutines using `kill -ABRT $(pidof op-node)` or `pprof`.\n4. Observe thousands of goroutines in stuck state, many coming from `libp2p`, `yamux`, or `p2p.(*SyncClient).peerLoop`.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nGoroutines should terminate or be cleaned up if the stream or peer becomes inactive or broken.

It then hits a temp error and returns, but it never set any field in the `d.latest BuildingState`, which only happens at the end right before emitting a `BuildStartEvent`. This temp error then lands in `onEngineTemporaryError` where it checks if there's any non-zero `BuildState` at `d.latest` to make the decision whether the \"sequencer is using the engine\", and then returns early because it's still clear, so no future action is scheduled.", "CLOSED", 0, "sebastianst", "2024-10-02T10:42:37Z", "2025-07-16T23:22:31Z", "2025-07-16T23:22:31Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 06:31:39"]

But even if the op-batcher becomes operational, it's hard to recover batch submission and chain derivation because new batches will be likely dropped. This issue includes details of the situation and proposed solution.\r\n\r\n## Details of the incident\r\n1. For some reason, batches are not submitted for a while and the sequence window expired.\r\n2. op-node generates empty batches and safe head is advanced with empty blocks. Chain reorg occurs.\r\n3. Sequencer builds new blocks after generated empty blocks.\r\n4. op-batcher makes the next batch from the its current safe head and submit the batch. \r\n5. While the new batch is built and submitted to the L1, op-node generates next empty blocks and reorged again.\r\n6. The new batch will be dropped by following reasons:\r\n  i. If the batch has non-empty blocks, it would not be canonical blocks after new empty blocks.\r\n  ii. If the batch has only empty blocks and the batch is a span batch, the first block of span batch is already over sequence window. So the entire batch is dropped.\r\n\r\nRepeat 2~6\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have to do following things manually to recover the chain from the incident.\r\n 1. Block new user TX submissions.\r\n 2. Empty sequencer's TX pool.\r\n 3. Run op-batcher as a singular batch mode until the chain derivation is recovered.\r\n\r\nWe may add these steps to the runbook, but we can improve system to automate these steps.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n1. Define a new state of op-node which indicates \"Currently sequence window is expired and generating empty batches\". Let's say this as `incident mode` for now.\r\n2. `incident mode` is enabled when the op-node generates empty block. and disabled when the op-node derives new block from L1 batch.\r\n3. If the op-node is in `incident mode`, sequencer builds empty blocks by setting `NoTxPool` as `true`.\r\n4. `incident mode` is included as a boolean value in the `optimism_syncStatus` RPC response.\r\n5. op-batcher can check if the op-node is `incident mode` by `syncStatus` RPC. If the op-node is in `incident mode`, op-batcher builds singular batch even if it's running as a span batch mode. (Or we can make it build span batch far from the current safe head to avoid sequence window expiration)\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nThis change can automate the incident recovery of OP stack chains, but it may be a bit risky because it's touching a lot of important features like sequencing and batch submission. Because this incident situation is very unlikely, we can consider more manual way to recover the system from the incident.", "CLOSED", 0, "ImTei", "2024-07-24T22:05:32Z", "2025-07-16T23:21:04Z", "2025-07-16T23:21:04Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 06:31:39"]

And too difficult to roll back efficiently.\n\nInstead, we can mock the execution-layer: by serving the engine API, we can make the CL sync. And we can still serve real blocks; the mock engine API is just a mask over the real chain, to make it appear out of sync.\n\n### spec\n\nThis is a new top-level standalone service, with the regular metrics/CLI/RPC setup. See op-faucet for a minimal example.\n\nIt serves an RPC to pretend to be an execution engine (we can use JSON-RPC auth, so we can hide the RPC behind a JWT secret, for CI).\n\nRPC methods to serve:\n- `eth_getBlockReceipts`: serve if `block num < test_head`\n- `eth_getBlockByHash`: serve if `block num < test_head`\n- `eth_getBlockByNumber`: serve if `block num < test_head`\n- `engine_newPayload{V1,V2,V3,V4}`: check that the payload matches the real one. Error if it does not, and abort the sync test.\n- `engine_getPayload{V1,V2,V3,V4}`: return the block that matches the expected block from the block-building job arguments.\n- `engine_forkchoiceUpdated{V1,V2,V3}`: check if the forkchoice hashes are canonical. Update the `test_head`, `test_safe`, `test_finalized` in-memory forkchoice values. And check if the block-building attributes (if any) match the inputs to the actual block.\n- We should NOT have to support `eth_getStorageAt`, but might if we expand with pre-isthmus fault-proof scope.\n- No other RPC methods\n\nAnd for block-label queries, mock `latest = test_head`, and `safe = test_safe`, `finalized = test_finalized`.\n\nDuring the sync test, whenever some expectation is broken, abort the test.\n\nAlso add the option for an artificial processing delay per RPC method, so we can test what a slow execution engine feels like.\n\nAs follow-up in a later iteration of the op-sync-tester we can also mock random errors, like saying the node is syncing, or some temporary error.\n\n### Test Sessions\n\nIf we want, we can use the dynamic HTTP routing to make `/synctest?head=100&safe=95&finalized=90` map to a sync-test RPC session.\nThis way the service never has to restart; different testers can use it in parallel, all with their own test-view of the chain. \n\nOptionally we can support more query params too, e.g. to setup a sync test for the last N blocks, or to select a random range of blocks.\n\nOptionally we can also add an upper-bound, so that the engine API stops responding after reaching a certain block number. This way the test can end more naturally without consuming the full chain.\n\nThe RPC utils in op-service already support access to the HTTP router that serves the websocket.\n\nWe should add a middle-ware option that parses the HTTP query parameters, and attaches them to the `ctx` that is then passed down to the RPC handlers. And attach some mutable session storage, for the sync progress and latest known block-building random payloadID and attributes.\n\nThe RPC handlers can then determine the session from the `ctx` (if we add session middleware, or just use the requester address), as well as the session config / mutable data.\nAnd then just update that session; no global singleton state.\n\n### Usage\n\n- deploy in kurtosis (low priority)\n- deploy in devstack sysgo (for testing the test tool)\n- deploy stand-alone for CI or local dev: configure in k8s once, on a public endpoint with some auth (maybe even multiple auth tokens), and allow anyone with the auth to sync-test against it.\n\nBoth the Rust stack and the Go L2 stack should be able to sync-test against this.\n\n", "OPEN", 0, "protolambda", "2025-06-16T19:21:34Z", "2025-07-25T23:03:37Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-08-31 06:33:18"]

This is because the chain is currently waiting on additional data before it can become cross safe, and for the batcher to post this data early exposes the risk that this data *will never* become cross-unsafe, which will create a block replacement as a downstream effect.\n\nThe batcher should accept an admin API which sets which head is being tracked, or a runtime flag. Avoiding posting data which isn't cross-unsafe will lead to fewer replacements, but may also lead to safe head stalls, so controlling this behavior will be valuable.\n\n## When should we do this / Blockers\n\nRestricting the Batch contents to `cross-unsafe` means that invalid blocks won't ever be posted to the L1, thus eliminating the chances of a block Invalidation/Replacement.\n\nHowever, if implemented without further handling, this could cause stalls: If there is an invalid message in the unsafe chain, the batcher will eventually run out of data to post to the L1, creating a safe-head stall. Simultaneously, the Sequencer doesn't have any way to fix the invalid message. So the unsafe chain is *invalid*, and the safe chain is *stalled*\n\nWe can fix this by doing one of the following:\n- Allow Sequencers to issue unsafe chain reorgs. Today, nodes expect the Sequencer \"not to equivocate\", and so they only ever accept the first block they see from it. This means the Sequencer is bound to that output, and can't actually affect the network.

It could only happen with explicit malicious intent, and would only affect nodes that accidentally restarted mid-way through derivation from a given L1 block.\r\n\r\nThe background is that with Holocene, overlapping singular batches, even if coming from a span batch, are not checked to match the existing safe chain. Past batches are simply fast-dropped. Before holocene, the span batch checks would fetch all overlapping L2 blocks fully and match that the batches' content (transactions, L1 origin, ...) match the blocks' content.\r\n\r\nI beliebe that even pre-Holocene, this can be exploited with singular batches in two closely following batcher transactions, because past singular batches are also fast dropped (details following soon).\r\n- [ ] Action test showing mid-way derivation restart exploit pre-Holocene\r\n\r\n~This change fixes another issue of the current Holocene derivation. Currently, if a batch in a span batch is invalid, or the payload derived from it is invalid, the remaining channel is dropped, so derivation might never processes a batch with the `IsLastInSpan` boolean set to `true`, so the pending safe head would fail to be promoted to safe, even though it can already be considered safe, as no backwards- invalidation occurs.~ (fixed separately in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/12724)\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that with this change, pending safe would have a slightly different meaning post-Holocene. Pre-Holocene, the pending safe was pending in the sense that it may well be reverted by a later invalid batch causing a revert of the full span batch. This is not the case any more with Holocene. Pending safe becomes more of an implementation detail to protect against inconsistent state from mid-way derivation restarts.

However, when we reset to a safe block's l1 origin and start deriving from it, the origin block itself cannot contain any new batches. So when we are at the point of checking batch validity, we have advanced the L1 origin at least one block, so we should always have 2 L1 blocks available.

This is a bit confusing for someone trying to follow the process step-by-step.  \n\nSecondly, after installing `op-deployer`, I noticed that there's only an executable file and no `bin` folder or `op-deployer` directory as implied in the tutorial. The instructions mention commands like `cd op-deployer` and `./bin/op-deployer`, which don't seem to align with what's actually installed.

This is not the default behavior of op-acceptor, in order to enable this the `--allow-skips` flag must be passed.\n\nIn certain contexts however, we do not want to trust the test to check its preconditions. In these contexts if the test precondition were to fail erroneously and cause the rest of the test assertions to be skipped, this would be difficult to catch and the possibility of this would degrade the trustworthiness of acceptance test run.\n\nIf we accept that not all tests will be compatible with all test targets and that we prefer to disable skips in certain contexts, then we must have test target-specific gates in `acceptance-tests.yaml`, e.g. `interop-sysgo`, `interop-kurtosis`. To actually run the gates, also have various corresponding recipes in the `op-acceptance-tests/justfile` which do appropriate test target setup, op-acceptor invocation with corresponding gate configuration, and teardown. The result works, but is somewhat clunky. op-acceptor gate configuration is broken up across this `acceptance-tests.yaml` and the `justfile`.\n\nIt would be nice if test target setup/teardown was a first-class concern of op-acceptor, allowing the user to configure which test targets are supported for a given gate in the `acceptance-tests.yaml`, and allowing the user to invoke op-acceptor directly, rather than through an intermediate justfile recipe. This would also pave the way for running op-acceptor against different test targets within a single run, which is a necessary process for discovering/debugging compatibility between acceptance tests and network-setups.", "CLOSED", 0, "teddyknox", "2025-05-21T20:25:57Z", "2025-08-21T20:48:45Z", "2025-08-21T20:48:44Z", "ethereum-optimism/infra", "2025-08-31 08:02:44"]

Similar approach is done for L1 like [tx_fuzzer](https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/tx-fuzz), and containerized as [ethpandaops/tx-fuzz](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethpandaops/tx-fuzz) and added to [ethpandaops/ethereum-package](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package/).\n\nWe need some kind of fuzzing tool like [tx_fuzzer](https://github.com/ethpandaops/optimism-package/issues/186) which generates cross chain messages(initating messages + validating messages) to enable this for interop.\n\n## Current Status for interop tx fuzzing\n\n[ethpandaops/optimism-package](https://github.com/ethpandaops/optimism-package/) has an [open issue](https://github.com/ethpandaops/optimism-package/issues/186) that enables tx fuzzing targeting to single L2 network.

Have also seen instances of it missing events near the end of the block range but including the latest events, which seems very odd. Haven't been able to confirm if it will happen when calling for 1 block at a time yet.\n\nAlso noticing occasional huge latencies (double digit seconds) on this call, when made with sub100 block ranges, with all other calls we make to our node performing fine. Latency spikes are occurring during volatility == more on-chain activity.\n\nHere's a simple python script which reproduces the issue very consistently on our node - usually seeing an error within 5-10 blocks, although sometimes longer.

For light clients and zk-based systems (e.g. Colibri stateless clients), this is a major efficiency bottleneck.\n\n---\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nDefine the signature message using an **SSZ container and its `hash_tree_root`**, similar to Ethereum consensus:\n\n```python\nclass SequencerCommitment(Container):\n    parent_beacon_block_root: Bytes32\n    execution_payload_header: ExecutionPayloadHeader\n````\n\nThen the signing root becomes:\n\n```\nkeccak256(\n    domain ++ chain_id ++ hash_tree_root(SequencerCommitment)\n)\n```\n\nThis enables:\n\n* **Merkle-friendly proofs**: clients can verify only the necessary fields.\n* **Smaller proofs**: no need to transmit the full payload, only Merkle branches.\n* **Consistency with Ethereum consensus**: aligns with how signing roots are already defined.\n* **Forward-compatibility**: SSZ evolution is safer than raw byte hashing.\n\n---\n\n**Describe alternatives you\u2019ve considered**\n\n* **Status quo**: keep `keccak(payload)` \u2013 works but bloats proofs and prevents efficient verification.\n* **Application-layer Merkleization**: replicate hashing on top of the keccak payload, but this duplicates work and doesn\u2019t integrate cleanly with existing SSZ tooling.\n\n---\n\n**Additional context**\n\n* Current spec reference: [[Rollup Node P2P \u2013 Block signatures](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/rollup-node-p2p.html)](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/rollup-node-p2p.html)\n* Ethereum SSZ reference: [SSZ hash\\_tree\\_root](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/ssz/)\n* Backwards compatibility path: introduce a **new topic/domain (e.g. v5)**, sequencers can dual-sign during migration, clients accept both formats.\n\nThis change would drastically reduce proof sizes and make OP Stack more compatible with stateless light clients and zk-provers.\n\n", "OPEN", 0, "simon-jentzsch", "2025-09-21T19:40:34Z", "2025-09-21T19:40:34Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/specs", "2025-10-13 20:34:58"]

The choice of `from` affects the deployment address of the contract. Using a fresh account means we can safely set `nonce:0` in the upgrade transaction. \n\nThat unique account tends to be chosen in the `0x421...` namespace. Choosing it correctly involves checking the entire spec history to ensure we aren't reusing an address. This is error prone, particularly when forks get reordered. \n\nA better pattern is \n\n> take the first 20 bytes of the source hash as sender address. That way you have a guaranteed unique deployer address, and thus nonce 0, and thus a unique and deterministic deployed contract address.

This results in severely degraded transaction throughput.\n**Root Cause**: The payload.interrupt atomic variable is shared across multiple payload building cycles within the same Payload object. Once the Consensus Layer calls payload.resolve() and sets the interrupt signal to commitInterruptResolve (4), all subsequent recommit update builds immediately abort in commitTransactions() without processing any transactions.\n\n**Current Behavior**\n```\n// First build - works fine\ncommitTransactions start currentTxCount=1 initialInterruptSignal=0\n// ... processes transactions normally\n\n// CL calls resolve(), sets interrupt=4\n\n// Recommit update build - immediately fails\ncommitTransactions start currentTxCount=1 initialInterruptSignal=4\ncommitTransactions interrupted signal=4 processedTxs=0\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\nRecommit updates should be able to process transactions from the pool, not immediately abort due to stale interrupt signals from previous resolve calls.\n\n**Solution**\nReset resolve interrupt signals at the beginning of each generateWork call to allow recommit mechanism to function properly.\n**File**: `miner/worker.go`\n**Function**: `generateWork`\nAdd interrupt signal reset logic before `fillTransactions`:\n```\n// Smart interrupt signal handling\ninterrupt := genParam.interrupt\nif interrupt == nil {\n    interrupt = new(atomic.Int32)\n} else {\n    // Reset resolve interrupt at the start of all builds\n    currentSignal := interrupt.Load()\n    if currentSignal == commitInterruptResolve {\n        // Reset resolve interrupt to allow build to continue\n        interrupt.Store(commitInterruptNone)\n        log.Info(\"Reset resolve interrupt for new build\", \"oldSignal\", currentSignal, \"isUpdate\", genParam.isUpdate)\n    }\n    // For update builds, also reset any non-None signal to prevent delayed interrupts\n    if genParam.isUpdate && currentSignal != commitInterruptNone {\n        interrupt.Store(commitInterruptNone)\n        log.Info(\"Reset interrupt for update build\", \"oldSignal\", currentSignal)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Impact**\nFixes recommit mechanism: Update builds can now process transactions instead of immediately aborting\nImproves transaction throughput: Blocks can include transactions from the pool via recommit updates\nMaintains safety: Other interrupt types (timeout, new head) still work as expected\nBackward compatible: No changes to external APIs or behavior", "CLOSED", 0, "louisliu2048", "2025-09-25T02:06:14Z", "2025-09-25T10:19:15Z", "2025-09-25T10:19:15Z", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "2025-10-13 20:35:39"]

This allows for a more modular management of these addresses than the static overrides of `getAllowedStorageAccess` and `getCodeException`.\n\nI propose that we just merge this contract into `JsonTxBuilderBase`, and set its getters to just return those arrays, instead of setting default virtual getters that revert. The getters can still be `virtual` so that they can be overridden, which mostly provides backwards compatibility for the old pattern where individual tasks had to override the getters.

Rather, there is logic within the `superchain` package to inherit/populate some values (namely hardfork activation timestamps and some superchain-wide contract addresses) from the appropriate superchain.toml file. This creates some confusion about how a chain is configured when looking at any given `ChainConfig` file. We would like to get rid of the inheritance so that the `ChainConfig` is a fully, self-contained set of information about the chain.\n\n## Tradeoffs\n\n1. Duplicated data across chain configs - worth this tradeoff to be explicit and avoid confusion\n2. Difficult to tell how a chain diverges from default values if default values are not excluded - could alleviate this concern by adding a simple command to the superchain-registry/ops module which could print out the diff?\n```\n./ops default-diffs <chain_id>\n```\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n1. All current chain configs contain all hardfork timestamp activations for their chain\n2. All current chain configs contain all contract addresses for their chain\n3. ops command exists to propagate new superchain hardfork timestamps to chains who want to inherit them (i.e. `superchain_time` is set)\n4. ops command exists to show diff between chain config and defaults: `./ops default-diffs <chain_id>`", "OPEN", 0, "bitwiseguy", "2024-12-10T19:15:19Z", "2025-09-05T16:09:08Z", null, "ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry", "2025-10-13 20:36:11"]
