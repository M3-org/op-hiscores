["week_2025-08-31", "week", "2025-08-31", "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week, the project made significant strides on two fronts: clearing historical technical debt by closing numerous long-standing issues, and laying the groundwork for the next generation of fault proofs with extensive planning for the \"Kona + Cannon\" upgrade. This dual effort enhances current stability while accelerating progress toward future protocol milestones.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Preparing for Next-Generation Fault Proofs**\n*This work is critical for advancing the security and decentralization of the OP Stack and the Superchain.*\n-   Extensive planning and coordination occurred across multiple teams to define the requirements for integrating the new \"Kona + Cannon\" fault proof system. This involved specifying changes to the dispute monitor, contract manager, and prestate tooling ([design-docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs), [superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops), [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth)).\n-   Initial design work began for an \"aggregate dispute game,\" representing the next step in fault proof innovation ([optimism#17305](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17305)).\n\n**Strengthening Engineering Foundations and Developer Velocity**\n*Improving our internal tools and testing frameworks allows us to build and ship higher-quality features more quickly and reliably.*\n-   A major overhaul of the testing infrastructure was completed, unifying acceptance tests into a single workflow and migrating them to a more robust environment ([optimism#16755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16755)).\n-   CI regression tests were made 40% faster, significantly speeding up the development feedback loop ([superchain-ops#1178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1178)).\n-   Standardized tool versioning was introduced to ensure all developers work with a consistent environment, reducing setup friction ([infra#452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/452)).\n-   A large volume of historical issues related to past initiatives like Drippie and Cannon were closed, clearing technical debt and focusing the team on current priorities ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).\n\n**Enhancing the Superchain Ecosystem and Network Stability**\n*Growing the ecosystem and ensuring the core protocol is stable are essential for attracting users, developers, and new chains to the Superchain.*\n-   The Superchain Token List was expanded with four new tokens (ARCv2, MITY, CIOTX, FORT), increasing asset availability on networks like Base ([ethereum-optimism.github.io](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io)).\n-   A critical bug affecting L1 ownership transfers for Worldchain was resolved, restoring key functionality ([superchain-ops#1176](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1176)).\n-   `op-geth` was synchronized with the latest `go-ethereum v1.16.2` release, ensuring it benefits from upstream improvements and security updates ([op-geth#663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/663)).\n-   A design for a critical Superchain upgrade fix was completed, enhancing protocol security ([design-docs#310](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/310)).\n\n**Advancing Public Goods Funding and Community Tooling**\n*Building sustainable mechanisms for funding public goods and providing value to the community are core to our mission.*\n-   Work began on a more generic, season-agnostic framework for Retro Public Goods Funding calculations, starting with the scaffold for Season 8 ([Retro-Funding#74](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/74)).\n-   A major initiative was launched to modernize the Optimism marketing site with a new tech stack, aiming to improve our web presence ([ecosystem#937](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/937)).\n-   New analytical outputs were generated for five OP Chains, providing deeper insights into network activity ([op-analytics#1740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1740)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n**Kona + Cannon Fault Proof Integration**\n-   **Goal:** To prepare the entire OP Stack for a major upcoming protocol upgrade that introduces a new fault proof system.\n-   **Coordination:** This week saw intensive, cross-repository discussions to define the technical requirements for this upgrade. Teams working on `op-geth`, `design-docs`, `superchain-ops`, `infra`, and other core repositories collaborated to scope out necessary changes to components like the Optimism Portal Contract Manager (OPCM), the dispute monitor (`op-dispute-mon`), and prestate management tooling. This coordinated planning ensures that all parts of the system will be ready for the new `cannon-kona` game type, preventing integration issues and ensuring a smooth rollout.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### ethereum-optimism/optimism\n-   Completed a major overhaul of the testing infrastructure by unifying acceptance tests into a single workflow ([#16755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16755), [#16817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16817)) and migrating key tests to Devstack ([#16920](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16920), [#17300](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17300)).\n-   Introduced feature flagging capabilities into the `SystemConfig` contract, allowing for more controlled rollouts of new protocol features ([#17281](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17281)).\n-   Cleared significant technical debt by closing a large volume of historical issues related to the Drippie automation system ([#12876](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12876)), Cannon VM development ([#13969](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13969)), and the Stage 1.4 shipping checklist ([#15827](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15827)).\n-   Identified a critical bug in `op-node` P2P gossip configuration that could cause panics in tests ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17308)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops\n-   Improved CI performance by 40% through optimizations that reduced process concurrency and skipped unnecessary test steps ([#1177](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1177), [#1178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1178)).\n-   Fixed a critical bug for Worldchain by correcting the nonce used for L1 ownership transfers ([#1176](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1176)).\n-   Began preparations for network upgrades by opening pull requests to bring Zora Sepolia ([#1180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1180)), Metal Sepolia ([#1181](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1181)), and Mode Sepolia ([#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1182)) to the U16 release.\n\n### ethereum-optimism/op-geth\n-   Synchronized the codebase with upstream by merging `go-ethereum v1.16.2`, ensuring `op-geth` includes the latest improvements and security patches ([#663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/663)).\n-   Began investigating new reports of a `leveldb panic` when using large genesis files ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/668)) and high latency with `eth_getLogs` RPC calls ([#667](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/667)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/infra\n-   Improved test infrastructure by refactoring the `op-acceptor` test runner into more modular components ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/448)) and enhancing test logging ([#453](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/453)).\n-   Introduced `mise` for standardized tool version management across the repository, improving developer experience and environment consistency ([#452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/452)).\n-   Stabilized the devnet testing environment by resolving several long-standing issues related to porting and setting up acceptance tests ([#440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/440), [#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/398)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/ecosystem\n-   Kicked off a major initiative to migrate the Optimism marketing site to a modern Next.js and TypeScript stack, with detailed planning issues created to guide the effort ([#937](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/937)).\n-   Completed a branding refresh by rolling out consistent font updates across several ecosystem websites, including `app.optimism.io` and `docs.optimism.io` ([#922](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/922), [#923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/923)).\n-   Streamlined the repository by externalizing the `verbs` packages into their own dedicated repository ([#946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/946)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io\n-   Expanded the Superchain Token List with the addition of ARCv2 ([#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1184)), MITY ([#1185](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1185)), CIOTX ([#1191](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1191)), and FORT ([#1194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1194)).\n-   Streamlined chain data management by deciding to leverage", "2025-10-13T20:40:54.797Z"]
