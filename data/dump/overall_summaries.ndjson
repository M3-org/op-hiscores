Significant effort was dedicated to improving how the dispute monitoring service handles out-of-sync nodes, a critical step in ensuring the integrity of the Superchain and preventing false alarms.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening Protocol Security and Reliability**\n*This initiative is vital for maintaining the integrity of the OP Stack, ensuring that the dispute resolution process\u2014a cornerstone of optimistic rollups\u2014functions correctly under all network conditions.*\n-   A critical discussion was initiated to make the dispute monitoring system smarter, preventing it from raising false alarms when network nodes are temporarily lagging in synchronization ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).\n-   Work began on improving how nodes synchronize data across the network, making the entire system more resilient and data-consistent ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).\n-   Progress was made to tighten security filters in the infrastructure's validation components, further hardening the system against potential issues ([ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n**Diagnosing and Solving a Core Security Challenge**\n-   Teams from both the core protocol and infrastructure repositories collaborated on a critical issue to define a robust solution for the dispute monitoring system. This joint effort ensures that a key security component of the OP Stack behaves correctly when encountering nodes with synchronization delays, preventing incorrect dispute resolutions and bolstering trust in the network.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### ethereum-optimism/optimism\n-   Opened a significant new issue ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814)) to address how `op-dispute-mon` handles out-of-sync rollup RPCs, sparking a key discussion on improving the system's reliability.\n-   Proposed adding ELSync gap filling to `op-node` ([#17751](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17751)) to improve data synchronization resilience.\n-   Enhanced the stability of the dispute monitor by better handling \"not found\" scenarios ([#17825](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17825)).\n-   Updated the Optimism Contract Management (`opcm`) tool to support V2 contracts ([#17782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17782)), ensuring compatibility with the latest protocol upgrades.\n-   Streamlined the `opcm` codebase by removing an unused variable ([#17828](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17828)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/infra\n-   Initiated work to introduce stricter exclusion gates within the `op-acceptor` ([#490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/490)), aiming to improve the component's filtering capabilities and security.\n-   Participated in a key technical discussion on issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814) to find a robust solution for the `op-dispute-mon`'s behavior with out-of-sync nodes, highlighting a proactive focus on infrastructure reliability.", "2025-10-18T23:29:21.990Z"]

This foundational work ran in parallel with extensive preparations for the upcoming Jovian network upgrade, ensuring the Superchain remains stable, secure, and ready for its next evolution.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Bolstering Core Infrastructure and Testing**\n*To increase development velocity and ensure the long-term reliability of the OP Stack, we invested heavily in our internal tooling, testing frameworks, and continuous integration (CI/CD) pipelines.*\n-   The testing framework was significantly expanded to cover more network configurations and increase fuzz testing for core smart contracts, improving protocol robustness. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism))\n-   The CI/CD pipeline was optimized by migrating away from self-hosted runners and improving artifact management, leading to faster and more reliable builds. ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism))\n-   A new automated workflow was introduced to build and attest `op-geth` releases, enhancing the security and integrity of the client software. ([ethereum-optimism/op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth))\n-   A persistent tooling installation error was resolved, and a security update was applied to core infrastructure, improving stability for developers and operators. ([ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra))\n\n**Preparing the Superchain for the Jovian Upgrade**\n*To ensure a smooth and secure transition for the entire ecosystem, we finalized preparations for the upcoming Jovian (U17) network upgrade.*\n-   Extensive configuration and documentation updates were completed for the Base Sepolia and Sepolia stacks, ensuring all chains are prepared for the upgrade. ([ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops))\n-   New release notices for the Jovian upgrade were published, keeping node operators and the community informed of the upcoming changes. ([ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs))\n-   A critical testing milestone was achieved across the stack, confirming that proof validation for the Jovian upgrade is successfully integrated and running automatically. ([ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra), [ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs), [ethereum-optimism/op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth), [ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops), [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), [ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry))\n\n**Improving Developer and Operator Experience**\n*To empower builders and support the network, we enhanced our documentation and tooling, making it easier to develop on and operate Optimism-powered chains.*\n-   The Actions SDK documentation was significantly expanded with new reference pages for wallet integration and API usage, providing developers with more comprehensive resources. ([ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs))\n-   The node troubleshooting guide was improved to help operators more easily diagnose issues with their infrastructure. ([ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs))\n-   Support for zstd compression was added to `op-acceptor` images, improving data handling efficiency for infrastructure operators. ([ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra))\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n**Jovian Upgrade Readiness**\nA coordinated effort across multiple teams ensured the ecosystem is prepared for the Jovian network upgrade. The `superchain-ops` team managed the low-level configuration changes, the `docs` team handled public communication, and a key testing issue ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17303)) was closed across six repositories, confirming that automated action tests are in place to validate the upgrade's integrity.\n\n**Shared Protocol Optimization Efforts**\nDiscussions on improving core protocol performance and safety took place across the project. A key topic was the optimization of `op-node`'s communication with the execution layer to reduce \"FCU spam\" ([#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15393)).

We executed a massive, project-wide initiative to clean up technical debt and streamline backlogs, enhancing developer focus and efficiency. Simultaneously, we laid the formal groundwork for significant new capabilities, including ZK game integration and a Light Consensus Layer, positioning the OP Stack for its next phase of growth.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Improving Project Health and Developer Focus**\n_Goal: To increase development velocity and long-term stability by systematically reducing technical debt and clarifying our current work priorities._\n- A massive backlog grooming effort was completed across nearly all repositories, closing hundreds of outdated or resolved issues related to test flakiness, deprecated features, and node stability.\n- A coordinated review of the codebase identified outstanding tasks previously tracked only in code comments (`TODOs`). These were converted into formal issues to ensure they are properly addressed, improving transparency and accountability ([optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry), [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs), and others).\n- The developer test environment was simplified by formally deprecating the old \"KT\" devnet and closing dozens of related acceptance test issues in the [infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra) repository.\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Next-Generation Features**\n_Goal: To begin the development of major new protocol features that will expand the capabilities of the OP Stack and the Superchain._\n- Planning was formally kicked off for integrating ZK (Zero-Knowledge) games, with a suite of new issues created to track work on proof generation, monitoring, and challenging mechanisms in the [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) monorepo.\n- The \"Light Consensus Layer\" initiative was formalized, a feature that will enable more flexible and efficient node configurations. This included adding new flags to `op-node` ([#18270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18270)) and creating a main tracking issue ([#18315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18315)).\n\n**Strengthening the Superchain's Economic Framework**\n_Goal: To enhance the economic sustainability of the Superchain and make it easier for new chains to participate in the ecosystem._\n- New templates were introduced in [superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops) to provide chains with a clear path for upgrading their vaults and opting into the revenue-sharing model ([#1257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1257)).\n- To improve fee market stability, bounds for minimum base fees were added to the standard configurations for mainnet and Sepolia in the [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry) ([#1127](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1127), [#1163](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1163)).\n\n**Bolstering Core Protocol Security and Stability**\n_Goal: To ensure the core protocol remains secure, reliable, and aligned with the broader Ethereum ecosystem._\n- The [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth) client was updated by merging upstream changes from `go-ethereum v1.16.4` ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/689)), ensuring it benefits from the latest L1 developments.\n- The protocol's resilience during network upgrades was improved by adding alternative recovery methods for hardfork activations in [design-docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs) ([#357](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/357)).\n- A correction to the flashblocks specification was merged in [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs), improving protocol accuracy ([#860](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/860)).\n\n**Improving the Developer and Operator Experience**\n_Goal: To make it easier for developers and node operators to build on and interact with the Optimism ecosystem._\n- The [docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs) site underwent a major navigation refactor to improve content discoverability for developers and operators ([#1872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1872)).\n- Key guides for node operators, such as the snap sync documentation, were restructured for better clarity and organization ([#1851](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1851)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\nThis week highlighted strong alignment across teams on strategic priorities:\n\n- **Technical Debt Initiative:** A coordinated effort, visible in `optimism`, `specs`, `design-docs`, `op-analytics`, and `superchain-registry`, involved systematically reviewing old issues and cross-referencing them with the codebase to find and formally track remaining work. This ensures that cleanup from past refactors is fully completed.\n- **Strategic Feature Decisions:** A unified decision was made across multiple repositories to observe the `min-base-fee` feature's performance in production rather than conduct further simulations ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16958)). Additionally, teams aligned on deferring fixes for `op-node`'s EL Sync behavior until the older request/response sync mechanism is fully deprecated, avoiding redundant work.\n- **Upgrade Preparedness:** The core development team (`op-geth`, `superchain-ops`) coordinated with the `docs` team to ensure that critical requirements for upcoming upgrades, such as the `cannonKonaPrestate` ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095)), are clearly documented for operators.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### ethereum-optimism/optimism\n- **Future Features:**

Significant progress was made on long-term initiatives, including a new specification for Custom Gas Tokens and an overhaul of the contract management system. Concurrently, a coordinated, cross-team investigation is underway to diagnose a critical sequencer bug and address emerging performance bottlenecks on Base Mainnet, reinforcing our commitment to a secure and reliable Superchain.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Advancing Future Protocol Capabilities**\n_Goal: To build the next generation of features that will enhance the flexibility, security, and scalability of the OP Stack and Superchain._\n-   **Custom Gas Tokens (CGT):** Foundational work progressed to allow Superchain networks to use tokens other than ETH for transaction fees. A comprehensive specification was introduced in [ethereum-optimism/specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs), while the core implementation advanced significantly in the [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) repository, moving the feature closer to release.\n-   **Next-Generation Proof System:** Strategic planning for the future of the protocol's security continued, with deep architectural discussions on implementing ZK (Zero-Knowledge) proofs. Teams across [ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs) and [ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry) are designing the new system, including how to generate and verify proofs.\n-   **Modernized Contract Management:** A major overhaul of the contract management system, OPCM v2, was advanced in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism). This new architecture will simplify future network upgrades and deployments, making the system more robust and easier to manage.\n\n**Strengthening Protocol Stability and Performance**\n_Goal: To ensure the network remains reliable, secure, and performant for all users and applications._\n-   **Critical Bug Investigation:** A high-priority, cross-team investigation is focused on a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recovery mode that could cause the chain to stall. This effort, tracked across multiple repositories including [ethereum-optimism/specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs) and [ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops), is critical for maintaining protocol stability.\n-   **Addressing Network Performance:** New performance issues on Base Mainnet, including RPC timeouts and batch submission delays, were identified in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism). This has become a new area of focus to ensure the network can handle high demand efficiently.\n-   **Improving Cross-Client Compatibility:** A key milestone was achieved with the successful re-integration of `op-reth` (an alternative client implementation) into the main test suite. This was confirmed across [ethereum-optimism/op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth) and [ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra), strengthening the diversity and resilience of the Superchain ecosystem.\n\n**Enhancing Developer and Operator Experience**\n_Goal: To provide builders with accurate documentation, powerful tools, and clear resources._\n-   **Documentation and Tooling Improvements:** The [ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs) team merged numerous fixes to repair broken links and correct outdated information. In parallel, [ethereum-optimism/op-analytics](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics) introduced a new tool for analyzing fee market dynamics, providing deeper insights for developers.\n-   **Community Contributions:** The project saw valuable engagement from the community, with a new contributor volunteering to fix incorrect Docker image references and add missing environment variable descriptions, improving resources for node operators.\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week highlighted strong collaboration on several key initiatives:\n-   **Sequencer Bug Investigation:** The investigation into the `op-node` sequencer bug ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18350)) is a coordinated effort involving developers from `specs`, `docs`, `superchain-ops`, `optimism`, and `op-analytics`, demonstrating a unified response to a critical stability concern.\n-   **ZK Proof System Design:** Architectural planning for the next-generation ZK proof system is happening in lockstep across `docs`, `optimism`, and `superchain-registry`, ensuring a cohesive strategy for this long-term security upgrade.\n-   **Multi-Client Testing:** The successful integration of `op-reth` into acceptance tests was a shared milestone, with work in `op-geth` and `infra` being validated and confirmed across the `optimism` and `docs` repositories.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### ethereum-optimism/optimism\n-   Advanced the new OP Contracts Manager v2 (OPCM v2) with updated deployment scripts ([#18079](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18079)) and added safety checks to prevent invalid upgrade configurations

This decision was immediately followed by a significant development push to implement the core logic for ZK games. In parallel, the team shipped critical stability fixes for core network components and continued to expand the Superchain with the integration of new chains.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Advancing Protocol Security with ZK Fault Proofs**\n*Strategic Importance: This initiative enhances the security and decentralization of the OP Stack's dispute resolution system, preparing the protocol for the next generation of fraud-proof technology.*\n-   A key strategic decision was made to use the existing `op-challenger` for ZK games, concluding a major research spike and providing a clear path forward for implementation ([`specs`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18322)).\n-   A significant development effort in the `optimism` repository delivered the core logic for ZK game challenges, including architectural refactoring and new functionality for challenging proposals, reclaiming bonds, and resolving games ([#18441](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18441), [#18442](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18442), [#18464](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18464)).\n-   The strategy for ZK proof generation was finalized, with the task assigned to the succinct proposer, closing out a key investigation ([`superchain-registry`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18319)).\n\n**Improving Network Stability and Reliability**\n*Strategic Importance: This work ensures the network remains robust and dependable for all users and node operators, addressing issues that could impact performance and uptime.*\n-   A critical fix was shipped in `optimism` to prevent the sequencer from stalling during network reorganizations, directly improving network uptime ([#18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)).\n-   Bugs in the `op-batcher` were resolved in `optimism` to improve its handling of large block backlogs, enhancing the reliability of data submission to L1 ([#18344](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18344)).\n-   Key stability issues reported by the community, such as `op-node` synchronization problems, are being actively tracked and investigated across multiple repositories, including [`superchain-ops`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18468) and [`infra`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17448), to prioritize future fixes.\n\n**Expanding and Standardizing the Superchain**\n*Strategic Importance: These efforts grow the network of interoperable chains and ensure they are built on a consistent, well-defined foundation, making the ecosystem easier to join and manage.*\n-   The Superchain was expanded with the integration of Base as an executed upgrade and the completion of key setup tasks for Worldchain in `superchain-ops` ([#1312](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1312), [#1284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1284)).\n-   Work progressed on creating a standard `SuperchainDefinition` type within the official `specs`, which will make it easier to configure and manage chains across the ecosystem ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/867)).\n-   Development began in `superchain-registry` to streamline the process of adding new chains by allowing for embedded contract artifacts ([#1172](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1172)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week highlighted strong coordination on several key initiatives that spanned the entire project:\n-   **ZK Challenger Strategy:** The decision to integrate ZK game logic into `op-challenger` was a project-wide effort. The decision was tracked and finalized across issues in `specs`, `ecosystem`, `superchain-ops`, `infra`, `docs`, and `op-geth`, culminating in a focused implementation sprint within the `optimism` repository.\n-   **Superchain Standardization:** The effort to formalize the `SuperchainConfig` type involved collaborative discussion across `specs`, `ecosystem`, `op-geth`, and `infra` to ensure the new specification is clear, language-agnostic, and meets the needs of the growing Superchain.\n-   **Node Stability Monitoring:** Community-reported issues with `op-node` and `proxyd` were tracked and validated across `superchain-ops`, `infra`, `docs`, and `superchain-registry`, creating a unified view of operator pain points that informs development priorities in the core `optimism` repository.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### ethereum-optimism/optimism\n-   **Advanced ZK Challenger:** A major push was made to support ZK games, including refactoring the challenger to be more

["month_2025-12-01", "month", "2025-12-01", "# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nDecember was a month of dual focus, balancing future innovation with present-day stability. We made a significant strategic leap forward by solidifying our approach to ZK fault proofs and completing a large volume of implementation work, while simultaneously dedicating resources to diagnosing and addressing critical node synchronization issues affecting network operators.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Advancing Protocol Security with ZK Fault Proofs**\n_Goal: To enhance the security and versatility of the OP Stack by integrating Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs into our fault-proof system, a key step towards a more robust and decentralized Superchain._\n-   A major strategic decision was made to integrate ZK game challenging directly into the existing `op-challenger`, streamlining development and establishing a clear path forward. This was a key outcome discussed across multiple repositories, including [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs) and [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth).\n-   The core `op-challenger` component was heavily refactored in [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to support ZK games, including the ability to challenge proposals ([#18467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18467)), resolve games ([#18464](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18464)), and reclaim bonds ([#18465](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18465)).\n-   A large volume of planning and implementation issues related to ZK proof generation, configuration, and bond handling were closed across repositories like [superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops), [op-analytics](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics), and [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry), marking the completion of a major feature epic ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18322)).\n\n**Strengthening Network Stability and Reliability**\n_Goal: To ensure the OP Stack is robust and reliable for all node operators and users by actively investigating and resolving critical infrastructure issues._\n-   A high-priority `op-node` synchronization bug affecting operators on Base Mainnet and other chains is under active investigation across the project ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18468), [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18510)), with maintainers and the community collaborating to diagnose the root cause.\n-   A critical bug in the `op-batcher` that could affect transaction processing during periods of high load was fixed in [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) ([#18344](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18344)), improving network resilience.\n-   A potential data consistency risk in `proxyd` that could serve stale block data was identified for a fix in January, demonstrating a proactive approach to infrastructure integrity ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/501)).\n\n**Expanding the Superchain Ecosystem**\n_Goal: To grow a vibrant and interoperable network of chains by integrating new partners and standardizing the configuration process for the Superchain._\n-   The Superchain continued to expand with the official integration of Base as an executed upgrade in [superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops) ([#1312](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1312)).\n-   Progress was made on integrating Worldchain, with key handback tasks completed on the Sepolia testnet ([#1284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1284), [#1315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1315)).\n-   Work began in [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs) to formalize a `SuperchainDefinition` type ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/867)), a crucial step towards creating a more structured and verifiable definition for all chains in the ecosystem.\n\n**Improving the Developer and Operator Experience**\n_Goal: To empower builders by providing comprehensive documentation, streamlined tooling, and reliable infrastructure._\n-   The official documentation received a major overhaul in [docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs), with community guides consolidated ([#1879](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1879)) and widespread formatting and navigation issues fixed ([#1901](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1901), [#1907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1907)).\n-   CI/CD workflows were refactored across [infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra) ([#519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/519)) and [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) ([#18443](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18443)) to improve reliability, security, and maintainability of the development pipeline.\n-   The Custom Gas Token (CGT) system was formally integrated as a system feature in [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) ([#18405](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18405)), removing the developer flag and making it an official part of the OP Stack.\n\n**Supporting Public Goods through RetroPGF**\n_Goal: To foster a sustainable ecosystem by funding projects that provide value to the Optimism Collective and the broader Ethereum community._\n-   Work was completed in [Retro-Funding](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding) to finalize the results for RetroPGF Season 8, Milestone 10, including refining data queries and weightings for onchain builders ([#87](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/87), [#88](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/88)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n-   **ZK Fault Proof Integration:** The month's largest coordinated effort was the push to advance ZK fault proofs. The strategic decision to use `op-challenger` was discussed in [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs) and [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth), with core implementation work in [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), deployment preparations in [superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops), and configuration updates in [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry). This resulted in the closure of a large, cross-repository epic of related issues, demonstrating a unified push on a key technical priority.\n-   **`op-node` Stability Investigation:** The critical `op-node` synchronization issue ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18468)) triggered a project-wide response. The issue was discussed and tracked across nearly every repository, from [infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra) and [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to

`SuperchainDefinition` type to the specification ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/867)).\n-   A key strategic decision was finalized to support ZK game challenging within the existing `op-challenger` ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18322)), providing clarity for future protocol development.\n-   Discussions are underway to enhance testing infrastructure, including a proposal for a new `op-spammer` component ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18482)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry\n-   A large cluster of issues related to ZK proofs and `op-challenger` enhancements was resolved, including support for ZK game types ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18321)) and improved bond handling ([#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18413)-[#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18415)).\n-   The registry was updated to include Kona 1.2.5 prestates ([#1174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1174)), and work began on improving the process for adding new chains ([#1172](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1172)).\n-   Maintainers are actively collaborating with users to debug critical `op-node` synchronization bugs ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18468), [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18510)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/op-analytics\n-   The DEX trades analytics pipeline was enhanced to include Solana data, providing more comprehensive cross-chain analysis ([#1770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1770)).\n-   A critical bug was fixed in the collective revenue calculation process, ensuring accurate financial reporting ([#1772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1772)).\n-   Significant progress was made on the fault-proof system with the closure of numerous issues related to `op-challenger` configuration and ZK proof generation ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18321), [#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18319)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding\n-   Work was completed to finalize the results for RetroPGF Season 8, Milestone 10, including several refinements to the weights for onchain builders ([#87](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/87), [#88](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/88)).\n-   Discussions progressed on improving developer tooling with a proposal to create a new `op-spammer` component to help find bugs on devnets ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18482)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/ecosystem\n-   A significant refactoring effort began to unify CI workflows and replace individual Docker build files with a single, streamlined process, aiming to simplify maintenance ([#971](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/971)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/op-geth\n-   New work was initiated to advance protocol updates ([#730](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/730)) and improve the robustness of Jovian precompiles by adding new tests ([#731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/731)).\n-   Active discussions continued on critical infrastructure topics, including the `op-node` synchronization failure ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18510)) and the porting
