Significant effort was dedicated to improving how the dispute monitoring service handles out-of-sync nodes, a critical step in ensuring the integrity of the Superchain and preventing false alarms.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening Protocol Security and Reliability**\n*This initiative is vital for maintaining the integrity of the OP Stack, ensuring that the dispute resolution process\u2014a cornerstone of optimistic rollups\u2014functions correctly under all network conditions.*\n-   A critical discussion was initiated to make the dispute monitoring system smarter, preventing it from raising false alarms when network nodes are temporarily lagging in synchronization ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).\n-   Work began on improving how nodes synchronize data across the network, making the entire system more resilient and data-consistent ([ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism)).\n-   Progress was made to tighten security filters in the infrastructure's validation components, further hardening the system against potential issues ([ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n**Diagnosing and Solving a Core Security Challenge**\n-   Teams from both the core protocol and infrastructure repositories collaborated on a critical issue to define a robust solution for the dispute monitoring system. This joint effort ensures that a key security component of the OP Stack behaves correctly when encountering nodes with synchronization delays, preventing incorrect dispute resolutions and bolstering trust in the network.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### ethereum-optimism/optimism\n-   Opened a significant new issue ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814)) to address how `op-dispute-mon` handles out-of-sync rollup RPCs, sparking a key discussion on improving the system's reliability.\n-   Proposed adding ELSync gap filling to `op-node` ([#17751](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17751)) to improve data synchronization resilience.\n-   Enhanced the stability of the dispute monitor by better handling \"not found\" scenarios ([#17825](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17825)).\n-   Updated the Optimism Contract Management (`opcm`) tool to support V2 contracts ([#17782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17782)), ensuring compatibility with the latest protocol upgrades.\n-   Streamlined the `opcm` codebase by removing an unused variable ([#17828](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17828)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/infra\n-   Initiated work to introduce stricter exclusion gates within the `op-acceptor` ([#490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/490)), aiming to improve the component's filtering capabilities and security.\n-   Participated in a key technical discussion on issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814) to find a robust solution for the `op-dispute-mon`'s behavior with out-of-sync nodes, highlighting a proactive focus on infrastructure reliability.", "2025-10-18T23:29:21.990Z"]

`ethereum-optimism/op-geth` ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/773)), `ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry` ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/773)), `ethereum-optimism/specs` ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/773)), `ethereum-optimism/op-analytics` ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/773)), `ethereum-optimism/docs` ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/773)), and `ethereum-optimism/optimism` ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/773)).\n*   `MinBaseFee` was added to `L2InitializationConfig` in `op-chain-ops/genesis` to allow configuration at genesis in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` ([#17862](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17862)).\n*   `op-program` now has passing action tests for Jovian in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` ([#17302](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17302)).\n\n### Infrastructure & Tooling Refinements\n*   The `c-kzg-4844` library was updated to version 2.1.5 in `ethereum-optimism/op-geth` ([#702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/702)).\n*   `op-supernode` was integrated into scheduled Docker publishing and cross-platform builds in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` ([#17970](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17970)).\n*   CI parallelism for `go-tests` jobs was reduced in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` ([#17988](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17988), [#17974](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17974)).\n*   A critical fix was implemented to ensure the daily-codegen job properly triggers on CircleCI, and a new daily-codegen job was added to automatically run codegen and create a pull request if diffs are detected in `ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry` ([#1123](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1123), [#1120](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1120), [#1124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1124)).\n*   The `worldchain-sepolia` configuration was updated with its Isthmus activation timestamp in `ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry` ([#1119](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1119), [#1124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1124)).\n\n### Documentation & Developer Experience\n*   New specifications were created for `L1BlockNumber` predeploy, `AddressManager`, and `LegacyMessagePasser` in `ethereum-optimism/specs` ([#811](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/811), [#809](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/809), [#806](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/806)).\n*   The `FeeVault` specification was unified to cover all fee vault types, including `OperatorFeeVault` in `ethereum-optimism/specs` ([#810](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/810), [#808](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/808), [#807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/807)).\n*   The `create-l2-rollup` example was enhanced to fund developer accounts in `ethereum-optimism/docs` ([#1803](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1803)).\n*   A fix was implemented for `rollup.sequencerhttp` in the `create-l2-rollup-example` in `ethereum-optimism/docs` ([#1804](https://github.optimism/docs/pull/1804)).\n*   AI engineering prompts were refactored to include explicit commit strategies and improve test quality guidance in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` ([#17950](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17950)).\n*   Instructions for manually triggering the `op-batcher` to post data to the DA layer were added in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` ([#17967](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17967)).\n*   Direct Engine API support for `op-reth` was implemented within `op-devstack` in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` ([#17964](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17964)).\n\n### Dispute Game & Contract Security\n*   `OPContractsManager_UpdatePrestate_Test` was updated to correctly set up `disputegame-v2` parameters in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` ([#17956](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17956)).\n*   A potential reentrancy vector in `LivenessModule2` was addressed and natspec in `SaferSafes` was updated in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` ([#17975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17975), [#17976](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17976)).\n*   The issue of using v2 dispute game contracts in `OPCM.updatePrestate` was resolved and feature-flagged in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` ([#17261](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17261)).\n*   Migration of Super DG to the creator pattern was completed in `ethereum-optimism/optimism` ([#17972](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17972)).\n\n### Validation Process Streamlining\n*   Issues related to validating all chains on PRs and not running genesis validation checks for frontier chains were closed across `ethereum-optimism/infra` ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/689), [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/696)), `ethereum-optimism/op-geth` ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/689), [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/696)), `ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry` ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/689), [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/696)), `ethereum-optimism/specs` ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/689), [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/696)), `ethereum-optimism/op-analytics` ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/689), [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/696)), `ethereum-optimism/docs` ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/689), [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/696)), and `ethereum-optimism/optimism` ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/689), [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/696)).\n\n## \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Work in Progress\n### New Pull
