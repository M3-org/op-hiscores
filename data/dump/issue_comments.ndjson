These contracts are large (~24kb, right at the size limit), therefore they cost 3-5M gas to deploy. Say it's 4M gas, this means to update prestates we can only update the prestate for 3 chains in one transaction (30M gas limit / 4M gas per game / 2 games per chain = 3.75).

Devs asked if they need to, \"need to specify price/basefee/priority fee? or just send and pray?\"\r\n- A: One reason we went with \u2018\u2019\u2019estimateFees\u2019\u2019\u2019 is because it's an action that will exist on non op chains. On ethereum estimateFees would just do \u2018\u2019\u2019gasPrice * gasUsed\u2019\u2019\u2019 whille on OP chains it's \u2018\u2019\u2019gasPrice * gasUsed + L1GasFee\u2019\u2019\u2019 but from developer/user point of view they don't have to think about that they just call \u2018\u2019\u2019viemClient.estimateFees()\u2019\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\n- Q: wouldn\u2019t devs likely send their transaction directly with an \u2018\u2019\u2019eth_sendRawTransaction\u2019\u2019\u2019? Likely abstracted away with a library like viem? \r\n- A: the sending transaction directly flow works! the libraries just give you an L1 estimate as well, which is automagically handled in the direct flow, but you're deducted more than the estimateGas endpoint since that only accounts for the L2 portion", "2023-11-23T01:11:45Z", "2023-11-23T01:20:30Z", "cpengilly", "2025-08-30 07:16:31"]

When no batches are detected in the inbox after this, it starts deterministically creating L2 blocks from the L1 data without batches, so that users can still move funds without sequencer co-operation. Here it looks like it ended up missing valid batches for some reason, and then got out of sync because of that.\r\n\r\nGetting into this situation likely means there is (or was) something misconfigured. You can check the `optimism_rollupConfig` JSON-RPC of the op-node RPC endpoint (not op-geth!) and the CLI options, and compare against the docs. That should tell you if something is off.\r\n", "2024-01-05T01:02:47Z", "2024-01-05T01:02:47Z", "protolambda", "2025-08-30 07:16:53"]

Luckily the new Path-DB format is fixing this DB corruption issue, and we will be adopting these improvements from upstream geth as soon as we can.\r\n\r\n@protolambda Could you please help me with some questions. I got the same issue from the author due to a power cut.\r\n\r\nAt step 2. I got this result. What number should I use to put in step 4 ?\r\n\r\n```\r\nsimple-optimism-node-op-geth-1  | INFO [10-04|21:27:54.903] Maximum peer count                       ETH=50 LES=0

We \"need\" this information to perform checks on it in `CheckSecurityConfigs.s.sol`. But, those checks are actually just reading the information from the chain in the same way. We know that they will pass, unless the output of the script is tampered with or the on chain information changes between running the `add-chain.sh` script and running the test. Is the point of those particular checks in `CheckSecurityConfigs.s.sol` to ensure the newly added addresses are \"statically queryable\" by consumers of the registry (they don't need to make network requests)?\r\n\r\n2. I think we have a goal to only ask contributors to give us minimal information in general, and generate extra data from that minimal data. See https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/security-pod/issues/74, https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/security-pod/issues/75. Putting network calls into `add-chain.sh` seems to be driving in the opposite direction to our goal. But perhaps we need to accept that in the short term and revisit it as part of the longer term refactoring of the repo?\r\n\r\n3. We should also consider updating this list of addresses parsed and exported by the Go module:\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/4a8560435b4a38dffbf5cc30b6b15eeaae002b1e/superchain/superchain.go#L105-L117", "2024-04-02T19:30:02Z", "2024-04-02T19:30:02Z", "geoknee", "2025-08-30 10:54:42"]

Yea my understanding is those checks ensure validity and consistency of al the data provided, because of the fact that chains don't currently provide a \"minimal set of data\" with us auto-generating the rest into output files.\r\n2. I believe you are saying \"putting network calls into `add-chain.sh` takes us in the opposite direction of requiring minimal data, because it results in more data being committed by the contributor\"? If so, I'd argue we already have a fixed set of required input data for contributors, and new network calls in `add-chain.sh` doesn't expand that, and just makes it easier for contributors to automatically fetch data that's currently missing by default (ProxyAdminOwner / SystemConfigOwner / Guardian / Challenger addresses). But to your point, longer term it may be better to have a clear `input` and `output` split where contributors PR a minimal set of data into `input` and we autogenerate everything needed in output, and run checks against that output data. \r\n3.

["IC_kwDOKIsnqM57tKPU", "I_kwDOKIsnqM6F3SOR", "The Forge Proposal Simulator is designed to help eliminate bugs in governance proposals. It does this in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Explicitly ask the developer to write validations tailored to each proposal, which adds safety checks and lets you know the actions that were run made the expected state changes.\r\n2. Allows you to wire together the governance proposals into the integration tests. Let's say optimism has a huge integration test suite just for the smart contracts in another repo, which I would imagine to be the case. With a little bit of work connecting this framework to your integration tests, now all governance proposals will run against your integration test suite. Say there is a bug caused by a change in a governance proposal where some part of the smart contract system on L1, or L2 will not work after the proposal passes. If an integration test existed for that behavior, you would be able to catch this bug in the governance proposal before it goes live.\r\n\r\nTo properly integrate this tool and get the full benefits, you would likely need to move your governance proposal creation to the repo where the smart contracts and integration test suite lives, but I'm sure there's other ways around this if you don't want to move things around too much.\r\n\r\nIn most smart contract protocols today, governance proposals and deployment scripts are some of the least audited parts of the codebase because they are expected to be secure, or not do anything incorrectly. These assumptions often turn out to be wrong, so we built this tool to help solve this pain point and hopefully get rid of bugs that could be easily caught with checks and a run against the existing integration test suite post proposal.\r\n\r\nThe main benefit you would get from day 1 using this tool is there would not be a need to write a [JSON](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/blob/main/tasks/sep/metal-001-MCP-L1/input.json) file that specifies all targets, calls, parameters, and values. Instead, you could write the proposal straight in readable Solidity, which would then be extracted into calls for the multisig wallet to make via multicall. This is what a proposal would look like from an example in our docs: \r\n<img width=\"776\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-24 at 10 00 03\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/assets/34463580/3a1d6845-a52b-4d3e-89a3-88d2911ebb51\">\r\nYou just write the proposal in plain solidity, and then the tool extracts the calldata, pranks as the multisig, and applies the state changes. It includes support for Gnosis Safes, Openzeppelin Timelock Controllers and Governor Bravo/Timelock DAO combinations. Once you've generated a multisig proposal, and run everything locally, all tests and validations pass, it provides a convenient calldata logging functionality, which you can then take, and paste straight into the Gnosis Safe UI.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about Forge Proposal Simulator in the [docs](https://docs.soliditylabs.io/forge-proposal-simulator), [reading the code](https://github.com/solidity-labs-io/forge-proposal-simulator/tree/main), or reach out directly and I can walk you through things.", "2024-04-24T17:05:59Z", "2024-04-24T17:05:59Z", "ElliotFriedman", "2025-08-30 12:01:02"]

We'll likely make some improvements here based on your suggestions to improve readability and make this path more FV friendly \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nThis issue would prevent the game from resolving, locking all bonds up within the game above the subgame that's bricked. However, it would not cause the game to resolve incorrectly - it would effectively be bricked due to all sub-games not being resolved.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this is low-medium in severity, and the attack is costly for the malicious party:\r\n* If the game proposes a correct output and the game gets bricked, anyone can come along and just create a new output proposal, which costs on average $10-15. The one with the 6k+ subgames on a node won't finalize, but that's no problem - withdrawers could re-prove their withdrawal against a future game's output root. To sustain the DoS, the attacker would need to get 1 claim w/ 6k+ subgames in each dispute game that is active.\r\n* If the game proposes an incorrect output, the game can never finalize anyways since all subgames of the root can't be resolved. There's no incentive for a malicious actor to perform this attack on a game with a malicious root claim.\r\n\r\nBonds are not currently defined in the `getRequiredBond` function, but early work on them suggests that they will be fairly high to cover the costs of hardware and to maintain a high probability of collateralization between the time of creation and a possible counter. Let's say they're `2 ETH` per interaction - not including execution or native transaction costs associated with the creation of the 6,000 subgames, it would cost the attacker `$28,092,120 USD` to create the 6,000 subgames in that single dispute game alone at today's spot ETH price. The honest actors would still be able to counter and take the bonds of these 6,000 subgames, unless the counters themselves had 6,000 more responses, since credit is accumulated as each subgame is resolved + subgames are resolved bottom-up.

We definitely want to enable interactions with untrusted contracts as much as possible. I am trying to wrap my head around how different the security model would be in practice if we had some sort of additional unique identifier within the message that would enable the events to be distinguished because an untrusted contract could still just emit the same event at the wrong place.\r\n\r\nFor example, emitting a `Burn` event that can be used to `Mint` on a remote chain, how do we know that its actually subtracting from the users balance? This leads me to believe there is some fundamental amount of distrust that you need to have when interacting with contracts on remote chains, which is not much different than interacting with untrusted contracts on a local chain.", "2024-05-27T19:45:50Z", "2024-05-27T19:45:50Z", "tynes", "2025-08-30 14:12:46"]

["IC_kwDOLB-lzc6AMdGU", "I_kwDOLB-lzc6KEHUJ", "Initiating Messages are Events. You would call an executing message on the destination chain with an `Identifier` pointing to the Event or log in the source chain.\r\n\r\nPlease correct me if I did not understand the attack, I have been going through the spec as well. It would work in this way:\r\n\r\nAssume Chain B has Chain A in the dependency set, and Chain A has Chain B in the dependency set. Assume these chains trust each other, and consider pre-confirmations to be safe, allowing sub-second interop among both chains with minimal latency.\r\n\r\n1. On block X on chain A, there is an NFT collection that lets you mint another NFT if you already have the NFT.\r\n```\r\nfunction mint() public payable {\r\n    if (IERC721(collectionAddress).balanceOf(msg.sender) > 0) {\r\n        // User owns an NFT in collection C\r\n        _mintNFT(msg.sender);\r\n    } else if (msg.value >= 10 ether) {\r\n        // User pays 10 ETH\r\n        _mintNFT(msg.sender);\r\n    } else {\r\n        // Revert transaction with error\r\n        revert(\"Must hold NFT from collection C or pay 10 ETH\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. On block X + 1, Alice mints an NFT sends the NFT to their wallet on Chain B. They send a \"transferNFT\" transaction on Chain A, that locks the NFT in the contract, and emits an event `TransferNFT`.\r\n```\r\nfunction transferNFT(address to, uint256 tokenId) public {\r\n    // Ensure the caller is the owner of the NFT\r\n    require(ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, \"Caller is not the owner\");\r\n\r\n    // Transfer the NFT\r\n    _transfer(msg.sender, to, tokenId);\r\n\r\n    // Emit the TransferNFT event\r\n    emit TransferNFT(msg.sender, to, tokenId);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n 3. Now we can call the [CrossL2Inbox](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/predeploys.html#crossl2inbox) with the [Identifier](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/messaging.html#message-identifier), and specify a target address on Chain B, that will create some sort of wrapped or bridged NFT with the same token ID and send it to Alice's wallet on Chain B. It emits an event `MintBridgedNFT ` on block X + 1. \r\n ```\r\n // Define the BridgedNFT contract\r\ncontract BridgedNFT is ERC721 {\r\n\r\n    // Define the MintBridgedNFT event\r\n    event MintBridgedNFT(address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId);\r\n\r\n    // Function to mint bridged NFT\r\n    function mintBridgedNFT(address to, uint256 tokenId) public {\r\n        // Mint the bridged NFT\r\n        _safeMint(to, tokenId);\r\n        // Emit the MintBridgedNFT event\r\n        emit MintBridgedNFT(to, tokenId);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure I am seeing how we could use `MintBridgedNFT` emitted on Chain B to mint more free NFTs on Chain A. Could you clarify?\r\n\r\nAlso, [cyclic dependencies](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/messaging.html#cyclic-dependencies) are expected as Chain A must be able to communicate with Chain B and vice versa all the time, and should be possible to resolve if we look at them as a directed graph with vertices as blocks and edges as dependencies.\r\n", "2024-06-05T18:56:13Z", "2024-06-05T18:57:04Z", "SkandaBhat", "2025-08-30 14:15:03"]

Otherwise the initiating message can be after the executing message, and break core assumptions.\r\n\r\nIntra-block messaging is an active area of research, and can be trivially disabled by tweaking the timestamp invariant in the smart-contract. Still, this is a good feature, so we are looking for ways to enforce the intra-block ordering elegantly.\r\n\r\nThe not-so-elegant solution would be to enforce a total ordering by event-log index, but when you consider cross-L2 intra-block messaging, this creates an undesired amount of incompatible cross-L2 messages. Ideally we use some form of relative ordering, to allow messages to interact with eachother, while keeping all dependencies in a form of a DAG (i.e. no cycles between messages, but possible still back and forth interactions between two blocks).\r\n\r\nNote that this ordering can be enforced outside of the EVM; just like the dependency correctness is validated by the verifier, the ordering can also be checked.\r\n \r\n", "2024-06-05T19:12:22Z", "2024-06-05T19:12:22Z", "protolambda", "2025-08-30 14:15:03"]

Let me take the liberty to say, is there really a team maintaining this chain?\r\n\r\nIt moves forward for me using an external beacon service, so something is off about the way these beacon endpoints are configured and the docs seem incomplete about how to configure and enable the needed data. I tried prysm without pruning, ie synced from genesis and no pruning flags enabled but no dice. So I tried lighthouse using checkpoint sync and turning prune-blobs to false, and enabing genesis-backfill. It does not seem that it backfills the blobs, however. I'm now trying lighthouse to sync from genesis with the same flags, we'll see if it works in a while. You can test your beacon endpoint like this:\r\n`curl http://192.168.0.17:55702/eth/v1/beacon/blob_sidecars/5335452`\r\n\r\nto test the blob sidecars, change the block num to what the logs say in the derivation error to see if your beacon endpoint has it. @alexqrid your error seems to indicate you're using checkpoint sync with no backfill if I was to guess, not even about the blob sidecars. `t=2024-04-23T16:36:37+0000 lvl=warn msg=\"Derivation process temporary error\" attempts=8595 err=\"stage 0 failed resetting: temp: failed to find the L2 Heads to start from: failed to fetch current L2 forkchoice state: failed to find the finalized L2 block: failed to parse L1 info deposit tx from L2 block: data is unexpected length: 260\"`\r\n\r\n@Rogalek you need to look earlier in your logs for an error like `Derivation process temporary error` to see what its saying, it may after a certain point stop showing that and just sync optimistically for a while, at least so I've found, especially if I change from consensus-layer sync to execution-layer sync, it'll just optimistically queue payloads blocks forever and never update geth head", "2024-04-23T17:11:18Z", "2024-04-23T17:11:18Z", "icculp", "2025-08-30 15:20:28"]

["IC_kwDODjvEJM5lrxW2", "I_kwDODjvEJM5skolw", "> I'm trying to run [this bundler](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/bundler) together with local devnet, but have no luck.\r\n> \r\n> I first add `--rpc.allow-unprotected-txs` flag to both entrypoint.sh files in ops-bedrock folder, since without it I get \"only replay-protected (EIP-155) transactions allowed over RPC\" error later. Then I launch the devnet using `make devnet-up` and make some adjustments in the bundler code: change all relevant target ports from 8545 to 9545 and in the 2-deploy-entrypoint.ts file comment out the code that checks that `chainId` is either 1337 or 31337, since it is actually 901.\r\n> \r\n> But when I run `yarn hardhat-deploy --network localhost` to deploy the entrypoint, I get \"Insufficient funds\" error.\r\n> \r\n> I think I need to change some private key-related settings of the devnet, but I'm not sure which ones.

It works fine without any adjustments, but since I'm developing for Optimism it's not what I ultimately need.\r\n\r\nHi @rho-cassiopeiae this bundler run smoothly in my fresh Ubuntu 22.04, Make sure you start the devnet correctly. I recommend install geth by `make install-geth` in the optimism mono. \r\n\r\nSuccessful Launch: After following these steps, I successfully ran the bundler on port 3000 and made sure it was bound to port 9545.\r\n\r\n1. **Removed ChainID Validation:** To adapt to a specific network setting, I removed the ChainID validation located in the `./bundler/packages/bundler/deploy/2-deploy-entrypoint.ts`.\r\n\r\n2. **Port Adjustment:** I changed the port number to 9545 in both` ./bundler/packages/bundler/hardhat.config.ts` and `./bundler/packages/bundler/localconfig/bundler.config.json`.\r\n \r\n3. **Shell Script Update:** I revised the `./optimism/ops-bedrock/entrypoint-l2.sh` script to accommodate the [new configurations and environment variables](https://gist.github.com/joohhnnn/dd45f7ab3e1d006c063e705fb540e6ed). \r\n\r\n4. **Funds deploymentSignerAddress:** Using port 9545, I sent 1 ETH to the address 0x3fab184622dc19b6109349b94811493bf2a45362.\r\n\r\n**I also find the process pretty cumbersome.

Some OP stack users are using viem. Some ethersv6. Most ethers v5. \r\n\r\nOur strategy is to keep the sdk for ethersv5 users but work towards getting all functionality into the core libraries via extensions and decorators and I am chatting with all 3 major libraries to drive this effort. After this is done the sdk won't be necessary as these libraries will support OP functionality batteries included. Since our time is limited this unfortunately means neglecting old patterns like the sdk for the time being. \r\n- Ethers v6 has just started adding their version of this via their ethersv6 plugin pattern\r\n- @spacesailor24 is driving web3.js support\r\n- I'm working on adding our viem decorators\r\n\r\nAs for your issue, the error messages look related to hardhat and unrelated to this issue?

The legibility of the validation checks (answering the question _how do we define the standard config_?) \r\n\r\nEverything else can be an implementation detail and fit whatever format is easiest to maintain for Eng, but these two things should be stupid-easy to find and understand, even for someone who hasn't spent much time within the repo.\r\n\r\nFor (1), I think that `superchain/configs/chainList.json` is not easy enough to find today. I'd like to see that file as a top-level file, or maybe under `superchain` directly. If there are technical reasons why this isn't possible, we could put a link at the top of the readme or have some other kind of signpost, but I'd rather just have it front and center. I don't imagine that it will be obvious to look in `configs` for the list of members of the Superchain. \r\n\r\nFor (2), I think your proposal is pretty much as legible as it gets! So this looks great to me. I _do_ want to just double check that we're good with governance ratifying a toml file rather than an executable set of tests -- I'll check this over Slack and keep you in the loop.", "2024-06-20T13:28:23Z", "2024-06-20T13:28:23Z", "tessr", "2025-08-30 17:30:29"]

I don't think this makes a difference to the genesis block hash validation check.\n\nFor Superlumio, it looks like you have hardfork times \"missing\". In the registry we allow chains to override superchain-wide hardfork times, but not with nil values. So by not specifying overrides for e.g. ecotone_time, the chain is inheriting the superchain-wide hardfork times (and a bunch of other values that are pinned to that hardfork time) when we reconstruct the genesis, and this affects the genesis block hash which we compute in the check.\n\nOn a local branch I hacked around with this by deactivating the hardfork times for the entire supechain, then the checks for these chains pass.\n\nI can see two possible resolutions:\n* ~We have to ensure canyon, delta and ecotone are activated on these chains and update the hardfork times as appropriate in the .yaml files to non-nil values.~ this isn't really an option, they would need to be activated at genesis.\n* We could change the registry behaviour to allow overriding from non-nil to nil.

Are you expecting the methods you mentioned (e.g. `getPendingTxs()` and `cancelSend(nonce)`) to be accessible, after abstraction layers, through (a) cli commands, (b) json rpc requests, or (c) a different way? \r\n    * Edit: Seems like we probably want to add `admin_*` methods to the json rpc server on the `op-proposer`, `op-challenger`. Those two services already have `admin` api namespaces. Should we also add an `admin` api to the `op-node` and add the same methods?

Chain A's portal needs to know the addresses of chain B and C's portals. (More generally it just needs some way to discover them, e.g. storing system config addresses and looking up the portal's address, or a dependency set registry, etc).\r\n- Now when a portal processes a withdrawal, if it has insufficient ETH, it loops through addresses of portals B and C to see if they have sufficient ETH, and if so calls an auth'd function that lets it withdraw the required amount of ETH.\r\n\r\nConsiderations:\r\n- Maybe naive looping is too insufficient to scale and we need to be smarter about how we find the portal(s) to pull ETH from.\r\n- The invariant we want to hold here is that all withdrawals can be processed, assuming aggregate solvency across all bridges.

I think there are the following two approaches to genesis validation:\r\n\r\n## \"compile & ignore immutables\"\r\nThis is exactly as you describe in your steps 1-5. I think you are correct that an invocationCommand is not required for this approach (although, we still ideally would have the necessary commands to install dependencies and compile, in case `pnpm install && forge build` does not work for older commits). We also do not need the `deploy-config.json` for this approach.\r\n\r\nThis is the initial approach we are taking on #475 .\r\n\r\nThe downsides are: we ignore immutable variables and have to inspect account balances, maintain the list of standard predeploys and storage variables in a more ad hoc fashion too.\r\n\r\n## regenerate genesis exactly\r\nThis is the gold standard approach. To enumerate the steps, it is the same as above with the following modifications:\r\n3. Run `forge build` followed by the genesis creation tool (i.e. using the `invocationCommand`, which will consume `deploy-config.json`)\r\n4/5: Compare the output of the genesis creation tool with what is on chain (or equivalently, stored in the registry). \r\n\r\nThe downsides of this are we need more input from the user to regenerate the genesis, but the upsides are that we get an exact description of the output that is acceptable. \r\n\r\n\r\nI think what we ought to do in the short term is enable the first approach and leave the door open to upgrading the second approach in the future. Since we are trying to make this whole genesis validation approach a \"first class citizen\" by modifying the genesis creation tooling itself, it seems right to shoot for the gold standard (its much cleaner given the fact we can ensure repeatability of the genesis creation). \r\n\r\nPerhaps the `invocationCommand` field can be left null while we are on the first validation approach.

We don't want to expose setters that the chain operator can change, but we do want the `initialize` on the `SystemConfig` to trigger deposit transactions that set network specific values in the `L1Block` contract.\r\n\r\nEach predeploy that has network specific configuration (for example, the `L1CrossDomainMessenger.otherMessenger`) should be updated to read the value from a call to the `L1Block` contract rather than read from storage.\r\n\r\nWhen the `SystemConfig` is initialized the first time, it will trigger a bunch of deposit transactions (should be the first deposits that the network accepts, like \"bootloader transactions\") and these pass the network specific configuration into the L2.

The fault proof program can be given proofs to each subsequent log and ensure that the nonces increment by one each time.\r\n\r\nThe definition of a `TransactionDeposited` event is as follows:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nevent TransactionDeposited(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed version, bytes opaqueData);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `version` field can be used to determine the encoding of the `opaqueData`. The v0 definition of `opaqueData` is:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nbytes memory opaqueData = abi.encodePacked(_mint, _value, _gasLimit, _isCreation, _data);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor v1, we can add a nonce to `opaqueData` like so:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nbytes memory opaqueData = abi.encodePacked(nonce, _mint, _value, _gasLimit, _isCreation, _data);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `nonce` would be incremented after each deposit transaction and held in storage in the `OptimismPortal`.\r\n\r\nLets say that there were 3 deposits in block 10 with the nonces 5, 6 and 7. To guarantee that we observed all of the deposits in block 10, we would need proofs for deposits with nonces 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. We would observe that 5-7 are in block 10 and 4 and 8 are not in block 10. If we used a more complicated data structure on chain, it would be possible to relax needing to observe the boundaries. We would need to be careful with edge cases around 0. Note that this can be added to the system without any need for the fault proof programs to instantly upgrade to and adopt, they can adopt it at any time.\r\n\r\nIn the derivation pipeline, we would need to update the parsing of the data [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/fb2530c4e2bee39a050edf969dec522317e5ba64/op-node/rollup/derive/deposit_log.go#L87) but we could ignore the nonce. It is only useful in the fault proof program, to guarantee that we have observed all deposits.\r\n\r\nA nice property to observe would be to have a nonce in the `L1Block` contract that accumulates the number of deposits. This would essentially give the ability to look at the nonce on L1 in the `OptimismPortal` and know how many deposits are waiting to be pulled into L2. This can be useful for applications that depend on censorship resistance or to learn the size of the deposit queue, as specified in https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/82. The only way to do this in a backwards compatible way would be to introduce the logic for parsing v1 `opaqueData` in the `op-node` before upgrading the `OptimismPortal` on L1. The `op-node` would need to include a \"number of deposits\" parameter in the L1 attributes transaction. This parameter would only increment for v1 deposits, so until the `OptimismPortal` is updated to use `TransactionDeposited` v1, the \"number of deposits\" parameter would always be 0.", "2024-08-24T23:15:53Z", "2024-08-24T23:15:53Z", "tynes", "2025-08-30 20:53:13"]

This means that during derivation, L2 history is able to be accessed arbitrarily. State is a bit trickier to access arbitrarily without archival state access. This proposal involved moving the L1 attributes data to storage by putting it into L2 state and deduplicating the data from being posted over and over again in each L1 attributes transaction.\r\n\r\nThis can be considered an optimization in the future. Perhaps the model that we want is in each epoch (where sequencer number is 0) we emit an event that includes the most recent L1 attributes data and then store the rest into storage.

And then you have the `is_law_of_chains` fields, which just becomes a an OP-specific superset of the base fields.\r\n* Not sure how I feel about the `has_mods` column. While potentially useful, this may be a subjective measure or what all qualifies as a modification.\r\n* In op-analytics Repo [chain_metadata](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/blob/main/op_chains_tracking/inputs/chain_metadata.csv), there is a column named `raas_deployer`, but in Dune Upload from OP Labs CRM [dataset_op_stack_chain_metadata](https://dune.com/queries/3109219), there is a column named `initial_chain_deployer`. I would much prefer using `initial_chain_deployer` as there will never be null fields. Maybe there should also be a `current_chain_deployer` field in case someone change deployers?\r\n* Dune Upload from OP Labs CRM [dataset_op_stack_chain_metadata](https://dune.com/queries/3109219) has several columns named for individual contracts. To generalize this, I would support having a single field named `contracts` (or similar), then use json/yml to nest the names of the contracts and their addresses.

You likely could determine some of this from onchain bytecode when a new chain gets deployed, but if there's any changes in their deployment, that wouldn't work anymore.\r\n\r\nGiven that it seems like potentially dynamic metadata is wanted to be included (which I agree with), I'm not sure that any of this needs to be onchain. Unless of course there's already a need for this that I'm not aware of.\r\n\r\nFor an OP Stack specific registry, unfortunately I think you or someone else at OP Labs will have to be the approver/denier. A more open solution would be great, but would likely lead to the list getting spammed with bad data.\r\n\r\nWhile the ideal outcome is of course that projects always want to add themselves to the list, they may not care or know about the list. Of course make it as known as possible, but then maybe also tie in eligibility of going on the Superchain Eco website to first adding their data to this registry.

Breaking the withdrawal API is a big pain in the neck and something we should avoid if possible. Otherwise this will likely be delayed until something else needs to break the API and I'm not sure what that would be...\r\n\r\nYeah, we should be able to manage this for the critical path (`proveWithdrawalTransaction` + `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` + events)\r\n\r\nAs for the administrative functions (`setRespectedGameType` + `blacklistDisputeGame`) & state vars (`respectedGameType`, `disputeGameBlacklist`, `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt`), what do you think about these? These should not be consumed by anyone else, except for maybe `viem`. It would be very nice to move these to a different location (without a fall-through, so that people like succinct don't need to have dead code in their bridge.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf I could wave a magic wand here, what I'd like to do (roughly) is:\r\n1. Create a new interface, `IProofSystem`. This would have:\r\n    * A view function for fetching an output proposal by index.\r\n    * A view function for checking a withdrawal's validity. Things like timestamps, etc. should be passed in. It would be on the portal to pass in honest values. It should not need to call-back to reference external state.\r\n    * For other, lower-level concerns (i.e. the blacklist, respected type, etc.), these can be hidden underneath the interface's function impls.\r\n2. Remove DG-specific functions and state vars from the `OptimismPortal2`.\r\n3. Add in the `IProofSubmitter` to the portal, re-using the slot that the `DisputeGameFactory` is currently stored in.\r\n4. Add gaps to the `respectedGameType`, `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt`, and `disputeGameBlacklist` slots.\r\n5. Retain the other ABI verbatim (`proveWithdrawalTransaction` + `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction`, events, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Usage Analysis\r\n\r\n* `setRespectedGameType`\r\n    * 0 use in `viem`\r\n    * 0 use in `op-challenger`\r\n    * 1 usage in `DeputyGuardianModule`\r\n* `blacklistDisputeGame`\r\n    * 0 use in `viem` \r\n    * 0 use in `op-challenger`\r\n    * 1 usage in `DeputyGuardianModule`\r\n* `respectedGameType`\r\n    * 1 usage in `viem` [here](https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/9d7d1602aa103f9db15f2b696944430c8ef643f7/src/op-stack/actions/getGames.ts#L102-L106)\r\n    * 0 use in `op-challenger`\r\n    * 0 use in `DeputyGuardianModule`\r\n* `disputeGameBlacklist`\r\n    * 0 use in `op-challenger`\r\n    * 0 use in `DeputyGuardianModule`\r\n    * 0 use in `viem`\r\n* `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt`\r\n    * 0 use in `op-challenger`\r\n    * 0 use in `DeputyGuardianModule`\r\n    * 0 use in `viem` \r\n* `checkWithdrawal`\r\n    * 0 use in `op-challenger`\r\n    * 0 use in `DeputyGuardianModule`\r\n    * 1 usage in `viem` [here](https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/main/src/op-stack/actions/getWithdrawalStatus.ts#L221-L226)\r\n\r\nWith this, breaking the API would not be so painful, it doesn't look like. It would also remove periphery codepaths from our most important contract, which is always good. However on the front of breaking the core withdrawal path API, we should not do that imo.\r\n\r\nMonitoring is another concern here though. What would definitely change my opinion here is if these changes complicated or added risk to our monitoring path, cc @ajsutton.", "2024-09-27T23:31:36Z", "2024-09-27T23:35:43Z", "clabby", "2025-08-30 21:56:13"]
["IC_kwDOLB-lzc6N9FtC", "I_kwDOLB-lzc6VZjZf", "Yeah agreed the key priority is maintaining compatibility with the withdrawal flow. Moving things like `respectedGameType`, `disputeGameBlacklist` and `respectedGameTypeUpatedAt` is likely to break some integrations like ENS but I feel like they're digging into a lot of implementation details in a way that isn't particularly ideal for them now anyway. They really just want a function that gives the latest finalized output root which some of the proposed `AnchorStateRegistry` changes may give if it only updates after the air gap and has a single anchor state for all game types.\r\n\r\nI'd expect that `respectedGameType` is a key part of the withdrawal workflow and we need to preserve compatibility for it. You need to know what type of game to use when proving your withdrawal.  We could deprecate it and keep something around for backwards compatibility for a while then delete later but I don't think should just break it.  That one use in viem likely translates to a _lot_ of users depending on it.\r\n\r\nSame for `checkWithdrawal`, it seems important to expose a simple way for callers to ask if a withdrawal is ready to be finalized or not. Ideally we'd have a method that makes it easy to check if a given set of params (eg a game) is suitable to be used to prove a withdrawal - it could then check the blacklist as well which viem doesn't seem to be doing and may cause issues if we ever need to blacklist games.\r\n\r\nThe other question for me is what the point of entry should be for people trying to use the ABI. Do you need to make calls to both `OptimismPortal` and the `IProofSubmitter` implementation? If so, all withdrawal code needs to support all possible proof submitter implementations separately. Ideally I think a withdrawal could be completed using only `OptimismPortal` and be independent of the proof submitter implementation but I'm not sure how you'd find the appropriate game. Not the end of the world if we can't make it that general but having the the main usage be agnostic to the plugin implementation buys us _a lot_ of flexibility. e.g. Succinct could use a different IProofSubmitter implementation and not need to have a custom integration with viem and any other withdrawal tools.\r\n\r\nFor the fall-through code, I'd say that people like succinct maintaining a fork of the OP Stack can easily remove it - they're already maintaining far more complex changes in the fork.\r\n\r\nThe functions with permissioned access are fine to just move as we know they're only used in limited fashion.\r\n\r\nFor monitoring, this shouldn't affect dispute-mon since it only monitors the dispute games. It will likely require updates to our other withdrawal monitoring though and I'm not familiar with how flexible that code is. I don't see anything in this that would hide information and cause monitoring problems - should just be a matter of updating the code to adjust where it gets the info from.", "2024-09-29T21:01:29Z", "2024-09-29T21:01:29Z", "ajsutton", "2025-08-30 21:56:13"]

In other words, the `L1OriginSelector` may need to return `L1Info` and receipts instead of just an `L1BlockRef`, but then the `AttributesBuilder` would not need to make any network calls.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to replace the `L1OriginSelector` with an `AttributesWithOriginSelector` which bundles together these two responsibilities, returning `PayloadAttributes` and an `L1BlockRef` for any new `L2Head`.

["IC_kwDODjvEJM6WGNtl", "I_kwDODjvEJM6h4DvF", "@geoknee and I looked into this. As noted above, I attempted to trigger a chain split using an unpatched version of `op-reth`. However, it appears that the initial values of the EIP1559 params parsed from the extradata (i.e. those coming from the holocene route) are the same as the pre holocene chain spec values. I don't know if it is possible to change the values before the holocene activation in a way which won't break the chain (cause it to halt). Ordinarily we wouldn't set dynamically eip1559 params before holocene activates.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/blob/optimism/consensus/misc/eip1559/eip1559.go#L144\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/blob/optimism/params/config.go#L897-L899\n\nI believe in the case of the Kurtosis setup, both `c.Optimism.EIP1559DenominatorCanyon` and `c.Optimism.EIP1559Denominator` are the same and we're not seeing any difference between the clients due to that?\n\nBased on the above determination, we believe the right next step is to concentrate on another bug https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues/13121 that Minyhuk found, which should allow us to trigger a chain split at any point in time. To do this, we just need to call `setEIP1559Params()` on the SystemConfigProxy L1 contract. This is permissioned and needs to be invoked by the SystemConfigOwner .

["IC_kwDODjvEJM6W0Tbq", "I_kwDODjvEJM6h4DvF", "Earlier today, @geoknee outlined a couple more scenarios for testing with Kurtosis using `op-batcher/v1.10.0-rc.3` image for `op-batcher`. See [discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1244729134312198194/1315746187810439168/1315793026362380401)\n\nEnvironment setup:\n\n* Built an image of the batcher in the monorepo at tag `op-batcher/v1.10.0-rc.3` using `make golang-docker` in the monorepo.\n* Tweaked the kurtosis package yaml to use the custom batcher image:\n\n```\noptimism_package:\n  chains:\n    - participants:\n      - el_type: op-geth\n        cl_type: op-node\n      - el_type: op-reth\n        el_image: \"op-reth:holocene-fix-2\"\n        cl_type: op-node\n      network_params:\n        fjord_time_offset: 0\n        granite_time_offset: 0\n        holocene_time_offset: 10\n      batcher_params:\n        image: us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-batcher:1.10.0\n```\n\n* Built a local `tx-fuzz` image using instructions in: https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/tx-fuzz\n* Created an enclave using the above parameters and started the fuzzer using L2's pre-funded account\n\n```\n./livefuzzer spam  --sk \"0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80\" --rpc http://127.0.0.1:32987 --slot-time 2\n```\n\n## Batcher Restart Test after a Pause\n\n* Initially, verified that the batcher was operating normally using the command `kurtosis service logs <enclave-name> op-batcher-op-kurtosis -f`\n* Stopped the `op-batcher` service: `kurtosis service stop <enclave-name> op-batcher-op-kurtosis`\n* Started the `op-batcher` service after a few minutes using: `kurtosis service start <enclave-name> op-batcher-op-kurtosis`\n\n`op-batcher` appeared to recover correctly after a restart, the logs show that it detected a backlog of blocks and proceeded to work on the backlog successfully and moved forward.\n\n* Logs before restart:\n```\n[op-batcher-op-kurtosis] t=2024-12-10T04:13:15+0000 lvl=info msg=\"Channel is fully submitted\" id=d3e2ec1ba14446bd18c81382f3c78916 min_inclusion_block=46

In which case, while the chain rules aren't desirable, the op-program doesn't diverge from the network. So effectively, it's as if a hf hasn't yet occurred.\n\nThat said, one way around this is to prevent games from being created too soon after setImplementation. This could be an hour or more, with ample time to detect a faulty hardfork.

It would require the ProxyAdminOwner to execute a transaction to do that prestate rollback though.  With or without fault proofs, if proposals were made based on the hard fork being active the guardian would have to invalidate them as part of rolling back the chain.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that games created prior to the hard fork activating are not an issue even if they keep using a prestate that contains the activation. Since the activation block is never reached it won't affect the execution at all.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion if the activation goes badly is to switch to the permissioned game to provide time to rollback the prestate. That will currently invalidate all existing games but with the incident response improvements coming doing so would be optional, so we could choose to just blacklist individual games if there are only a few for blocks with the hard fork activated, but still give us more time to rollback the prestate.", "2024-10-25T00:20:19Z", "2024-10-25T00:20:19Z", "ajsutton", "2025-08-31 00:16:35"]

Currently, we do not have to.\n\nSo I recommend to not change the batch-format, and to make the requests-root part of the block-header (for Pectra compat) but make it implied (root of an always-empty list of requests). Then, when receiving a block from P2P you can assume an empty list of requests. And when building a block, you can assume an empty list of requests. And then there is nothing new to batch-submit. And EL-sync rules can exchange blocks without special changes, and just exchange the block with the empty requests-root. Note that unlike withdrawals, requests are not retained in the execution engine after block execution, and thus also not synced via EL p2p.\n\nThe other EIPs, that introduce requests for various L1 beaconchain related things, can all be adapted such that even if the contract exists and emits an event, no request is actually put in the block. This is a very tiny simple diff.\n", "2025-01-17T16:16:29Z", "2025-01-17T16:16:29Z", "protolambda", "2025-08-31 00:17:47"]

I noticed that the source L2 timestamp is passed there, and I'm curious if you believe this could be a contributing factor.\n\nCould you provide more details on where you think this issue might be originating from?

Then, there are inputs (e.g. what should the new recommended protocol version be) that are read in from a TOML file. So creating a new task from a template would involve scaffolding the directory (like we already do), adding a TOML file with your input parameters, and running the solidity file from the template directory.\n\nIt sounds like what you are describing is for bespoke tasks where you need custom calls and calldata.

["IC_kwDOKIsnqM6PiXo2", "I_kwDOKIsnqM6ZdZOU", "Yes definitely! So I recall last time we chatted about this a tricky part was that the upgrade transactions are executed in this repo, but our test suite is in the monorepo (https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock). However this repo does already have the monorepo as a [dependency](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/blob/808004cd933e0bfa36e6d9124701e296639a6d41/.gitmodules#L7-L10), so that might help\r\n\r\nFirst, some background on the monorepo setup:\r\n- The core test suite is a standard forge test suite. We also have a few kontrol proofs, and a few differential ffi tests to ensure go and solidity implementations match.\r\n- We run all tests (including the go ffi tests) with `just test`, and the proofs are run with `just test-kontrol`.\r\n- Only running `just test` would be be a great start and kontrol can be added later.\r\n\r\nNow on this repo, superchain-ops\r\n- \"Tasks\"are transactions to broadcast, like contract upgrade transactions or transactions that just change a config value. This is essentially the same as what Maker calls \"spells\"\r\n- All tasks live in a directory of `tasks/{L1-network}/{taskName}`, and contain `input.json` bundles that define the transaction to be sent, along with a single solidity script that simulates the task based on that JSON bundle. \r\n- Some tasks are \"single\" meaning it's a regular safe that needs to send the transaction, like the 5/7 Foundation Safe. Other tasks are \"nested\" meaning it's a 2/2 Safe that needs to send the transaction (where each signer on that 2/2 is a Safe, specifically the Foundation and the Security Council)\r\n- The core logic to parse the bundle and simulate the transaction happens using the https://github.com/base-org/contracts/ dependency. We run the simulation in foundry within that dep, and have a `postCheck` hook that runs a bunch of assertions on the post-simulation state\r\n\r\nI would say it's safe to consider most options on the table. Some examples I thought about:\r\n- Does changing the shape of the `input.json` bundles help?\r\n- Does replacing `base-org/contracts` with FPS help?\r\n- Maker executes tests against their proposals like [this](https://github.com/makerdao/spells-mainnet/blob/master/src/DssSpell.t.sol), by basically defining a static test suite that always runs. This could also be an option for us, i.e. parameterize the key tests in the monorepo, that way we can import them here and run them", "2024-10-11T21:37:01Z", "2024-10-11T21:37:01Z", "mds1", "2025-08-31 01:46:32"]

["IC_kwDOKIsnqM6beZak", "I_kwDOKIsnqM6ZdZOU", "After some consideration, we've landed on one possible solution to deliver this feature. \n\nAt a high-level, we want to be able to grab the resultant state from the task that ran and then use that state inside the monorepos tests.\n\nTo do this, we can use a combination of foundry cheatcodes. Firstly, we can use [`dumpState(string calldata pathToStateJson)`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/blob/master/src/Vm.sol#L1858). This produces a JSON file that contains allocs created during the duration of the script. e.g. \n\n```json\n{\n    \"0x5aadfb43ef8daf45dd80f4676345b7676f1d70e3\": {\n        \"nonce\": \"0x1\",\n        \"balance\": \"0x0\",\n        \"code\": \"0x68.......\",\n        \"storage\": {\n            \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\",\n            \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\": \"0x68656c6c6f00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith these allocs, we can _then_ use another foundry cheat code, namely [`loadAllocs(string calldata pathToAllocsJson)`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/blob/master/src/Vm.sol#L1875). This loads in everything in the json file (_addresses, code, nonces, balances, state etc_). e.g. \n\n```solidity\nvm.loadAllocs(\"../state3.json\");\nconsole.log(foo.val()); // would've reverted if loadAllocs had not have been invoked.\n```\nA note worth mentioning is that before we load allocations using the JSON file, we may want to do some processing to the file. As we know, deployments won't occur in superchain-ops tasks, so we may be able to remove any allocs that contain a `code` property, for example e.g. `MultisigTask` or `AddressRegistry`. \n\n\n---\nEach test in the monorepo has the following structure: \n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1143d4b2-3f22-40c8-bf07-898f949a05ee)\n\nWe will want to integrate our new logic into the above architecture. We don't want our new logic to live within [`Deploy.s.sol`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/de3865c0a2d32821faa19165ff1a3232589b90c1/packages/contracts-bedrock/scripts/deploy/Deploy.s.sol#L4) because we _don't_ want to deploy a new chain (proxies, implementation contracts etc). The reason being that all superchain-ops tasks work on existing chain states and in _most_ (if not all) cases, they don't deploy contracts as part of the task (think setting a new gas limit on an already existing SystemConfig contract). \n\nOur new logic will want to leverage [`ForkLive.s.sol`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/test/setup/ForkLive.s.sol). Currently, `ForkLive.s.sol` reads addresses for a given network (mainnet/sepolia) from the superchain-registry and stores then so that they can be accessed later. This only grabs addresses for one chain at a time (e.g. base, zora or op), we may want to update this logic or loop at a higher level for all the chains in the superchain-ops task. \n\nWe will need to update many files, not limited to: \n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/blob/main/single.just\n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/blob/main/nested.just\n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml\n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/justfile#L72\n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/test/setup/ForkLive.s.sol\n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/test/setup/Setup.sol\n", "2025-01-22T22:57:47Z", "2025-01-22T22:57:47Z", "blmalone", "2025-08-31 01:46:32"]

Therefore, removing them is important to keep the allocs from the simulation as close to the production allocs as possible. \n\nIn order to correctly identify the allocs we need to remove from the dumped state, we want to make sure that the deployed contracts have a deterministic address. \nWe have a few options to realize this.

However, there are some approaches you can consider to achieve similar functionality:\n\n1. Scheduled Pipelines: You can create a scheduled pipeline that runs on a specific branch, but it won't automatically run against all PR branches. As mentioned in the [Scheduled pipelines documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/scheduled-pipelines/), \"A scheduled pipeline can only be configured for one branch. If you need to schedule for two branches, you would need to set up two schedules.\"\n\n2. Dynamic Branch Selection: You could create a scheduled pipeline that dynamically selects branches to run against. This approach is described in the [How can I dynamically select branches for a scheduled pipeline?](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/15334848949403-How-can-I-dynamically-select-branches-for-a-scheduled-pipeline) article. You would need to create a custom script to get a list of PR branches and update the scheduled pipeline to run against those branches.\n\n3. Workflow Filtering: You can use workflow filtering to run jobs on specific branches or tags. However, this is typically used for running jobs when commits are pushed, not on a schedule for all PR branches.\n\n4. API-based Approach: You could create a separate scheduled job that uses the CircleCI API to trigger builds for all open PR branches. This would require custom scripting and is not a built-in feature of CircleCI.\n\nIt's important to note that CircleCI's default behavior is to run builds on every commit pushed to a branch, unless you've specifically configured it otherwise. As stated in a [forum post](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/9874): \"All commits on all branches build normally, unless you have blacklisted or whitelisted them.\"\n\nTo achieve your specific goal, you might need to combine scheduled pipelines with custom scripting to dynamically update the branches being tested. This would require additional setup and is not a straightforward configuration in CircleCI.\n", "2025-02-04T17:48:08Z", "2025-02-04T17:48:08Z", "ElliotFriedman", "2025-08-31 01:46:32"]

I am recording the decisions so we can remember and vet them.\n\n### Integration Points\n- We're adding a new Event Type which is handled by a Chain Processor which indicates a database inconsistency was detected, and invalidation is required\n- The Event Type specifies what the originating cause of the invalid data is\n- These events are generated:\n  - When `rangeUpdate` fails, which happens if logs can't extend the database (ie an Unsafe Reorg is likely)\n  - When an L1 block is detected which doesn't extend the known L1 block in the L1 Accessor (ie an L1 Reorg is likely)\n\nWhen these events are generated, they are caught and handled by an invalidation function which must always:\n- Determine what databases are affected (L2 only, or L1&L2). If the consistency check failed during Log Indexing, it should only be the Event DB, but if it's a larger Reorg, it should rewind the Event *and* Derivation DBs.\n- Determine the last healthy point in the database. Event Emitters can't tell us this because whatever invalidated the consistency check may also invalidate arbitrary historical entries too.\n- Rewind the database to the healthy point\n\nWe are making some assumptions on how things will play out:\n- The observation of *where* a database inconsistency is found can limit the scope of the database truncations we do. For example, if the inconsistency is found during indexing of unsafe data, we can truncate just the Event DB, even if the Derivation DBs managed to become inconsistent at the same time (due to some extreme race). We make this assumption because the Derivation DB will also discover inconsistency and will result in a secondary truncation that cleans everything up again\n- If we truncate the databases back, we do not need to explicitly manage the reset of the node. Instead, when the node takes further actions, it will generate `ErrOutOfOrder` which will work as a signal to reset the node.\n- Database Corruption or other \"out of sync\" issues will manifest as consistency failures in other pathways, so we don't need to do special work to detect these. If no consistency checks ever fail, the database must not be corrupt.\n\nThe summary of our assumptions is that we believe that we can act on consistency failures by truncating the databases, and we don't need to be exhaustive about returning the system to a consistent state. Instead, other activities will emergently re-sync or further rewind the components.\n\nGiven these assumptions, the work to be done seems very simple:\n- Emit and Handle the new Inconsistency Event\n- Wire up and use all the correct `Rewind` functions\n- [Optional] refactor the block invalidation to use the same system as everything else\n\nWe also might want to locate this invalidation handler somewhere *above* the ChainProcessor, since a Chain Processor is designated to a single chain, while an L1-reorg will affect *all chains*. Maybe if the ChainID in the event is \"All\", it applies to all processors? @tyler-smith wdyt?\n\nLooking for @protolambda 's thoughts on the matter, especially the assumptions we've made.", "2025-01-22T20:39:34Z", "2025-01-22T20:39:34Z", "axelKingsley", "2025-08-31 01:47:13"]

["IC_kwDODjvEJM6ZjgRY", "I_kwDODjvEJM6gdWXL", "## Context\n\nThere are basically two upgrade paths for an proxy being upgraded: \n\n1. Logic only upgrades: handled via `ProxyAdmin.upgrade()`\n2. Logic and state upgrades: handled via `ProxyAdmin.upgradeAndCall()` where the data is a call to the release specific `upgrade()` function.\n\nCase 1 is simple. Case 2 requires us to ensure that the `upgrade()` function cannot be called a second time. We can achieve that by:\n\n1. using an industry standard off the shelf component.\n2. reusing the release version so as to not add a new constant that needs to be tracked.\n\n## Reinitializer Implementation Details\n\n1. We'll use OpenZeppelin v5's `Initializable` to ensure that `initialize()` and `upgrade()` can only be called once.\n2. The v5 version of `Initializable` use a uint64 to store the initialization state, and allows reinitialization if the new version is greater than the current version.\n\nAll contracts which require an `upgrade()` function should be reinitialized with the new version. This version will be stored in a new library `Release.sol`:\n\n```solidity\n/// @title Release\n/// @notice Library for handling release versioning with padded spacing\nlibrary Release {\n\n    /// @notice Version identifier, used for upgrades.\n    uint32 constant MAJOR = 2;\n    uint16 constant MINOR = 3;\n    uint16 constant PATCH = 4;\n\n    /// @notice Spacing constants for version components.\n    /// @dev These values are used to convert the MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH components to a uint64.\n    uint64 constant SPACING = 1_000_000;\n\n    /// @notice Converts release components to a uint64 with padding\n    /// @return version Padded version number as uint64\n    function toUint64() internal pure returns (uint64 version) {\n        // Calculate padded version number\n        version = uint64((MAJOR * SPACING ** 2) + (MINOR * SPACING) + PATCH);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThus `toUint64(2,1,1)` will return `2000003000004` (we can fiddle with the spacing here). It might be better to use bit shifting instead of multiplication and division, but this was an easy demo.\n\n## Emergency Patch Scenario Example\n\nIt's important to think through how this will affect different upgrade apths.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\n- Chains A, B: Running `v2.0.0`\n- Chains C, D: Already upgraded to `v2.1.0`\n- Critical issue discovered in `v2.0.0` that needs immediate fixing\n\n## Procedure\n\n- Create a new branch from the `v2.0.0` tag\n- Implement fix on the `v2.0.0` branch\n- Create new release `v2.0.1`\n- Deploy a new OPCM for `v2.0.1`\n- Upgrade the affected chains from `v2.0.0` to `v2.0.1`\n\nThen there are two possible scenarios for upgrading those chains from `v2.0.1` to `v2.1.0`:\n\n1. OPCM 2.0.0 does not work for that upgrade path. In this case we will need to deploy a special purpose OPCM `v2.1.0-patch-from-2.0.0`\n1. OPCM 2.1.0 already works for that upgrade path (this would need to be tested and verified).\n\nMy intuition is that the second case is much more likely in most scenarios, but we do at least have a path forward in the event of the first case.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe primary risk is that upgrading to a new `Initializable` version, will migrates the location of the `initialized()`. This is pretty straightforward to test and mitigate though.\n\nMitigations: \n\n1.  exposed the `_initialized` value so that the OPCM can assert that all affected contracts are indeed initialized.\n2. Add tests (including on the Forked upgrade test path) to show that it's impossible to call either `initialize` or `upgrade` after the upgrade.\n3.

I think the premise of the task is no longer correct, but there is still some work to be done.\n\nIn the past, it was possible for a Supervisor to:\n- Sync from node inputs\n- Go down for some period\n- Nodes experience a reorg in the meantime\n- Supervisor comes back up and needs to acclimate to the post-reorg reality. The supervisor should prune and resync now (this task)\n\n**Thinking about L1 Reorgs Specifically** -- \nBecause L1 data *must* flow through the Supervisor, any L1 reorg will be experienced by the Supervisor first, and nodes couldn't possibly experience one without the Supervisor actively driving it.\n\nA Supervisor would:\n- Sync from node inputs (based on L1 references *it* provides)\n- Go down for some period\n- Nodes *will not* process any new L1 inputs because the Supervisor can't supply them\n- Supervisor comes back up, and starts driving the nodes again\n\nBecause the Supervisor holds the truth, it is actually the Node who will experience a reset, which will happen as soon as the Supervisor notices the mismatch.\n\n**Thinking about L2 Reorgs Specifically** -- \nIt is possible that some indexed log data may become invalid during the time the Supervisor is down. The Node would provide Logs some logs to the Supervisor, and while the Supervisor is down an unsafe reorg occurs, making these logs invalid. Then, when the Supervisor comes back up, it knows to request the next available data, and what it discovers is that the new log data (or derived L2 data) *does not* build on the data already had in the Supervisor.\n\nThis unsafe reorg case would indeed need handling -- the Supervisor should correctly walk-back the node with incremental resets, and they would eventually arrive at the same head. However, the Supervisor would *also* need to prune data in this case, since resetting the node is only part of the solution, without pruning the op-node would go right back to suggesting log data which can't sit on top of the database.", "2025-01-15T20:23:03Z", "2025-01-15T20:23:03Z", "axelKingsley", "2025-08-31 01:47:14"]

So at timestamp X+1, we will have a super root containing `(a1, b0)`. If `a1` references anything in `b1` it will have to be found to be invalid by the proof system because `b1` doesn't exist yet and it may not even have batch data available on L1 yet.\n\nI struggle to see how it could ever be safe to have executing messages that reference a block with a later timestamp because the world view of proofs is limited by a timestamp and nothing after that proposal timestamp exists.", "2025-02-14T03:36:27Z", "2025-02-14T03:36:27Z", "ajsutton", "2025-08-31 01:48:28"]

It should be possible for a sequencer to build blocks more slowly if they are not seeing a lot of throughput. Decoupling the timestamps helps enable this. To be able to build blocks slower than the base chain, we would need https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/416. The tradeoff with allowing the sequencer to build blocks arbitrarily slowly is that it could delay deposits. There would need to be a rule where blocks can be produced lazily when there are no deposits and then progression is forced when a deposit is observed.\n\nAfter thinking about this more, I am much more in favor of a timestamp based gas limit than an epoch based gas limit. We could keep the exact same timestamp rules with sequencer drift and have a cap of 4 blocks with the same timestamp and overload the definition of gas limit to mean \"gas limit of blocks with same timestamp\". This guarantees progression of the timestamp and opens up innovation at the block builder layer, which we are already seeing with rbuilder/rollup boost. Its a complex optimization problem to build blocks that are cheap to batch submit and also earn more fees.\n\nWe would also need a way to determine the total ordering of blocks with the same timestamp, to which @protolambda has previously suggested we could overload the block header's nonce field for this.\n\nThe `op-node` could at first implement a naive block building process that updates the timestamp in a very simple way and we can then build blocks faster in the future without needing to introduce any protocol changes.", "2024-12-11T20:37:00Z", "2024-12-11T20:37:00Z", "tynes", "2025-08-31 03:24:22"]

I bridge it to an L1 token, which needs to be an `OptimismMintableERC20`, meaning it has a `remoteToken()` getter.\n3. I then try to bridge that L1 token to a token on Base at 0xabcd. In doing so, the Base bridge will call `_isCorrectTokenPair(0xabcd)`, because `0xabcd != 0x1234` it will return false and the deposit will fail.\n4. So there is an edge case where if the L2 token had the same address on both Base and OP Mainnet, the bridge would work, but this is often untrue.\n\nThis is an artifact of the bridge having been designed prior to the superchain vision being well formed. Tokens created by the OptimismERC20TokenFactory now have the same address on each chain, but that wasn't always the case, and not all tokens are created that way. \n\nTBH I don't think we're likely to prioritize fixing this directly, but once we launch interop, the recommended way to do this would be to move coins directly between L2s rather than via L1.

Although this rule does make things difficult because it means Isthmus is not equivalent to a non-nil, non-empty withdrawals hash. And we are clearly leaning on this incorrect assumption in the p2p part of the stack.\n\nIf the empty withdrawals hash were to be used at genesis with isthmus active, we would then use BlockV3 when marshalling the execution payload as described above. \n[According to the spec, we should use BlockV4 for all Isthmus blocks](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/isthmus/exec-engine.html#genesis-block), so this is a spec violation. However,  think it may be simpler to change the spec to use BlockV3 for edge cases such as this.\n\nI have been unable to reproduce this so far, since on kurtosis as well as for out devnets when activating Isthmus at genesis, the `L2toL1MessagePasser` has a non nil, non empty value `0x8ed4baae3a927be3dea54996b4d5899f8c01e7594bf50b17dc1e741388ce3d12` (this is as expected, it stores the proxy owner and the implementation address).\n\nEDIT: to clarify, it seems impossible to get an empty storage object for this contract when rolling an OPStack chain in the usual way. Therefore it seems impossible to run into this bug (we will probably still address it, but want to understand how you triggered it). \n\n@kien-rise can you provide any more details to allow us to reproduce?

Because many chains in the superchain currently have different versions of their L1 contracts, upgrading contracts requires a time consuming process of tracking every different version of the contracts for different chains and handling each upgrade differently.\nIf we do nothing, the contract changes for Isthmus would force us to perform the same time consuming manual tasks to track down all versions of the contracts and require more work to get all contracts to the same version.\n2. If we keep adding chains to the SC with our upgrades process as-is, there is an enormous amount of increased manual labor for the OP Labs security team and for the Security Council. This includes manual validation of every storage slot, for every upgrade, for every chain\u2014along with the ability to track any subtle variations that may exist for chains that are on different versions. This creates a lot of surface area for something to go wrong. \n**Solution**\n1. OPCM upgrades will allow us to easily get all chains in the Superchain to the same version of the contracts with the Isthmus upgrade(although some chains *will* be permissioned vs. permissionless), making this version hell a thing of the past.\n2. OPCM streamlines the security council signing process \n\n**Risks**\nIf we do not thoroughly test out the OPCM upgrade for Isthmus on devnets before the Isthmus testnet upgrade we could risk errors in the upgrade process.\n", "2025-01-06T21:39:20Z", "2025-01-06T21:39:20Z", "K-Ho", "2025-08-31 03:32:01"]

At least compared to the cost of block derivation. This is based on microbenchmarks targeting the worst case behavior in each area.\nFor example, opening a block to decode its messages is inexpensive to execute. And we take care to memoize such operations so that multiple messages references use a cached result.\n\nThe remaining hazard that I'm not certain on is the canonical chain walkback. We can resolve this uncertainty with a microbenchmark. Which can be done as part of https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15285 on eth-sepolia with 2 months of EIP-2935 history.

["IC_kwDODjvEJM6s8KbF", "I_kwDODjvEJM63rXy8", "This comment describes the impacts the current dispute game architecture has on devrel/EVM Safety. These stem from two main causes\n- This issue\n- The dispute games not being MCP (Multi-Chain Prep) compatible (i.e. no immutables)\n\nWe walk through a typical protocol lifecycle to demonstrate the impacts:\n- A new chain launches straight to permissioned, due to the cyclical dependency we currently have. They don't exist yet so aren't in the superchain registry (SR), so I believe we pass a prestate that won't actually work for them\n- They get added to the SR, and now a hard fork comes. What do we do here? There is no \"official\" guidance about whether we need to deploy a new permissioned dispute game (~4M gas) with a new absolute prestate, even though there's no reason to play a game on permissioned chains. This often happens automatically through OPCM, so in addition to process confusion we also increase gas cost + state diff validation overhead unnecessarily here\n- Now they upgrade to permissionless. We call a method on OPCM which costs 4M+ gas to deploy the new game implementation. Expensive, but no real issue\n- Next time there is a hard fork, it costs 8M+ gas to ugprade this chain (4M for each game). This means we can only upgrade 3 chains at once. OP governance contains ~10 chains, meaning there are 4 playbooks (5 once you include Base) to create, sequence, sign, and execute for every hard fork or contracts update. This adds a lot of operational overhead for various stakeholders (playbook creators, playbook reviewers, governance, signers, auditors who review playbooks, bug bounty hunters who review our calldata). Interop doesn't help here much (yet) since the initial interop set is only 2 chains, so it reduces the number of dispute games to deploy from 20 to 18 (since the interop set shares a dispute game)\n\nIn summary:\n- Permissioned dispute games having prestates results in lack of process clarity for devrel / new chains / upgrades of permissioned chains\n- Deploying dispute games is too expensive which results in significant release process overhead. This can be cut down in two ways: making then MCP-compatible, and simplifying permissioned dispute games", "2025-05-22T14:30:01Z", "2025-05-22T14:31:34Z", "mds1", "2025-08-31 04:57:37"]

["IC_kwDODjvEJM6tAlgs", "I_kwDODjvEJM63rXy8", "Thanks for the detail.  I'm definitely in favour of this simplification, but just to drill down on these impacts a bit, it sounds like most of them are because of the lack of MCP compatibility (all the gas costs for example) which is being fixed separately and doesn't require changing the permissioned game implementations.\n\n> The assumption of a chain using a PermissionedDisputeGame is the the chain operator is the sole proposer, they are proposing valid output roots, and are not going to challenge their own claims. I think there is a scenario where this can happen, but out of an operational mistake.\n\nIt is possible they counter themselves, unless they do so 72 times (bearing in mind the challenger role should be a multisig so that's a _lot_ of signing) the game can still be made to resolve correctly. Simplifying the permissioned game would actually make this slightly worse - if you incorrectly challenge a proposal once it would be permanently invalid.\n\n> Permissioned dispute games having prestates results in lack of process clarity for devrel / new chains / upgrades of permissioned chains\n\nWe could also address this by just asserting that the permissioned game always has a fixed prestate and not ever expect it to have the correct chain config. ie: we can avoid these impacts via a policy change which we could adopt immediately and not have to wait on developer resources being available, gov cycles etc. We may need to update superchain-ops templates (and maybe OPCM for some cases?) for updating the prestates for hard forks so it doesn't bother with the permissioned game.\n\nAnd again for clarity, I'm definitely keen to do the simplification but that isn't going to be possible to ship prior to interop so will be months away at the earliest even ignoring other possible priorities.", "2025-05-22T21:27:12Z", "2025-05-22T21:27:12Z", "ajsutton", "2025-08-31 04:57:37"]

It would explain why having more block topics is harmful to p2p gossip (more topics scored where there is no traffic, penalising peers). \n\nIt does suggest that the correct way to do this is either:\n1. Remove per-topic peer scoring entirely (set the weight to zero). Keep global peer scoring, though. This would be easy to implement.\n2. Have dynamic behaviour where nodes enter and exit different topics as hardfork activations happen. This would be a bigger lift and I'm not sure it is worth it.

["IC_kwDOL-xLQ86oMD7b", "I_kwDOL-xLQ86wroFu", "Hi, here are some insights I can share which can help steering the implementation in the right direction.\n\n- **Definition of divergence**\n    - When two nodes (geth/reth) respond with different stateRoot-hex-strings at the same block height, they're divergent.\n- **Regarding my work in the past**\n    - We always wanted to ensure that whenever a reth-based sequencer operates as a leader and diverges from a geth-based non-leader sequencer, we should transfer the leadership to the geth-based sequencer. \n    - Here's the runbook relating to it - [ref](https://www.notion.so/oplabs/Runbook-op-reth-diverges-from-op-geth-151f153ee162806eb8f1c323233043eb)\n- replica-healthcheck is a very lightweight component which already is capable of tracking such divergence. \n    - It runs on a per-node (per-geth or per-reth), basically, tracking if that node is diverging (or stalling) or not.\n    - It has two inputs:\n        - target RPC: the EL URL of the component whose divergence needs to be tracked\n        - reference RPC: the EL URL which is considered to be the source of truth of block height and state roots.\n    - replica-healthcheck simply queries these two RPCs (with `eth_getBlockByNumber` method) to see if there's any certain block height where state root reported by target RPC and reference RPC differs. \n    - It reports the results as Prometheus metrics which we visualize [here](https://optimistic.grafana.net/d/n-MDITAVz/replica-healthcheck?orgId=1&from=now-12h&to=now&timezone=browser&var-network=arena-z-sepolia-prod&var-instance=$__all&var-target=$__all)\n\n\n## My ideas regarding this ticket\n\nThis devnet acceptance test can do one of two things:\n1. Just minimally do what replica-healthcheck does:\n    - Take two inputs (resembling replica-healthcheck)\n        - target RPC would be the URL of the reth-node which it wants to check for divergence (Can be `http://op-reth:8545` if the test would run literally within the same namespace as that reth-node)\n        - reference RPC would be the URL of any geth-based node/sequencer in the same devnet (considering we want to see if a reth-based node diverges from geth-based or not)\n    - Use the `eth_getBlockByNumber latest` RPC to last matching block heights between target and reference RPC:\n        - so if target RPC (the reth node)'s tip is at block height 42 and reference RPC's tip is at 69, the last matching block height is 42\n    - Check at this last matching block height (42) if the `stateRoot` is same or not for target RPC and reference RPC\n        - If it's same, there's no divergence.\n        - If it's different, there's divergence.\n            - Optionally, the point/block of divergence can be simply found through binary searching between block number 0 and 42 i.e. finding the last block number where the state roots were same for both the target and reference RPC.\n2. Re-use replica-healthcheck:\n    - Configure replica-healthcheck per every reth-based node in the devnet where:\n        - target RPC would be `http://op-reth:8545` (because we deploy replica-healthcheck in the same namespace as the reth-node)\n        - reference RPC would be the URL of any geth-based node/sequencer in the same devnet.\n    - The acceptance test then just checks for `healthcheck_height_difference` and `healthcheck_last_matching_state_root_height` to exactly if and where the divergence occurred between any reth and geth based node.\n\nI would prefer the former approach (i.e. lightweight re-implementation of what replica-healthcheck does) because:\n- It's easier to script/automate from a testability standpoint.\n- IIUC, there's already a set of acceptance tests in Go. So this re-implementation can be appended to that existing suite of tests easily.\n- Operationally there's no effort to deploy anything new like replica-healthcheck per reth-based node.\n- You can have a modified implementation if need be unlike re-using replica-healthcheck whose source code we aren't maintaining anymore.\n\nBut again, I have no experience with setting up and running acceptance tests so feel free to let me know if I am missing something or if you'd like to seek answers to any other questions.\n\nCheers!", "2025-04-22T15:39:35Z", "2025-04-22T15:39:35Z", "yashvardhan-kukreja", "2025-08-31 04:58:43"]

I don't understand the challenger and the SafeDB API well enough to see how this just works. From what I can tell, the safe db only provides the query `SafeHeadAtL1Block(ctx context.Context, l1BlockNum uint64) (*eth.SafeHeadResponse, error)` which translates an L1 block number to the latest L2 safe head ID and the L1 block ID for this number. This feels the other way around than the mapping that is needed to construct the super roots, L2 derived -> L1 source. I can see how the required mapping could be derived from the safe db API but it doesn't seem straight forward. But it's probably just my very limited understanding of how Interop proofs work.\n2. We actually start indexing the safe db in the supervisor just at the first random derived block it receives, even if it's pre-Interop. Then it could serve the super roots the same way it does now. This means we'd just remove any special meaning of the _first block_ in the safe db. We would still only start indexing logs in the events db after the Interop activation block.

It would mean you need to have run the supervisor from whatever anchor state we pick but that fits well with us getting people to run it well ahead of interop anyway.

Post-merge can be longer and for some types of tests reducing runtime either isn't an objective or isn't feasible (e.g. sync tests or long running performance tests).\n* The idea of disabling checks that are breaking seems wrong. If they're new checks then yes we should roll them back, but otherwise it is generally a very bad idea to disable checks and can lead to multiple issues slipping through which make it very hard to get back to things passing.\n* PR merge time is mostly dependent on when people provide reviews and how much rework/discussion is required.

But in practice it's not used well.\n\nI think the jutfile situation is bad, because it duplicated configuration, and makes every service build slightly differently for no reason.\n\nIf we add a go-releaser config, let's remove all justfile/makefile/bake references. There should be 1 way to prepare docker images and release builds. Not so many as we have now.\n\n#### op-deployer config (as-is) is not a good example\n\nAlso, the op-deployer makefile/justfile setup still has inconsistencies with git versioning, and a configuration entry-point from the op-chain-ops dir where it used to be located, that is half-broken, like here: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/bfb9de2081a8fef8ae998025e1a8ca0510bd5c45/op-chain-ops/justfile#L8\n\nop-deployer also introduces a separate `Dockerfile`, which is nice in theory, but the Docker build caching and maintainability is only getting worse the more we split it. The `ops/docker/op-stack-go/Dockerfile` should unify it, and support the proper Go module download and build caching. (does GoReleaser handle docker-layer-caching and Go build caching between different sub-modules?)\n\nGoReleaser is good. Taking previous rushed build systems as example for GoReleaser is not. \n\nAnd duplicating go-releaser complexity for N services without removing debt here first is even worse. If we do what op-deployer does we end up with N different configs and inconsistent docker base images and build systems etc. to maintain.

I propose removing (or commenting out) the `print` call in `simulateRun` to reduce unnecessary logs during simulation, which should allow users to focus on the critical signing information.\n\nDoes this change meet the expectations for resolving the issue, or would you prefer a more selective reduction of the output instead of removing it entirely?

This could be more robust than how we currently define them in `.env` files. E.g. in each tasks main dir (`eth` etc), we could have a config like `safes.toml` that defines a list of safes with aliases, e.g.\n```toml\n[safes.l1poa]\ndesc = \"Superchain L1 ProxyAdminOwner\"\naddress = \"0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A\"\nowners = [\"fus\", \"scs\"]\n\n[safes.fus]\ndesc = \"Foundation Upgrade Safe\"\naddress=\"0x847B5c174615B1B7fDF770882256e2D3E95b9D92\"\n\n[safes.scs]\ndesc = \"Security Council Safe\"\naddress=\"0xc2819DC788505Aac350142A7A707BF9D03E3Bd03\"\n```\n\nThen in each individual task folder, we could have a `task.toml` file that defines some metadata about the task, e.g.\n```toml\ntype = \"nested\"\nexecuter = \"l1poa\"\n```\nand then the smart per-L1 stacked task executor can use this metadata to calculate determine nonces etc.", "2024-12-20T12:30:52Z", "2024-12-20T12:34:01Z", "sebastianst", "2025-08-31 06:28:02"]

And if interop is not active at genesis, no interop contracts are included at all. So if you use an op-deployer that's capable of deploying CrossL2Inbox, it will only be deployed if there are multiple chains.

If it's timing out / not doing a final forkchoice update, then something in the block-processing itself is wrong or is hitting a performance issue, and that then needs further investigation before we can fix it.\r\n\r\nRegarding leadership transfer:\r\n\r\n1. conductor did indeed [try to insert this committed payload content into op-node](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-conductor/conductor/service.go#L766) if it does not have it already (only for the latest block)\r\n2. currently the issue here is not the timeout, it has already received p2p payload and tried to insert it (timed out), it is that when op-conductor tries to insert the payload again, because the payload is already inside the [payloadsQueue](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-node/rollup/clsync/clsync.go#L175), it will [return immediately](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-node/rollup/clsync/clsync.go#L175-L178) without calling `ForkChoiceUpdateRequest` later. => a immediate thought is to allow conductor to bypass the check (keep other behaviors the same), but not sure if that is the most elegant solution", "2024-10-16T02:55:28Z", "2024-10-16T02:59:12Z", "0x00101010", "2025-08-31 06:31:40"]

Perhaps the rest of the network learns about the unsafe reorg quickly, or only after the batcher posts the reorged chain, but again this is not a batcher concern.

["IC_kwDODjvEJM7BrR92", "I_kwDODjvEJM7JUN70", "Hi @ajsutton, that's a fair question. I happen to work on a fork of optimism, and in maintaining that fork I found that in updating one dependency (`github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub v0.12.0 => v0.14.2`) I was suddenly seeing some tests panic.\n\nIn particular, [TestDiscovery](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-node/p2p/host_test.go#L265) (this is skipped in your develop branch, but isn't in mine) and at least one other I can't recall. The message is as follows:\n\n```\npanic: runtime error: slice bounds out of range [4:0]\n\ngoroutine 198 [running]:\ngithub.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub.(*GossipSubRouter).heartbeat(0xc000576fc8)\n\t/home/jwood/go/pkg/mod/github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub@v0.14.2/gossipsub.go:1538 +0x265c\ngithub.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub.(*PubSub).processLoop(0xc000577208, {0x2161b88, 0x343aae0})\n\t/home/jwood/go/pkg/mod/github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub@v0.14.2/pubsub.go:861 +0xc45\ncreated by github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub.NewPubSub in goroutine 52\n\t/home/jwood/go/pkg/mod/github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub@v0.14.2/pubsub.go:543 +0xea5\nFAIL\tgithub.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/op-node/p2p\t0.137s\nFAIL\n```\n\nI initially thought that this was a bug in `github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub` since generally code should never see a panic like this. I filed an [issue](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/issues/634) there, but the reality is that the code there makes a few assumptions about the config that if met would make this perfectly safe - one of which is that `Dscore` must be less than `Dhi`. Thanks to MarcoPolo over there, I found that in this test `Dhi=0` and `Dscore=4`\n\nThat led me to the test setup [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-node/p2p/host_test.go#L288) where the config is created directly in the test and `MeshDHi` is unset (thus defaults to 0). I reasoned that not setting this value was meant to leave it at the default, which [is set to 12](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-node/p2p/gossip.go#L42). However, as I point out in the description this default is clobbered by the 0 that was (unintentionally) set in the setup of the test.", "2025-09-03T13:50:48Z", "2025-09-03T13:50:48Z", "wood-jp", "2025-09-04 02:25:12"]

I've seen this pattern in many other places, I just don't find it idiomatic. The Config struct is rather large through, so this may end up the better solution in the end - especially if it might grow even larger.\n\nThe PR I've provided is how I've chosen to solve the problem on my end.

I suspect `kurtosis` jobs and `go-tests-short` since they're some of the longest ones but trying to verify that.\n2. Does most of the friction come from the fact that ci automates prerequisite setup steps before running the tests, whereas locally you have to manually piece together the setup before running some tests?\n3. Would you find it valuable to automate validation of circleci config.yml syntax?\n\n(from @teddyknox)\n1. Getting the proofs tests running locally would be useful, since they have a lot of prerequisite dependency steps that make them harder to run. In general there's always the off chance you push some code that breaks proofs, but it's unlikely you'd catch this before pushing to origin with a local test run. go-tests-short runs locally via makefile but is no longer short, I think we have some work to do recategorizing the tests within it. If we wanted to solve this once and for all, we'd have a tool to update go testing manifests automatically by:\n  a. Timing the test run of each go package\n  b. Sorting ascending\n  c. Greedily packing these packages into manifest files for 1m, 5m, 10m, 20m, 1h testing jobs\n  d. Creating those 1m, 5m, 10m, 20m, 1h testing jobs that consume these manifest files\n2. Yes, exactly. This, plus the fact that some build steps are not cached I believe.\n3. This might be helpful for engineers modifying the circleci config in the future but in general that seems like a different problem to be solving than users looking to run tests locally.\n\n(from @bitwiseguy)\n\nInteresting idea about dynamically sorting the go tests by test time. A few questions on that:\n1. By \"go testing manifests\" you mean [these make recipes](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/Makefile#L255-L278)?\n2. Perhaps this could work by a ci job querying circleci api for test statistics of last n runs, then sorting the tests into group based on that? Or you want that sorting to happen locally?\n3. Are you thinking test jobs that take longer than a given threshold (>10m?) would run as post-merge instead of pre-merge? Or what's the main benefit you hope to get from sorting them?\n\n(from @teddyknox)\n1. These manifests would be new files that specify lists of go packages, and would pair with new go make recipes that correspond to the test tasks of different durations.\n2. Feels like something we should run locally so that the tests are sorted based on laptop run duration rather than CI run duration. Ideally it would be a script we run locally once in a while which updates the manifests. Then we could commit the updated manifests into VCS to share.\n3. Yes, past a different threshold test jobs should probably run post-merge. The main benefit I see is that a large part of why devs don't run tests locally at the moment is because they take too long, so triaging the tests by duration would allow devs to run the greatest number of tests in the time budget they have (by selecting which test job to run, i.e. which duration). Ideally the jobs would reference each other, so if you run the 1h+ job you are running all tests.", "2025-09-03T14:55:23Z", "2025-09-03T14:55:23Z", "bitwiseguy", "2025-09-04 02:25:12"]

From what I can tell it's used primarily when initializing a geth node with a live tracer (a sidecar-like program that does additional processing for the chain, e.g. to index data), but that's not used much.\n\nI think it's best if you mod op-geth for the one-time import of state, by:\n- not storing this alloc data as flat json blob (comment out the `rawdb.WriteGenesisStateSpec` call)\n- still do the other work of importing the state into the DB\n\nAnd additionally, you should include the `stateHash` attribute of the genesis block into the chain-`config` part of the `genesis.json`: this way fresh nodes start with an empty DB but valid genesis-block header, and can snap-sync the state from other bootstrap nodes. Without that `stateHash`, and without a full genesis state, it wouldn't otherwise be able to determine the state-root attribute of the genesis block.\n\nThis is basically how op-mainnet works, by migrating it once, and then doing the DB init in new nodes in a way that can sync from the bootstrapped nodes. We never actually embed the full genesis state alloc into the op-geth binary. (7GB op-geth binary or docker image would be way too big anyway). But thanks to the `stateHash` attribute, the correct genesis block can be loaded, and from there it can snap-sync state of another node.\n\nThere might be some other minor quirks when importing state or starting the node, just let me know, it should be possible to resolve by following the same strategy as with op-mainnet.\n", "2025-09-05T15:14:50Z", "2025-09-05T15:14:50Z", "protolambda", "2025-10-13 20:33:46"]

["IC_kwDODjvEJM7DJFuW", "I_kwDODjvEJM7Gwh0j", "Sat down with @yashvardhan-kukreja yesterday about this. The TLDR is that while the process of building and delivering flashblocks container images to our registry should be improved both for reliability and for security, there is no novel risk to treat here. We currently accept the same risk for all other images, including both first party images produced in CI and 3rd party images. **The best short term mitigation for this risk is to hardcode the image digest of the latest image that was manually built in the kubernetes deployment manifests, meaning an attacker would have to open a PR in `k8s` and seek approval to replace existing images with a malicious image.**\n\n@yashvardhan-kukreja explained that there are 2 flashblocks and 2 coinbase container images that OP engineers have to manually (from their workstations) clone flashblocks github repos, build locally and push to our registries, as these are not built and distributed by flashbots upstream. This manual process provides attack surface in various stages: before the build, during the build, after the build (See  [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.1/threats-overview) taxonomy). For instance:\n- attackers may substitute source that goes in the build before the build happens\n- the `docker` binary on the workstation may be compromised and insert a backdoor at build time\n- a malicious developer may build from a tampered source on purpose\n- a malicious developer may poison an image in the registry previously pushed\n\nWhile this is concerning, this does not worsen our security posture as we already currently do not treat this risk when it comes to all other container images. We can distinguish between:\n1. 1st party images we build in CI\n2. 1st party images we build manually (such as these flashblocks images)\n3. 3rd party images we pull from public registries (traefik, redis...)\n\nOur clusters currently cannot discriminate between these 3 categories. An image built on a workstation is indistinguishable from an image built in CI. There is no trustworthy evidence to make a decision on. The long term solution is provenance based admission control and we plan to work on this in H2. Some build systems can generate cryptographically signed provenance attestations at build time, and attach this evidence to the built images. This attestation for images built in CI captures metadata such as repository of origin, git commit, branch, what CI workflow was executed and on what CI infrastructure (runner, cloud...) the build happened. Signing means that both the provenance and the image cannot be tampered after the build. Only when all our images are built in CI  with this attestation we can then deploy an admission controller that does not allow deployment of images built in circumstances deemed unsafe... For instance we may not allow deployment of images built on workstations in production clusters.\n\nPS: for 3rd party images stored in public registries, there is an additional risk that they become unavailable.

You could even trim that down the specific prestate type you want with `make cannon-prestate-interop`, `make cannon-prestate-mt64` or `make cannon-prestate`. I think you typically want the interop or mt64 versions now given mt64 is going through the release process currently.\n\nNot sure how to fit that build into the kurtosis build process without slowing it all down again but it should be able to use the cached go build artefacts from op-node/op-geth etc and so compile much faster.

I've raised a PR here that addresses some of the snags you raised above: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1230\n\nI'd like to step through each item to provide more colour:\n\n1. During task simulation we intentionally print the markdown with 'TODOs'. During signing this is not printed. The reason we print the markdown is so that the task developer, if required, can easily create the VALIDATION.md files state diff section. I think there are some conversations about only adding state diffs for non-OPCM upgrades. I'd suggest until we have a clear decision here, we should keep printing this markdown during the simulation step. The 'TODOs' are meant to guide the task developer to insert missing details that the signer will want to see when reviewing VALIDATION.md.\n\n2. True, the addition of audit reports to our workflow was experimental and not something we've fully committed to. The language here should be changed. I've added a fix in the PR mentioned above.\n\n3. op-txverify is required for some signers but not for others, I still think we need to land on a solid decision here. cc: @smartcontracts \n\n4. Good call out, added this in the PR above.\n\n5. This is due to the task developer not writing the correct markdown. I've made some helpful changes to the boilerplate markdown file in the PR above.\n\n6. Again, we still do validate state diffs for non-opcm upgrades.

Proxyd being aware of \"block out of range\" error and silently falling back to other backends upon receiving this error.\n3. IP-based sticky sessions: a cache maintaining a time-bounded mapping b/w a client IP and the backend which served its past request (request(1)). Until the time-bound, all the subsequent requests (request (2)) are served by the same backend. After the time-bound, the mapping is cache-invalidated and the client's request goes to some other backend sticking their sessions to it. We already have some IP-based tracking in proxyd so we can re-use that.\n4. Sig-based Sticky sessions: Proxyd returning a tamper-proof and time-bound (JWT-like) signature, containing the serving-backend-details, in the response of request (1). Client can forward this signature as a part of request (2)'s header, and proxyd can decode it and forward to it the relevant backend (the one which served request (1)) and prevent \"block out of range\". \n\nApproach 4 might be the most reliable and prevent bad paths the most, and easy to implement too, but would require client-side changes and publicity which can be a big lift.\n\nApproach 1, 2 and 3 are going to be drop-in fixes which will work out of the box with no client-side changes, just that each one of them have a con of their own:\n- Approch 1's con: The number of eth_call requests forwards becomes N-times (for N-backends). \n- Approach 2's con: Slower response times during sad paths (worst case: N round trips for N backends).\n- Approach 3's con: Implementation will take slightly more time. Can skew the requests of all the clients sitting behind a single forward-proxy to a single backend. Though this \"might\" be a non-issue with the help of XFF headers but we'd have to validate the XFF-header-appending behaviour of Traefik and how proxyd parses that header chain.\n\nIf our eth_call traffic appetite allows, it'd be great to just go with approach 1.\nOtherwise, I'd prefer Approach 2, considering the ease of implementation and rarity of this issue.\n\n\n\n", "2025-11-04T05:13:00Z", "2025-11-04T05:17:51Z", "yashvardhan-kukreja", "2025-11-04 23:24:01"]

This issue could also be present across the other blockchains within the Superchain. For example, node operators usually consult resources like [Running the Node](https://docs.mode.network/tools/node-operators#running-the-node)\n\nA specific case that highlighted the need for improvement occurred in the Discord channel of the developer community. A problem related to running RPC nodes arose, where users encountered the error **\"The block hash and state roots mismatched\"**, which was determined to be linked to pending synchronizations caused by previous updates, such as the **Ecotone Upgrade** and **Fjord Update**.  \n\nAlthough this was resolved by creating a dedicated channel for technical announcements (Tech Announcements), this approach is **manual** and relies on both the team and users actively monitoring communication channels. This presents a challenge, as new users in a blockchain often focus on consuming basic content and do not engage in additional channels, further complicating the process.\n\n\n\n**- Problems we face:**  \nThe current system presents several key challenges:\n- **Manual dependency**: Managing updates depends on people constantly monitoring communication channels and documentation, which is not always efficient.  \n- **Risk of errors**: The lack of automated alerts can lead to desynchronizations, like the problem mentioned earlier.  \n- **Time-consuming support**: Manual review consumes significant resources, making it difficult to prioritize other critical tasks when the team is busy.  \n- **Limited accessibility**: New users face barriers to integrating into these communication flows, which affects their experience in the ecosystem.\n\n\n**- Preferred delivery method:**  \nI believe that a notification system based on **webhooks** would be ideal for our community and ecosystem. This approach offers several advantages:  \n- **Speed**: It would enable direct integration with channels like Discord, Telegram, and X, facilitating real-time information consumption.  \n- **Automation**: It could bring additional improvements to the ecosystem through integrations, automating critical actions such as node updates.  \n- **Flexibility**: Webhooks provide a structured format that can easily adapt to different platforms.  \n\nAs a complement, a secondary option of **email notifications** would be useful for team members who do not frequently use automated systems. This would ensure that all stakeholders are informed, regardless of their level of technical integration.\n\n\n", "2024-12-06T03:24:52Z", "2024-12-06T03:24:52Z", "wolfcito", "2025-11-07 23:23:04"]

["IC_kwDODjvEJM7I1XdQ", "I_kwDODjvEJM7OGG1p", "Yep agreed - we want to remove the state tracking entirely. Whenever a new unsafe payload is received via gossip (with the correct signature), we should send it to the EL via `engine_newPayload` and send it to the EL as the new unsafe payload via `engine_forkChoiceUpdated` (the finalized and safe heads will be unchanged from the last update and the unsafe/latest head is set to this new block).\n\nOne thing to note here is that if the unsafe block does _not_ descend from the safe head, the EL will ultimately find the `engine_forkChoiceUpdated` call to be invalid. It _may_ know that immediately and so return `INVALID` from the `engine_forkChoiceUpdated` call or it may not have the ancestors required to determine it yet and so return `SYNCING`. Later calls to `engine_forkChoiceUpdated` may return `INVALID` once the missing ancestors have been filled in. This can only happen if there's a safe head reorg (very rare but possible) or if the sequencer is misbehaving badly. We avoid this being a problem today because of the code above that checks the unsafe block we're adding builds on the previous unsafe block.\n\nMy suggestion is that if we get `INVALID` in response to `engine_forkChoiceUpdated` when updating the unsafe payload that we do one of:\n1. Reset unsafe head to the last unsafe head we got a `VALID` response for (not `SYNCING`!)\n2. Reset unsafe head back to the current unsafe head according to the EL\n3. Reset unsafe head back to the safe head we're sending\n4. Do a full reset of the derivation pipeline\n\nUltimately the safe head should progress and put us on the same chain as the sequencer and everything will be fine, but the risk with doing a full reset of the pipeline is that a misbehaving sequencer would cause us to constantly reset the pipeline and not make progress advancing safe. Option 1 requires extra tracking so I'd avoid it, but otherwise I'd be tempted to just do 3 and if the unsafe head is already the same as the safe, do a full pipeline reset.\n\nThe one other possibility is that the `INVALID` response to `engine_forkChoiceUpdated` _should_ contain the last valid block hash and we could rollback to that, but there are some cases where the EL can't provide that info so we'd need another strategy in that case anyway and so it's not really worth the extra complexity to try to leverage this info.", "2025-10-05T23:26:57Z", "2025-10-05T23:26:57Z", "ajsutton", "2025-11-13 23:24:56"]

But somewhere in there the cannon-kona game type likely should be added (if we're adding it for all chains)\n* The `migrate` method zeros out the cannon game type implementation - it should also zero out the cannon-kona game type.\n* I don't know what `FetchChainInfo.s.sol` is but assumes there's a \"permissionless\" game which it hard codes to cannon. That's just a broken model - many different game types might be permissionless.\n* `ForkLive.s.sol` has the same incorrect \"permissionless\" game concept", "2025-09-08T00:07:25Z", "2025-09-08T00:07:25Z", "ajsutton", "2025-11-17 23:24:23"]
