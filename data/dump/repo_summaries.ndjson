Discussions continued on several active issues, including fixes for fault proofs with non-genesis interop and improvements to L1 origin validity handling in the op-supervisor.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#1651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1651), was opened to update the data glossary.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed on this day.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened on this day.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Fault Proofs and Interop Challenges\nDiscussions continued on [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16166) regarding the `op-supervisor`'s ability to provide data for fault proofs with non-genesis interop. The core problem is that `op-challenger` doesn't fully support non-Genesis Interop upgrades, leading to invalid actions when proving the non-genesis activation block.\n\n*   **Proposed Solutions:**\n    *   One option is for `op-challenger` to manually construct pre-interop super roots directly from rollup nodes or via the supervisor as a proxy, as there's no risk of unresolved cross-dependencies before interop activation.\n    *   Another option is to start indexing the safe DB in the supervisor from the first random derived block it receives, even if pre-interop, allowing it to serve super roots consistently. This would remove any special meaning of the first block in the safe DB.\n*   **Current Status:** An implementation of the second option is underway. It was also noted that fixing this issue before moving forward with devnets is crucial, as the current code is not viable for the migration process.\n\n### Improving L1 Origin Validity in op-supervisor\nDiscussions on [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16315) focused on improving the `op-supervisor`'s L1 origin validity handling during resets. The current reset logic only checks consistency between local and node safe databases, without verifying if the L1 origin of the found target is canonical.\n\n*   **Key Points:**\n    *   The supervisor should ensure that all provided targets are valid. If a target is invalid, the `op-node` should request another reset from the supervisor, rather than duplicating validity checks or walkbacks.\n    *   This approach would reduce complexity and handle cases where the L1 chain changes during the reset bisection.\n    *   It was noted that pre-interop, some of this functionality was handled by `sync.FindL2Heads`, which did check L1 origin canonicality.\n\n### Incorrect Nonce for Pending Transactions\nIssue [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/623) highlights that `eth_getTransactionCount` returns an incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending transactions, causing transactions to get stuck in the mempool. Users are seeking updates on the resolution of this issue.", "2025-09-04T03:25:44.773Z"]

Discussions on CI stability and `op-node` goroutine issues were prominent, indicating ongoing efforts to enhance system reliability and performance.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, tests added, or other work were completed today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Superstacks Mini App Enhancements\nSeveral issues related to the Superstacks Mini App were closed, including the integration of rank and XP into the claim endpoint [#847](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/847), cleanup of the claim UI [#848](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/848), and setting up a bugbash for the Superstacks claim on the website [#851](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/851).\n\n### Documentation and Analytics Improvements\nAn issue concerning Google Analytics tracking for blog posts on optimism.io was closed [#800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/800). Additionally, a suggestion regarding bridging ERC-20 tokens with Viem in the documentation was closed [#1508](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/1508), with a note that the issue was addressed in a previous PR.\n\n### CI/CD and Testing Improvements\nAn issue related to investigating and improving CI flakiness was closed [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16271), with a summary of improvements made. A spike exploring CI SLAs was also closed [#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16437), with the decision not to implement CI SLAs for now. A feature request to enable deterministic gas testing by setting a fixed base fee was closed [#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/408), as the proposed solution was deemed unnecessary.\n\n### Acceptance Test Porting\nAn issue to port `TestWithdrawalsRoot` to devstack was closed [#412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/412), with a reference to the implementing PR.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Superstacks Mini App Development\nThree new issues were opened related to the Superstacks Mini App: configuring production deployment [#866](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/866), implementing the Mini App UI for the claim flow [#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/867), and implementing the claim contract deployment process [#868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/868).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### CI Flakiness Investigation and Improvement [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16271)\nThe issue was closed today, with `scharissis` providing a final update on the progress made. Key achievements include the release and iteration of a test flake report generator, publicizing the report, and improving test flakiness. The team will continue to monitor flakiness. Earlier comments highlighted the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests and noted that most flakiness was due to infrastructure issues rather than acceptance testing itself.\n\n### `op-node` Goroutine Stuck Issues [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16332)\nRecent comments from `rrrengineer` and `Creamers158` confirm that they are experiencing similar issues with `op-node` v1.13.3, where the node gets stuck with thousands of goroutines, primarily in `select`, `IO wait`, or `yamux` session handlers, leading to sync failures. This indicates a persistent problem with `op-node` stability.\n\n### Spike: CI SLAs [#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16437)\nThe issue was closed today, with `scharissis` deciding not to implement CI SLAs for now. The discussion involved valuable feedback from `pauldowman`, `teddyknox`, and `ajsutton`. Key points raised included concerns about the proposed 5% failure rate being too high, the 1-hour PR feedback time being too long, and the danger of disabling tests. There was a consensus that PR merge time is not a meaningful CI metric. `teddyknox` suggested getting smarter about allowing new tests into the repo to proactively detect flakiness. `ajsutton` expressed skepticism about the necessity of SLAs for developers but acknowledged their potential utility for platforms.", "2025-09-04T03:26:40.401Z"]

This aims to identify which event type causes issues if the overflow recurs. An additional gauge for total in-flight events was also added, with the potential for setting up alerts if a threshold is crossed. Previous discussions debated whether `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` or `\"cross-unsafe-update\"` events were the primary cause of the stacking.\n\n### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet Clarification\nThe discussion around the differences between `supersim` and `interop kurtosis devnet` continued ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/399)). On June 19th, 2025, `zhiqiangxu` inquired about the primary use case for `supersim`, following up on a previous comment that described `supersim` as a lighter wrapper around `anvil` for local development.", "2025-09-04T03:26:27.426Z"]

Additionally, scaffolding for `op-sync-tester` was introduced, including session handling, configuration loading from YAML, and initial boot functionality ([#16780](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16780)). The `cannon` project also saw progress with the migration of more tests to the `DiffTester` framework, enhancing post-step checks ([#16787](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16787)).\n\n### Contract Deployment Assertions Refinement\nSeveral pull requests focused on streamlining and removing redundant assertions within the `contracts-bedrock` deployment scripts. This includes removing unnecessary/duplicate system config assertions ([#16585](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16585)), as well as assertions related to `l1erc721bridge` ([#16716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16716)), dispute game factory ([#16717](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16717)), and optimism mintable erc20 factory ([#16719](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16719)).\n\n### Interoperability and Monitoring Enhancements\nThe `op-e2e` suite was updated to support blob Data Availability (DA) types for the interop supersystem, allowing the batcher to be configured for blob-based data posting ([#16788](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16788)). Furthermore, `dispute-mon` was enhanced to support multiple supervisor RPCs, improving its robustness and reliability ([#16517](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16517)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#16797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16797) OP contracts\n- [#16798](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16798) Remove proxyAdmin input from the OpChainConfig struct\n- [#16801](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16801) op-batcher: separate metrics and logic\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Interoperability and Data Availability\nThe issue concerning configurable DA types for the interop SuperSystem in `op-e2e` was closed ([#15406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15406)). This issue, which aimed to allow the batcher to post batches via blobs instead of calldata, was initially closed incorrectly by automation but then reopened. It has now been resolved by the implementation of blob DA type support.\n\n### Sync Tester Development\nThe issue tracking session handling and middleware for the `op-sync-tester` was closed ([#16699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16699)). This issue focused on enabling the sync tester to maintain stateful information through sessions, initialized via a dedicated endpoint.\n\n### Infrastructure Deployment\nThe issue related to deploying a flashblocks-websocket-proxy in op-sepolia was closed ([#16686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16686)). This deployment aimed to expose flashblocks functionality if all active sequencers in op-sepolia were flashblocks-enabled.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- [#1701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1701) [2024 Q4 Audit] [page-path]\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Code Style and Semgrep Rules\nIssue [#15115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15115), \"Add semgrep rule for private/internal functions,\" remains active. The latest comment from `copilot-swe-agent` indicates an error encountered while attempting to work on the issue, specifically that GitHub Actions is disabled for the repository. The agent requests that the issue be unassigned and then re-assigned after the GitHub Actions issue is resolved.\n\n### Test Target Setup and Teardown\nIssue [#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/375), \"Incorporate test target setup / teardown as an op-acceptor concern,\" is still open. The most recent comment from `teddyknox` (dated 2025-08-21) indicates that the issue is being closed as Kurtosis is no longer considered important for network testing compared to Sysgo. However, a previous comment from `scharissis` (dated 2025-07-23) provided related pull requests, suggesting ongoing work or discussions around this topic.", "2025-09-04T03:28:39.675Z"]
["ethereum-optimism/optimism_day_2025-07-15", "ethereum-optimism/optimism", "day", "2025-07-15", "# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 15, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure by porting several acceptance tests to devstack and introducing a new differential testing framework for Cannon. Significant bug fixes were implemented across `op-service`, `op-batcher`, `kurtosis-devnet`, and `contracts-bedrock`, improving stability and reliability.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure and Stability\nSeveral critical acceptance tests, including ERC20 bridge, withdrawals root, and chain tests, were successfully ported to `op-devstack` for persistent devnets ([#16695](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16695), [#16547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16547), [#16594](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16594)). A new \"DiffTester\" framework was introduced for Cannon, enabling robust differential testing for VM steps and migrating existing noop/unsupported syscall tests ([#16608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16608), [#16707](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16707)).\n\n### Core Component Bug Fixes and Improvements\nKey bug fixes include adding JSON keys to the `OutputV0` type in `op-service` ([#16538](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16538)), removing a duplicate check in `op-batcher` ([#16696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16696)), and fixing a race condition in `op-dispute-mon`'s test suite ([#16697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16697)). The `kurtosis-devnet` now includes retry mechanisms for build and deploy steps to improve resilience ([#16663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16663)).\n\n### Contract and Build System Refinements\nAn edge case in the unused imports check script for `contracts-bedrock` was fixed, preventing incorrect flagging of used imports within string quotes or after comments ([#16693](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16693)). CircleCI images were updated to support Dependabot PRs ([#16676](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16676)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#16698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16698), was opened to fix the `cfg.InitialBond` assignment in the `add-game-type` sub-command within `op-deployer`.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Testing and Development Workflow Improvements\nTwo issues related to the Bailiff bot, concerning emoji reactions when working and providing feedback to first-time users, were closed ([#12684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12684), [#12685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12685)). The `op-batcher` duplicate code issue was resolved ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16677)). The `TestChainFork` port to devstack was completed ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/413)).\n\n### Infrastructure and Deployment Decisions\nDiscussions around the need for NVMe node deployment for `op-rbuilders` were concluded, with a decision to skip it for now due to performance observations and a focus on more immediate issues ([#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16689)). Similarly, the need for dedicated namespacing of `rbuiders` was deprioritized in favor of adding additional labels to alerts and components within the existing sequencer namespace ([#16690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16690)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Sync Tester Development\nSeveral new issues were opened to outline the development of an `op-sync-tester`. This includes session handling and middleware ([#16699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16699)), support for the `eth` namespace ([#16700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16700)) and `engine` namespace ([#16701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16701)), and integration with `sysext` ([#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16704)) and `sysgo` ([#16702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16702)). The goal is to support sync acceptance tests ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16703)) and enable the `op-sync-tester` as a standalone service ([#16705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16705)).\n\n### Validator Enhancements and Migration\nNew issues were created to enhance the `op-validator`, including adding Kurtosis support ([#16712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16712)), automatic startup with `op-acceptor` ([#16711](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16711)), and improved checks for network configurations and contract addresses ([#16713](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16713)). A migration to Blockscout as the block explorer was also proposed ([#16714](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16714)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Flashblocks on Sunnyside Sequencers\nThe issue [#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16688) discusses enabling flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers. The latest comment indicates that all sequencers (voting and non-voting) for Sepolia on Sunnyside are running with Flashblocks and connected to the websocket proxy. Failover has been tested on the `eris-0` devnet. This issue was deprioritized earlier in favor of stabilizing flashblocks on OP Labs Sepolia infrastructure.\n\n### Txpool Invalid Interop Tx Inclusion\nIssue [#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/635) concerns the conditional inclusion of invalid interop transactions in the txpool. Recent comments highlight ongoing investigation into the flakiness observed in CI, where invalid transactions were occasionally included despite ingress filtering. Reproduction efforts have been challenging, with attempts to run tests on repeat not consistently reproducing the issue. The discussion points to a potential deeper problem within `geth`'s transaction handling or filtering logic, as the current analysis suggests no clear path for invalid transactions to bypass filters and enter the mempool. Artifacts from a flaky CI run were provided for further analysis.", "2025-09-04T03:28:08.846Z"]

Significant cleanup and refactoring efforts were also undertaken across various components.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Data Availability Throttling for `op-batcher`\nThe `op-batcher` received a significant upgrade with the introduction of advanced throttling control mechanisms for Data Availability (DA). This enhancement expands beyond previous capabilities, offering multiple strategies for more robust and flexible DA management.\n- Enhanced DA Throttling with multiple control mechanisms ([#16588](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16588))\n\n### Infrastructure and Testing Improvements\nKey improvements were made to development infrastructure and testing frameworks, including a fix for `kurtosis-devnet` to support non-template network descriptions and the migration of `cannon` fault tests to a new framework.\n- Support for non-template network descriptions in `kurtosis-devnet` ([#16769](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16769))\n- Migration of `cannon` fault tests to `DiffTester` framework ([#16767](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16767))\n\n### Codebase Refinements and Cleanup\nSeveral refactoring and cleanup tasks were completed, streamlining deployment checks for various contracts and removing outdated `TODO` comments from the codebase. Unnecessary assertions related to `l1standardbridge` were also removed.\n- Cleanup of deploy checks for multiple contracts ([#16749](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16749))\n- Removal of unnecessary `l1standardbridge` assertions ([#16715](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16715))\n- Removal of outdated `TODO` comments ([#16775](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16775))\n- `op-devstack` now tolerates absence of conductors ([#16776](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16776))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#16774](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16774) feat(op-acceptance-tests): build cache.\n- [#16781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16781) Rename TestERC721 Contract to L2ERC721Bridge_TestERC721_Harness.\n- [#16782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16782) Update Encoding.t.sol: Rename Test Harness for Clarity.\n- [#16789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16789) fix(op-batcher): accurate pending DA metrics.\n- [#16791](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16791) Supervisor Fuzzing.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Fault Proof Runbook Finalization\nThe final review of the Fault Proof Incident Runbook v3 was completed, and the \"draft\" label was removed. This involved updating references from other runbooks and renaming versions to clearly indicate which upgrade versions they cover. ([#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16651))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### `op-sync-tester` Enhancements\nA new issue was opened to support the `sync` namespace in `op-sync-tester`. This includes adding `sync_getSession` for monitoring session status and `sync_delete` for managing sessions. ([#16778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16778))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Configurable DA Type for `op-e2e` Interop SuperSystem\nDiscussion continues on making the Data Availability (DA) type configurable for the `op-e2e` interop `SuperSystem` ([#15406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15406)). The issue was briefly closed incorrectly due to automation but has since been reopened. While the current `SuperSystem` uses calldata for batch posting, there's a desire for blob posting, especially for interop Fault Proof (FP) testing. There's an ongoing debate about whether this is a blocker for RC Beta, with some suggesting that existing blob preimage tests provide sufficient coverage and that the `SuperSystem` itself might be deprecated in favor of `op-devstack`. The consensus is that this needs to be addressed before removing pre-interop FP support, but it doesn't necessarily block immediate interop shipping.", "2025-09-04T03:28:35.253Z"]

Key updates include enhanced visibility for batcher throttling and a fix for the OPCM test suite.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Batcher Throttling and Data Handling Improvements\nThe `op-batcher` received significant updates to its throttling mechanism. A new feature ([#16804](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16804)) makes the maximum throttle threshold more visible in logs and API, improving operational transparency. Additionally, the batcher was updated to always use blobs while throttling ([#16773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16773)), preventing unintended fallback to calldata during periods of high data backlog.\n\n### Contract Assertion Cleanup and Test Fixes\nEfforts were made to clean up assertions across various Bedrock contracts, including the Optimism Portal, OPCM, ASR, and EthLockbox ([#16819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16819)). This refactoring aims to improve code clarity and maintainability. A specific bug fix was also implemented for the OPCM test suite ([#16813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16813)), ensuring its reliability.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Batcher Throttling Behavior Resolved\nThe issue concerning the `op-batcher` preventing auto-DA switching to calldata if throttling is activated ([#16691](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16691)) has been closed. This indicates that the batcher's behavior during throttling, specifically its preference for blobs, has been successfully addressed.\n\n### Supervisor and Node Reset Logic\nThe issue related to improving the reset unsafe target logic in `op-supervisor` and `op-node` ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16314)) has been closed. The latest comment indicates that the issue is being closed due to recent project changes, with a suggestion to re-open or create a new issue if necessary. Previous discussions highlighted partial implementation and remaining considerations for pre- and post-Interop handling.\n\n### Logger Utility Refinement\nThe issue regarding a more reusable logger utility to change the log-level of sub-loggers in `op-service` ([#15139](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15139)) has been closed. The resolution points to the existing mechanism for adjusting log levels based on context data via the log handler method, which is already supported by devstack.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### OPCM Test Suite Failure Investigation\nA new issue has been opened to investigate why the `OPContractsManager_Upgrade_Test::test_verifyOpcmCorrectness_succeeds()` test fails specifically on the OP Mainnet upgrade test but not on other fork tests ([#16823](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16823)).\n\n### Geth v1.16.1 Merge Completion\nA new issue has been created to track the completion of the Geth v1.16.1 merge ([#16825](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16825)).

Key updates include an `op-sync-tester` refactor and a CI fix.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Testing Infrastructure Enhancements\nThe `op-sync-tester` was significantly refactored to implement the `L2ELNode` interface, simplifying network setup for testing. This change streamlines the integration of the sync tester with other components like `op-geth` and `op-reth`. ([#17200](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17200))\n\n### CI/CD and Tooling Improvements\nA critical CI issue was resolved by removing a problematic \"Todo\" that was causing build failures. Additionally, documentation for `op-deployer` was updated to correct an outdated link, and basic CLI argument handling was added to `op-up`. ([#17229](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17229), [#17204](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17204), [#17208](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17208))\n\n### Contract Reversions and CI Stability\nA previous change related to FDG legibility was reverted in the U16a proposal branch. Furthermore, a CI adjustment was made to write cannon preimage commit information to a temporary file before uploading, aiming to improve `gsutil cp` retries and reduce flakiness. ([#17209](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17209), [#17219](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17219))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nThree new pull requests were opened today:\n- [#17221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17221): Focuses on fixing typos within the codebase.\n- [#17222](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17222): Introduces a feature to enable flashblocks tests within the Kurtosis devnet.\n- [#17227](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17227): Proposes removing the super root migration from the portal as part of the U16a update.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Testing and Development Tooling\nThe issue of supporting `sysgo` within `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` was closed, indicating progress in integrating these components for testing. Additionally, the `op-up` tool now recognizes and responds to standard CLI flags, improving its usability. ([#16702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16702), [#17076](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17076))\n\n### Challenger Support in `op-up`\nThe issue concerning `op-up`'s support for the challenger was closed. A comment noted that distributing the challenger in `op-up` for `sysgo` use might be too complex, suggesting a focus on other backends like Docker that don't require binary distribution. ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17005))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Core Protocol Development\nA new issue was opened to track the completion of the Geth v1.16.2 merge, indicating ongoing efforts to update core dependencies. ([#17223](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17223))\n\n### Security and Auditing\nA new issue was created to resolve an ImmuneFi divergence report, highlighting a focus on addressing security findings. ([#17224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17224))\n\n### Developer Experience and Tooling\nTwo new issues were opened to enhance developer experience: one to define a configuration schema for `op-up` and another to improve the CircleCI config for job dependency references, making CI setup more intuitive. ([#17225](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17225), [#17226](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17226))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### `op-proposer` Transaction Failures ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13502))\nThe latest comment confirms that setting `--game-type=1` fixed the \"Failed to create a transaction\" error for a user, suggesting that misconfiguration of the game type is a common cause. Previous discussions highlighted that the error often relates to `NoImplementation` due to misconfigured contracts or an incorrect `game-type` for `op-proposer`.\n\n### Sync Testing with `op-sync-tester` ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16703))\nThe issue was reopened as not all Hardfork (HF) transitions were tested. New test case ideas include checking every OP Stack HF transition (not just Isthmus), testing multiple CLs with a single Sync Tester, and validating user transactions within L2 blocks. Items 2 and 3 are being tracked in a separate issue.\n\n### Flashblocks Load Testing ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16756))\nA comment from today indicates that the issue was accidentally marked as done and that a report summarizing the load test scenarios, networks, and results is currently being worked on.\n\n### Flashblocks Alerting ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16867), [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16868))\nFor [#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16867) (alert when non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active), a PR for `rollup-boost` is pending, after which the alert will be created. For [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16868) (alert on low peer count health), it was noted that peer count alerting for `op-node` sequencer peering already exists. The plan is to add `reth`/`op-rbuilder` peer count for this specific alert.", "2025-09-04T03:30:02.299Z"]

Several new issues were opened to track the integration of Kona and Cannon for fault proofs.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Devstack and Challenger Enhancements\nThe `op-devstack` now supports the `kona-supervisor` within its `sysgo` orchestrator, enabling its launch as part of the devstack system ([#17195](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17195)). Additionally, the `op-devstack` was improved to verify contract deployment transactions are actually included, preventing race conditions ([#17232](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17232)). The `op-challenger` gained an option to restrict the frequency of update cycles, reducing L1 node calls ([#17233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17233)).\n\n### Program and Sync Tester Improvements\nA bug in `op-program` related to the length check for pending progress during the consolidate step was fixed ([#17220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17220)). The `op-sync-tester` received significant updates, adding Verifier Engine APIs (`engine_newPayloadV1`, `engine_getPayloadV1`, `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1`, etc.) to support Bedrock, Canyon, and Delta hardforks ([#17234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17234)).\n\n### Testing and CI Updates\nUnit tests were added for `op-up` ([#17210](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17210)). The CI configuration was updated to run the same jobs on the `proposal/op-contracts/v4.1.0` branch as on `develop` ([#17211](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17211)). Cannon baseline files were updated to align with the geth 1.16.2 upgrade ([#17230](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17230)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **Feature Development**: New features include a CLI wrapper for Forge binary execution ([#17235](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17235)) and an interop portal ([#17247](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17247)).\n- **Bug Fixes**: A fix for the `sync-tester` to correct the PayloadV4 version check in `GetPayloadV4` was opened ([#17236](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17236)).\n- **Testing and Infrastructure**: A pull request to add edge case tests for `Blueprint.bytesToUint` function was opened ([#17240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17240)). There's also a new PR to introduce `BlockBuilder` in the `op-node` engine package ([#17241](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17241)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Fault Proof System Enhancements\nThe tracking issue for the Interop proofs U17 proof upgrade workstream has been closed ([#15980](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15980)). This indicates progress in the ongoing efforts to improve the fault proof system.\n\n### Testing Infrastructure Improvements\nSupport for flashblocks in Kurtosis, a key component for testing, has been addressed and the issue closed ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16514)). However, a comment notes this task is currently deprioritized and will not be fully implemented as initially planned, with tests mostly done but two PRs needing cleanup.\n\n### Challenger and Program Stability\nAn issue providing an option to limit how often games are processed by `op-challenger` has been closed ([#13090](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13090)), which should reduce L1 node calls. A bug regarding an invalid pending progress length check in `op-program`'s state transition has also been resolved ([#15217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15217)).\n\n### Sync Tester Engine Support\nThe issue tracking the `op-sync-tester`'s support for the engine namespace, including methods like `engine_newPayload` and `engine_forkchoiceUpdated`, has been closed ([#16701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16701)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Kona + Cannon Integration\nSeveral new issues were opened to track the integration of Kona and Cannon as a fallback proof option:\n- Main tracking issue for shipping Kona + Cannon as a fallback fault proof ([#17237](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17237)).\n- Adding Kona + Cannon to `vm-runner` for testing with real mainnet blocks ([#17238](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17238)).\n- Integrating Kona + Cannon into `op-challenger`, including adding a `cannon-kona` trace type ([#17239](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17239)).\n\n### Protocol Stability and Testing\nNew issues address critical aspects of protocol stability and testing:\n- Edits for the U17 governance proposal related to proofs ([#17244](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17244)).\n- Investigating `op-node` instability triggered by L1 RPC delays, particularly when L1 RPC is slow ([#17245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17245)).\n- Enabling flashblock tests against persistent devnets in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17248)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Forge Deployer Migration\nDiscussions continue on the migration of OP Deployer to use Forge.\n- **[Forge Deployer] Create CLI wrapper around Forge binary** ([#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17214)): `tooshiNoko` expressed interest in taking this task.\n- **[Tracking] [Forge Deployer] OP Deployer Forge Migration** ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17213)): `tooshiNoko` noted that they submitted [#17235](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17235) and suggested syncing up with `bitwiseguy` to avoid overlapping work, also expressing a desire to take on all related tasks.\n- **[Forge Deployer] Convert DeploySuperchain to use Forge** ([#17215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17215)): `tooshiNoko` asked if they could take this task.\n- **[Forge Deployer] Convert DeployImplementations to use Forge** ([#17216](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17216)): `tooshiNoko` asked if they could take this task.\n- **[Forge Deployer] Convert DeployOPChain to use Forge** ([#17217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17217)): `tooshiNoko` asked if they could take this task.\n- **[Forge Deployer] Convert contract verification logic to use Forge** ([#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17218)): `tooshiNoko` asked if they could take this task.\n\nThe common theme across these issues is `tooshiNoko`'s active engagement and interest in leading the Forge migration efforts.", "2025-09-04T03:30:10.381Z"]

The latest comment from Stevmark11 confirms that the necessary gate is in place and the primary task is to ensure correct functionality, indicating a straightforward implementation.\n\n### CI for `op-geth` PRs\nIssue [#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/665) addresses the need for monorepo CI to run on `op-geth` PRs to catch breaking changes early. Ajsutton proposed \"Option C\": a periodic job in the monorepo to check for the latest `op-geth` commit from the optimism branch, notifying via Slack if it fails. This approach aims to quickly alert to issues, though it might produce false alarms if the job runs between `op-geth` and monorepo PR merges.\n\n### Documentation for `op-deployer`\nIssue [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1530) focuses on creating an example for deploying an OP Stack Rollup testnet using `op-deployer`.

The proposed alternative involves a centralized driver where the sequencer leader publishes the latest unsafe block via Redis, and other nodes subscribe and inject it via `admin_postUnsafePayload`. On restarts, a sidecar checks sync status against the sequencer leader and fetches blocks from the EL. This method is complementary and does not replace P2P entirely.\n\n### Min-Base-Fee Specification ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/742))\nThis issue was closed as the specification for `min-base-fee` has been completed and merged via [#747](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/747). Previously, there was a discussion about computing a rough estimate for the state growth implied by this feature, which was later decided to be better placed in the FMA and tracked in a separate design-docs issue.", "2025-09-04T03:30:22.574Z"]

Overall, the period reflects a phase of proactive maintenance, optimization, and groundwork for future development.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWhile no pull requests were merged this week, significant new work was proposed across several key areas:\n\n-   **Performance and Optimization:** Several new initiatives aim to improve efficiency. Proposals include using `bytes.Buffer` in `op-service` ([#16964](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16964)), preallocating resources in `op-challenger` ([#16978](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16978)), and optimizing the Kurtosis devnet with preallocated slices ([#16990](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16990)). A spike was also started to analyze the calldata footprint cost ([#16970](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16970)).\n\n-   **`op-batcher` Enhancements:** Work began on improving the robustness and observability of the `op-batcher`. One PR introduces a metric to track channel closure reasons ([#16984](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16984)), while another aims to make the AltDA `SetInput` function more resilient through per-request context and backoff mechanisms ([#16985](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16985)).\n\n-   **Tooling and Code Refinements:** Efforts to refine development tools and code correctness were initiated. A fix was proposed for L1 validator wallet generation to ensure it correctly uses the `Count` field from `mnemonics.yaml` ([#16953](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16953)). Another PR addresses an issue with method name translation to ensure accuracy when parameters differ ([#16974](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16974)).\n\n-   **Dependency Management:** Routine dependency maintenance continued with several automated pull requests to update Go modules, including `go-multiaddr` ([#16980](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16980]), `go-connections` ([#16982](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16982]), `golang.org/x/mod` ([#16983](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16983]), and `w3` ([#16989](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16989)).\n\n-   **Documentation:** A minor fix for the documentation's Table of Contents was proposed in PR [#16956](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16956).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   A long-standing developer tooling issue ([#49](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/49)) concerning direct vs. transitive dependencies was closed, marking progress in improving the developer experience.\n    -   An issue raised by a community member regarding a project being inappropriately flagged for OP allocation ([#72](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/72)) was swiftly investigated and resolved by the team.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   No significant new issues were opened this week, apart from the quickly resolved allocation issue mentioned above.\n    -   An older documentation issue ([#1675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1675)) saw unusual activity, with a user posting the same wallet address multiple times in the comments. The purpose of these comments is unclear from the provided data.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe week highlighted a positive feedback loop between the project and its community. In issue [#72](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/72), a user (\"sexychinese\") reported a problem with the OP allocation process, and team member \"ccerv1\" acknowledged and confirmed its resolution within the same day. This interaction demonstrates the team's commitment to addressing community concerns promptly. Otherwise, development activity was primarily driven by core contributors and automated dependency updates, with no other significant collaborative discussions noted in the reports.", "2025-09-04T03:38:45.149Z"]

The alternative aims to improve this.\n- **Complementary Approach:** The proposed alternative is complementary to P2P, allowing for multiple \"drivers\" to gossip blocks.\n- **Centralized Driver Mechanism:** One proposed driver involves the sequencer leader publishing the latest unsafe block via Redis, with other nodes subscribing and injecting payloads via `admin_postUnsafePayload`.

This creates a bottleneck, limiting the number of chains that can be upgraded in a single transaction. An updated design document ([design-docs/pull/275](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/275)) reflects the latest direction for this refactoring effort, which aims to remove these immutables and allow for shared contract implementations across chains.\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month highlighted a key area for future development focused on protocol efficiency and scalability.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed in the provided data.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** The most significant activity revolved around issue **[#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421)**, which was opened to track the refactoring of fault proof contracts. Discussion on this issue emphasized its importance for the Superchain's upgrade process. The high deployment cost of the current contracts is a major impediment to scaling. This issue, previously paused, has been re-prioritized as it represents a critical path for improving the efficiency of managing a growing number of chains within the Superchain.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was characterized by strategic planning and technical design discussions.

The `op-challenger` currently struggles with non-genesis activation blocks. One proposed solution involves the `op-challenger` manually constructing pre-interop super roots from rollup nodes or via the supervisor. Another option, currently being implemented, suggests indexing the safe DB in the supervisor from the first derived block, even if pre-Interop, to serve super roots consistently.

The core problem is that `op-challenger` currently doesn't fully support non-genesis interop upgrades, leading to invalid actions when proving the non-genesis activation block. A key point of discussion is whether the `op-challenger` should manually construct the root from rollup nodes or if the `op-supervisor` should handle this by indexing the safe DB from the first derived block it receives, even if pre-Interop. The latest comment suggests that allowing the `op-supervisor` to index pre-Interop data would also enable the removal of `op-node`'s safe DB for managed nodes.

This issue highlights that the supervisor's reset logic currently lacks checks for the canonical L1 origin of the target, potentially leading to inconsistencies. The discussion suggests that after bisecting to a common safe block, the L1 origin of the found reset target should be verified, and if not canonical, the safe chain should be walked back until a valid L1 origin is found.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Fault Proofs with Non-Genesis Interop\nDiscussions on [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16166) \"op-supervisor: Fix ability to provide data for fault proofs with non-genesis interop\" continued.

The current reset logic only checks consistency between local and node safe databases, lacking a check for the canonical nature of the L1 origin. This could lead to issues if the L1 chain changes during a reset. ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16315))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### op-supervisor: Fix ability to provide data for fault proofs with non-genesis interop ([#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16166))\nDiscussion continues on how to enable `op-supervisor` to provide data for fault proofs with non-genesis interop. The core problem is that `op-challenger` doesn't fully support non-Genesis Interop upgrades, leading to issues when proving the non-genesis activation block. Recent comments suggest two main options:\n1.  **Challenger-side construction:** The `op-challenger` could manually construct the required data from rollup nodes or via the supervisor as a proxy, similar to how output roots are handled. This would avoid reliance on the supervisor's database for pre-interop data.\n2.  **Supervisor indexing:** The `op-supervisor` could start indexing its safe database from the first derived block it receives, even if pre-Interop, allowing it to serve super roots consistently. This would remove any special meaning of the first block in the safe database.\n\nThere's a consensus that fixing this before moving forward with devnets is crucial, as the current code isn't viable for the migration process. It was also noted that fixing this in the `op-supervisor` is preferred, as the `op-challenger` lacks the necessary information.\n\n### eth_getTransactionCount returns incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending txs ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/623))\nThis issue, concerning an incorrect nonce returned by `eth_getTransactionCount` on the Base node, remains active.

Multiple new issues were reported, including critical `op-node` goroutine issues and `op-supervisor` event overflow concerns. Discussions continued on existing issues related to CI flakiness, L1 origin handling in `op-supervisor`, and `eth_getTransactionCount` nonce discrepancies.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo completed work was reported for this day.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nFour new pull requests were opened today:\n- **Deployment and Configuration:** A PR was opened to validate intent overrides within the `op-deployer` component ([#16338](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16338)).\n- **Development Process Improvements:** An initial PR review policy was proposed ([#16339](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16339)).\n- **Dispute Game Enhancements:** A new feature for a CWIA dispute game creator pattern was introduced ([#16340](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16340)).\n- **Testing Infrastructure:** Small improvements to existing tests were submitted ([#16342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16342)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- **Documentation Updates:** The issue regarding the `L2OutputOracleProxy` not being deployed and `op-deployer` startup failures was closed ([#1614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1614)). The resolution indicated that the L2 Output Oracle is deprecated and the related testnet tutorial is outdated.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- **Node Stability and Performance:** A critical issue was reported for `op-node` v1.13.3, where thousands of goroutines become stuck in `p2p.SyncClient` and `libp2p` after several hours of uptime, leading to sync failures ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16332)).\n- **Supervisor Event Handling:** An issue was opened concerning the `op-supervisor` entering a non-recoverable crash-loop due to event overflow when the unsafe head gap between its log DB and a managed node becomes too large ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16335)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n- **CI Flakiness Investigation:** Discussions continued on investigating and improving CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16271)). A comment from June 9th highlighted the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests, with `TestSequencingWindowExpiry` and `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` being the most frequent offenders. It was also noted that much of the flakiness is due to infrastructure issues rather than acceptance testing itself.\n- **Supervisor L1 Origin Handling:** The issue concerning improving L1 origin validity handling during `op-supervisor` resets saw a comment on June 9th, suggesting that instead of performing walkbacks, all targets provided by the supervisor should be inherently valid. If a target is invalid, the supervisor should realize the L1 chain has changed and provide a new reset, reducing complexity ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16315)).\n- **Incorrect Nonce from `eth_getTransactionCount`:** The issue where `eth_getTransactionCount` returns an incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending transactions was commented on June 9th, with a user asking for an update ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/623)).\n- **Superchain Interop Environment Quickstart Guide:** Discussions on creating a quickstart guide for the Superchain Interop environment continued ([#1644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1644)). On June 9th, it was suggested that this content would be suitable for a homepage, and a wider lens for its scope would be explored. A draft is expected by June 10th.\n- **Complete Withdrawal Flow Test:** Progress was reported on the complete withdrawal flow test ([#327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/327)). On June 9th, it was confirmed that the (sysgo) implementation is complete via [#16333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16333), with two follow-up tickets needed for kt (sysext) support and a devnet-specific withdrawal execution without proof.", "2025-09-04T03:25:54.217Z"]

A comment from `ajsutton` on June 17th, 2025, argued against adding this validation to the execution client, stating that the genesis generation tooling (`op-deployer`) already sufficiently mitigates the risk of incorrect configurations. The tooling automatically determines if `CrossL2Inbox` should be included based on the presence of multiple chains, ensuring that only the correct genesis is generated.\n\n### Release Pipeline Automation\nIssue [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16097), concerning the use of GoReleaser for `op-node`/`batcher`/`proposer`/`challenger` release pipelines, saw a new comment from `geoknee` on June 17th, 2025. The comment suggested a lighter-weight solution for changelog generation using `git cliff`, providing a command example for `op-node` and `op-service` components. This indicates an ongoing effort to streamline and automate the release process, particularly for generating accurate release notes.\n\n### `op-node` Stability and Goroutine Issues\nThe issue [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16332), reporting thousands of stuck goroutines in `op-node` v1.13.3's p2p.SyncClient, received a new comment from `Creamers158` on June 17th, 2025. The comment confirmed experiencing the same issue with `op-node` v1.13.3 and provided a detailed stack trace, highlighting `select`, `IO wait`, and `yamux` related goroutines.

Discussions continued on improving release pipelines, addressing `op-node` goroutine issues, and refining supervisor event handling.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Transaction Management Enhancements**: A new feature was added to the transaction manager and batcher, allowing for the rebroadcasting of signed transactions without increasing gas fees. This improves the flexibility and efficiency of transaction handling. ([#16310](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16310))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   **Supervisor Event Handling**: A pull request was opened to add a `byType sync.Map` to `op-node/rollup/event`, likely to improve event processing and debugging within the supervisor. ([#16471](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16471))\n*   **Documentation Cleanup**: A pull request was submitted to remove a broken image link from the README, improving the repository's documentation quality. ([#16475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16475))\n*   **CI/CD Improvements**: A pull request was opened to cache Rust installations in the CI pipeline using `mise`, aiming to speed up build times. ([#16480](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16480))\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n*   **Flashblocks Enablement**: The issue concerning the enablement of flashblocks on `eris-0` for testing in a non-interop environment was closed, with a detailed breakdown of the completed phases and associated PRs across `optimism-charts`, `devnets`, and `k8s` repositories. ([#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16468))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n*   **Super DA Error Codes**: A new issue was opened to add missing error codes for data availability errors caused by reorgs, specifically those currently absent from the Go implementation in the specification. ([#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/725))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n*   **Interop EL Prestate Check**: Discussion continued on the issue of checking the EL prestate for pre-interop `CrossL2Inbox` configuration faults. The latest comment suggests that the execution client is not well-suited for this validation, and the risk has been mitigated through improvements in the genesis generation tooling (`op-deployer`), which now correctly determines the inclusion of `CrossL2Inbox` based on the number of chains. ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15765))\n*   **GoReleaser for OP Stack Components**: The discussion around using GoReleaser for `op-node/batcher/proposer/challenger` release pipelines saw a new comment suggesting a lighter-weight solution for changelog generation using `git cliff`. The goal is to automate release notes and streamline the release process. ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16097))\n*   **op-node Stuck Goroutines**: Users continue to report issues with `op-node` (v1.13.3) getting stuck with thousands of goroutines, primarily in `select`, `IO wait`, or `yamux` session handlers, leading to sync problems. This indicates an ongoing stability concern for the `op-node`. ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16332))\n*   **op-supervisor Event Overflow**: The issue of the `op-supervisor` crashing due to event overflow when the unsafe head gap is too large is being actively investigated. There's a debate on whether `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` or `\"cross-unsafe-update\"` events are the primary culprits. A PR has been proposed to add a counter per event type to aid in debugging future occurrences. ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16335))\n*   **Persistent Devnets Acceptance Tests**: Progress was noted on getting all acceptance tests running and passing in persistent devnets, with a recent addition of L1 Faucet support. This indicates ongoing efforts to improve the testing infrastructure. ([#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/398))\n*   **Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet**: The discussion clarified the difference between `supersim` and `interop kurtosis devnet`. `supersim` is described as a lighter-weight wrapper around Anvil for local development and testing of multichain/interop applications, while Kurtosis is used for the underlying OP Stack chain testing.

A user reported experiencing the same issue on v1.13.3.\n\n### `op-supervisor` Event Overflow\nComments on [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16335) focused on the `op-supervisor` crashing due to event overflow when the unsafe head gap is too large. Discussions revolved around identifying the culprit event type, with `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` initially suspected but later clarified as unlikely to stack up. A PR ([#16473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16473)) was added to introduce a gauge for in-flight events to aid future debugging, and another ([#16471](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16471)) to add a counter per event type.\n\n### Release Pipeline Automation\nIssue [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16097) saw further discussion on using GoReleaser for `op-node`/`batcher`/`proposer`/`challenger` release pipelines. A lighter-weight solution for changelog generation using `git-cliff` was documented, with a focus on automating release notes. The broader goal is a one-click solution for consistent, high-quality changelogs.\n\n### Interop Configuration Validation\nDiscussion on [#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15765) centered on the difficulty of validating `CrossL2Inbox` configuration in the EL prestate from the execution client's perspective. It was argued that the genesis generation tooling (`op-deployer`) already handles this correctly, making client-side validation less critical and potentially overly complex.\n\n### Devnet Testing and L1 Faucet Support\nOn [#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/398), progress was noted on getting acceptance tests running in persistent devnets. A PR ([#16423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16423)) was added to support L1 Faucet functionality.\n\n### Super DA Error Codes\nIssue [#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/725) was opened to address missing error codes for data availability errors caused by reorgs in the Go implementation, which are currently absent from the spec.\n\n### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet\nDiscussion on [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/399) clarified that Supersim is a lighter-weight local development tool built around Anvil, primarily for testing multichain/interop applications and upcoming features, while Kurtosis is used for chain testing within the OP Stack.", "2025-09-04T03:26:24.319Z"]

Another issue notes that in `op-acceptance-tests` load tests, onchain balance sometimes depletes before the offchain budget ([#16536](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16536)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### `op-batcher` Memory Optimization\nDiscussion on [#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16537) (spike(op-batcher): optimize memory consumption) continued with `geoknee` providing detailed steps for running `pprof` to identify memory usage, specifically pointing to the compressor as the main culprit. `geoknee` also suggested two optimizations: making the shadow compressor use half the memory and eagerly discarding the compressor after channel submission. `sebastianst` initially suggested using a memory profiler.\n\n### `op-node` Trivial-Interop Mode\nOn [#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16519) (op-node: Trivial-interop mode without supervisor), `sebastianst` clarified that the goal is to prevent churn for chain operators by allowing them to run `op-node` without a supervisor for trivial depsets, even before interop merging is fully implemented. `Inphi` questioned the necessity of this, suggesting that the upgrade path to merging 1-depset chains with an existing interop cluster might be more complicated if they are not already driven by a supervisor.\n\n### Redundant Assertions in StandardValidator\nOn [#16362](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16362) (Remove redundant assertions outside of the StandardValidator), `AmadiMichael` outlined a two-phase plan: first, removing redundant checks from deploy scripts that already exist in `ChainAssertions.sol`, and second, moving checks from `ChainAssertions.sol` to the `StandardValidator`. They also noted the potential for codesize limits and suggested moving some checks to a child contract if exceeded.", "2025-09-04T03:26:37.664Z"]

Two new issues were opened, one concerning Uniswap V4 deployment and another addressing chain ID data types.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Core Protocol Enhancements\nA new issue, [#410](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/410), was opened to address a technical inconsistency where dependency set chain IDs are currently cast as `uint64` in Supersim, which is not compliant with the `uint256` specification.\n### Ecosystem Integration\nAnother new issue, [#409](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/409), was created to include Uniswap V4 deployment within Supersim, indicating a focus on expanding the simulated environment's capabilities.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### `op-batcher` Memory Optimization\nDiscussion on [#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16537) (spike(op-batcher): optimize memory consumption) continued with `geoknee` providing a detailed recipe for using `pprof` to identify memory bottlenecks. Initial findings suggest the compressor is the primary source of memory usage when a backlog of channels occurs. `geoknee` proposed two optimizations: making the shadow compressor use half the memory and more eagerly discarding the compressor after channel submission. `sebastianst` suggested exploring the use of a single, shared compressor to further save memory.\n\n### `op-node` Trivial Interop Mode\nOn [#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16519) (op-node: Trivial-interop mode without supervisor), `sebastianst` clarified that allowing trivial interop without a supervisor aims to prevent churn for chain operators who only have a trivial dependency set, especially in the coming months before interop merging is fully implemented. This approach allows them to start running a supervisor weeks before an actual merge, simplifying future transitions.\n\n### Redundant Assertion Removal\nRegarding [#16362](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16362) (Remove redundant assertions outside of the StandardValidator), `AmadiMichael` outlined a two-phase approach for refactoring. The first phase involves removing checks from `Deploy*.s.sol` scripts that are already present in `ChainAssertions.sol`. The second phase will move checks from `ChainAssertions.sol` to the `StandardValidator`, with a plan to use a child contract if codesize limits are exceeded.", "2025-09-04T03:26:37.887Z"]

This involved ensuring templates check against `StandardValidator` contracts ([#838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/838)), making prevalidations possible regardless of address registry availability ([#654](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/654)), and checking domain hash from simulation against `VALIDATIONS.md` entries ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/679)).\n\n### Refactoring and UX Improvements\nRefactoring efforts and user experience enhancements were finalized. This includes addressing the `StateOverrideManager` always adding nonce as a state override ([#814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/814)), providing a simple UX for users to override Nonces ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/770)), and improving the granularity of `addresses.json` checking ([#753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/753)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### `op-deployer` and Acceptance Test Queries\nNew issues have been opened concerning the `op-deployer` and acceptance tests. One question asks why `ChainState.ID` is a hash in `op-deployer` ([#16586](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16586)), while another proposes using block times for waits/timeouts instead of hardcoded values in acceptance tests ([#16598](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16598)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### GoReleaser for OP Stack Release Pipeline ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16097))\nDiscussion continues on using GoReleaser for the `op-node/batcher/proposer/challenger` release pipeline. A recent comment suggests wiring up `op-workbench` to automatically execute `git cliff` commands for generating release notes and pushing them to GitHub, aiming for a one-click solution for high-quality changelogs. Previous comments highlighted the need to consolidate build systems (docker bake, makefiles, justfiles) into a single, consistent approach before adopting GoReleaser to avoid further bloat and inconsistencies. The `op-deployer`'s current GoReleaser setup is noted as not being a good example due to existing inconsistencies.\n\n### Abnormal CPU Usage with Latest `op-geth` ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/613))\nThe issue of abnormal CPU usage with `op-geth` v1.101511.0 is still active. A user shared a `pprof` file, noting that the performance issue was due to an index update that took about 24 hours. Another user provided detailed instructions on how to capture `pprof` metrics, suggesting that the high CPU usage might be temporary due to log indexing rebuilds in the backported go-ethereum v1.15.11. There's a concern that the problem persists even after index upgrades, indicating a potential bug.\n\n### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/399))\nThe distinction between Supersim and Interop Kurtosis Devnet is being clarified. It was explained that Supersim is a local tool for testing multichain/interop applications, acting as a wrapper around Anvil, and is lighter for local development. It's used by applications planning to launch when interop is live on mainnet. A recent question asks if Supersim is mainly for testing dapps rather than chains, which Kurtosis handles.", "2025-09-04T03:27:11.483Z"]

Significant progress was also made on integrating the Standard Validator into OPCM, alongside updates to documentation and testing infrastructure.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Protocol Stability and Reliability\nCritical bug fixes were implemented to improve the stability of core Optimism components. The `op-node` received a fix to ensure proper mutex unlocking ([#16617](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16617)), preventing potential deadlocks. Similarly, the `op-supervisor` was updated to remove redundant locks and resolve a deadlock issue ([#16642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16642)), addressing previously reported event overflow and congestion problems.\n\n### OPCM and Standard Validator Integration\nSignificant work was completed on integrating the Standard Validator into the Optimism Contracts Manager (OPCM) ([#16237](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16237)). This integration aligns the Standard Validator with existing OPCM patterns, enhancing the modularity and maintainability of the contract system.\n\n### Developer Tooling and Documentation Improvements\nDocumentation for the Smart Contract Style Guide was updated to reflect new test conventions and validation workflows ([#16614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16614)), providing clearer guidelines for developers. Additionally, new log formats (`logfmtms` and `jsonms`) were added to `op-service` ([#16645](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16645)), improving logging capabilities for debugging and monitoring.\n\n### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure\nThe `op-acceptance-tests` received an update to unify stopping conditions for interop load tests ([#16640](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16640)). This change streamlines testing procedures by ensuring consistent budget depletion or timeout conditions across different test schedules.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#16666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16666), was opened by Dependabot to bump the `github.com/docker/docker` dependency from `27.5.1+incompatible` to `28.3.2+incompatible`.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Supervisor Stability and Event Handling\nSeveral issues related to the `op-supervisor`'s stability and event handling were closed. This includes the resolution of an event overflow problem on large unsafe head gaps ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16335)) and an investigation into spikes of `local-derived` events ([#16603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16603)). The discussions highlighted the complexity of event processing within the supervisor, with initial speculation pointing towards `ChainsDB` or `GlobalSyncExec` deadlocks. While a full panic stack trace was desired for complete confirmation, the fixes implemented are expected to mitigate these issues.\n\n### Interoperability and Genesis Configuration\nAn issue concerning the check for EL prestate regarding pre-interop `CrossL2Inbox` configuration faults ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15765)) was closed. The decision was made to close this issue as the execution client is not ideally positioned to perform this validation, and the risk of incorrect genesis generation has been significantly reduced through improvements in the `op-deployer` tooling. The `op-deployer` now automatically determines the inclusion of `CrossL2Inbox` based on the presence of multiple chains, ensuring correct deployment without requiring complex checks within the execution client.\n\n### OPCM Integration of Standard Validator\nThe task to integrate the `StandardValidator` into the OPCM ([#15799](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15799)) was successfully closed. This work involved aligning the `StandardValidator` with existing OPCM patterns, such as `OPCMDeployer` and `OPCMUpgrader`, prioritizing consistency and minimizing complexity.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Forge Test Linting Limitations\nA new issue, [#16662](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16662), was opened to address limitations in the `lint-forge-tests-check-no-build` script. The script currently excludes test files under `test/libraries/` due to its inability to properly process artifacts for Solidity libraries, as it assumes contract-style ABIs.

A new pipeline for platform metrics was introduced to integrate data from platform tooling into the BigQuery database [#1616](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1616). Adjustments were also made to handle evolutions in the L2Beat API provider field and the Dune API's date field format, ensuring continued data accuracy [#1685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1685), [#1688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1688).\n\n### Schema and Data Formatting Updates\nChanges were implemented to align data writes with current schemas, specifically by converting lists to comma-separated values for chain summaries [#1686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1686).\n\n### Version and Deployment Updates\nMultiple updates were made to bump versions and facilitate Dagster deployments [#1687](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1687), [#1689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1689), [#1690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1690).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Development Workflow Improvements\nAn issue related to nonce errors when approving and executing after one approval was closed, indicating a resolution to a critical development workflow hurdle [#1106](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1106).\n\n### Test Suite Expansion\nThe effort to port `TestERC20Bridge` to devstack was closed, signifying progress in expanding the test suite and ensuring broader compatibility [#415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/415).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Sync Tester Development\nDiscussion on [#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16452) (Tracking] [Sync Tester] op-sync-tester: service for mock EL sync testing) revolved around session management for the sync tester. @protolambda suggested using HTTP middleware for pre-processing requests and attaching context, while @pcw109550 proposed a session management flow involving a `sync_init` RPC and UUID-generated session IDs for dedicated endpoints. The core idea is to avoid creating a full EL deployment for long-range sync testing.\n\n### Interop Transaction Reinjection Testing\nOn [#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16656) (E2E: Invalid Interop Tx Reinjection Test), @pcw109550 outlined a testing strategy using `op-test-sequencer` to force invalid execution messages and then verify reorgs, the absence of invalid interop transactions in new L2 blocks, and their removal from the mempool.

This provides more comprehensive debugging information for Optimism-specific transactions. ([#407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/407))\n\n*   **Robust Interop Transaction Management**: The system now detects supervisor failsafe states and rejects interop transactions if the failsafe is active. This involves caching the supervisor's failsafe response locally within the backend and integrating this check into the transaction ingress process in the mempool and miner. ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/636))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n\n*   A new pull request, [#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/643), was opened to fix a p2p issue by using raw string literals for regular expressions.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n*   **Resolved Nonce Errors in Execution**: An issue related to nonce errors when approving and executing transactions after a single approval was closed. This problem, which caused `StateOverrideManager` errors due to user-defined nonces being less than current actual nonces, was resolved by a related pull request in `superchain-ops`. ([#1106](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1106))\n\n*   **Progress on ERC20 Bridge Porting**: The task to port `TestERC20Bridge` to devstack was closed, with the porting work completed and referenced in a related pull request.

They suggested that if either script is modified significantly, the other acts as a check. A potential approach is to re-run `DeployImplementations` within `VerifyOPCM` alongside its other checks.\n\n*   **E2E: Invalid Interop Tx Reinjection Test** ([#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16656)): @pcw109550 outlined a testing strategy using `op-test-sequencer` to force include invalid execution messages. The plan involves checking if the invalid message block is reorged, implicitly verifying that new L2 blocks do not contain invalid interop transactions, and explicitly checking the mempool to ensure the invalid message transaction is absent. A related PR ([#16569](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16569)) was referenced for inspecting the mempool.\n\n*   **Interop: Stress Test Expiry Window** ([#15285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15285)): @pauldowman clarified that the \"consolidation step\" refers to the final stage in the fault proof program where it validates executing messages after derivation. @mds1 sought clarification on this term. Earlier comments noted that the expiry window reduction to 7 days and microbenchmarks suggest no immediate issues, but a worst-case scenario test on actual interop-enabled chains is still desired.\n\n*   **op-batcher: duplicate code** ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16677)): @chuwt questioned the necessity of `checkTxpool` in `op-batcher/batcher/driver.go` given that `publishStateToL1` already performs this check. @geoknee acknowledged the observation and welcomed a PR to address the duplication.\n\n*   **Add lint for checking spelling** ([#680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/680)): @JoshdfG expressed interest in taking on the task of adding a `codespell` workflow for spelling checks, referencing a similar workflow in the `reth` repository.", "2025-09-04T03:27:58.565Z"]

This aims to support a broader range of gas token functionalities. ([#305](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/305))\n\n### Liquidity Controller Documentation Update\nDocumentation for the `LiquidityController` was enhanced by adding details for a new `deauthorizeMinter` function. This function enables chain operators to remove, replace, or deprecate previously authorized minters, improving operational flexibility. ([#329](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/329))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNone.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Challenger Support in op-up\nThe issue concerning the support of the challenger in `op-up` was closed, with the conclusion that distributing the challenger within `op-up` for `sysgo` use is likely not worth the effort. The focus will shift towards other backends like Docker that do not require binary distribution. ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17005))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNone.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### op-proposer Failed to Create Transaction ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/13502))\nThe discussion on this issue, which concerns the `op-proposer` failing to create transactions, saw a key resolution. A user confirmed that setting `--game-type=1` fixed the problem, aligning with previous suggestions to check and correctly configure the game type, especially for `PermissionedFaultDisputeGame`.\n\n### Sync Test Using the Sync-Tester ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16703))\nThe issue was reopened to address the need for testing every Hard Fork (HF) transition, not just Isthmus. New test case ideas were proposed, including checking all OP Stack HF transitions with real data, validating multiple CLs syncing together with individual mock EL endpoints, and testing user transactions within L2 blocks to ensure L2CLs are synced. Items 2 and 3 are being tracked in a separate issue.\n\n### Load Testing Flashblocks on Devnets ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16756))\nThe issue, which aims to perform load tests on `eris-0` to ensure public readiness, was briefly marked as done by accident but is still active. The team is currently working on a report summarizing the outcomes, including load test scenarios, networks used, and results.\n\n### Alert When Non-Flashblocks-Enabled Sequencer is Active or Flashblocks are Turned Off ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16867))\nThis issue focuses on creating an alert for situations where a non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer becomes active or flashblocks are disabled, indicating a potential issue. A pull request related to `rollup-boost` is in progress, and an alert will be created once it lands.\n\n### Alert on Low Peer Count Health of Flashblocks-Enabled Sequencer ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16868))\nThe discussion highlighted the criticality of healthy peers for flashblocks-enabled sequencers. It was noted that peer count alerting for `op-node` sequencer peering already exists for counts less than 2. The plan is to extend this by adding `reth`/`op-rbuilder` peer count alerts for this specific scenario.", "2025-09-04T03:29:55.544Z"]

The latest comment from `tessr` provided extensive context and ideas from @emilianobonassi regarding an alternative unsafe block sync mechanism. This alternative is highlighted for being cheaper, simpler, faster for scale-out and recovery, and complementary to existing p2p methods. It proposes a centralized driver for gossiping blocks, where the sequencer leader publishes the latest unsafe block via Redis, and other nodes subscribe and inject it via the `admin_postUnsafePayload` API. On restarts, a sidecar checks sync status against the sequencer leader and queries the EL to fetch and inject blocks.", "2025-09-04T03:30:15.595Z"]

Additionally, two key acceptance testing issues related to porting tests to Devstack were closed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### `op-acceptor` Test Runner Refactoring\nThe monolithic `op-acceptor` test runner was significantly refactored into five focused components, improving maintainability and separation of concerns. This involved splitting the 1,755-line `runner.go` file into `TestExecutor`, `OutputParser`, and other modules. ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/448))\n\n### Enhanced `op-acceptor` Logging\nLogging within `op-acceptor` was refined by splitting per-test logs into three distinct files: a plaintext `.txt` file, a raw JSON `.json` file, and a test result summary `.log` file. The HTML report was also updated to link to these new log formats.

Key points included identifying high-value CI jobs for local execution (e.g., `kurtosis` and `go-tests-short`), addressing friction from automated prerequisite setup, and the potential for automating CircleCI config syntax validation. There was also an interesting idea about dynamically sorting Go tests by execution time to optimize local test runs and potentially categorize them for post-merge execution if they exceed certain time thresholds.\n\n### Kona + Cannon Integration and OPCM Support\nDiscussions on [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17285) and [#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17283) continued regarding the integration of Kona and Cannon into the tooling and OPCM. For OPCM support, it was confirmed that the system needs to support deploying the new game type, specifically updating an `if` block in `OPContractsManager.sol`. For standard prestates integration, the suggestion was to use a `type = \"cannon-kona\"` field in `standard-prestates.toml`, with the version number not necessarily needing to match `op-program`.\n\n### P2P Gossip Configuration Bug\nIssue [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17308) highlighted a bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values, leading to panics in certain tests due to invalid configurations (e.g., `Dhi=0` and `Dscore=4`). The discussion explored whether to make invalid configs work or to introduce a `DefaultP2PConfig` method that returns a fully filled, valid configuration with sensible defaults, allowing tests to modify only necessary options.\n\n### Sync Test Using Sync-Tester\nIssue [#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16703) was reopened as not all Hardfork (HF) transitions were tested. Suggestions for future test cases include checking every OP Stack HF transition, using multiple CLs with a single Sync Tester to validate multi-CL syncing, and incorporating user transactions into L2 blocks to ensure L2CLs sync correctly.\n\n### Go 1.25 Compatibility for Cannon\nDiscussion on [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17060) noted the release of Go 1.25.1, but questioned if it includes the MIPS fix.\n\n### Min-Base-Fee for PayloadAttributesV3\nIssue [#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/650) received a comment pointing to the updated specs for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3`.\n\n### Script for Permissionless Devnet Spinup\nIssue [#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/346) had a comment asking if it could be closed, indicating potential completion or irrelevance.", "2025-09-04T03:30:33.210Z"]

Key points include identifying high-value CI jobs for local execution (e.g., `kurtosis` and `go-tests-short`), addressing friction from prerequisite setup steps, and exploring dynamic sorting of Go tests by duration to optimize local and CI test runs. The idea of new manifest files for Go packages based on test duration and a script to update them locally was proposed.\n\n### P2P Gossip Configuration Bug\nAn active discussion is ongoing regarding a bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values in `op-node/p2p/gossip` [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17308). The core problem is that zero values from CLI changes can lead to invalid configurations, causing panics in `go-libp2p-pubsub`. A potential solution discussed is adding a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to return a fully filled, valid configuration with sensible defaults, allowing tests to modify only necessary options.\n\n### Kona + Cannon Integration and Compatibility\nDiscussions are active on integrating Kona + Cannon into existing tooling and ensuring compatibility. This includes verifying necessary changes in OPCM to support the new game type [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17285) and integrating Cannon + Kona into standard prestates management, with a proposed format for `standard-prestates.toml` [#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17283).

The latest comments highlight the debate between making invalid configurations work versus enforcing valid defaults. A user (`wood-jp`) explained that a dependency update exposed this issue, causing panics in tests due to `Dhi=0` and `Dscore=4`. The core of the problem is that `MeshDHi` is unset in tests, defaulting to 0, which then clobbers the intended default of 12. An alternative solution proposed by `ajsutton` is to introduce a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to return a fully valid configuration with sensible defaults, allowing tests to modify only necessary options. ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17308))\n\n### op-geth Initialization Error\nUsers continue to report an \"head block is not reachable\" error during `op-geth` initialization. A recent comment from `cliff0412` indicates they also encountered this issue. Previously, `SyedMuhamadYasir` suggested that this error might not be critical and to proceed with the setup, while `lei335` found that re-running the initialization command resolved it for them. However, `mikelear` noted that despite proceeding, `geth` remains at Block 0, leading to further issues with block proposals.

The latest comments from `wood-jp` and `ajsutton` explore potential solutions. `wood-jp` explained that the issue arose from a dependency update (`go-libp2p-pubsub v0.12.0 => v0.14.2`) exposing a panic due to invalid `Dhi` and `Dscore` values (0 and 4 respectively). `ajsutton` suggested adding a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to return a fully filled, valid configuration with sensible defaults, allowing tests to modify only necessary options. `wood-jp` acknowledged this but expressed a preference for the current PR's approach, noting that `DefaultP2PConfig` might require future developers to be aware of its existence.", "2025-09-04T03:30:41.828Z"]

Development efforts centered on expanding the acceptance testing framework, particularly for interop and flashblocks scenarios, and advancing the `op-supervisor`'s capabilities for handling resets and safety modes. Critical bug fixes were deployed for `op-deployer`, improving the reliability of the Superchain deployment process. Meanwhile, active investigation continues into performance issues like `op-node` goroutine leaks and high CPU usage in `op-geth`, highlighting a dual focus on new feature development and maintaining production stability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on hardening the stack through comprehensive testing, advancing supervisor capabilities, and fixing critical deployment tooling.\n\n- **Testing and Validation Overhaul:** The testing framework saw major enhancements to improve reliability and test coverage. New acceptance tests were added for flashblocks transfers ([#16515](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16515)) and withdrawals with super roots ([#16491](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16491)). The interop testing suite was expanded with an adversarial load test ([#16433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16433)), a dedicated gate for load tests ([#16564](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16564)), and tests for spamming invalid messages ([#16459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16459)). A new validation script was introduced to enforce consistent test structure conventions ([#16543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16543)), with several PRs dedicated to bringing existing tests into compliance ([#16561](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16561), [#16590](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16590), [#16596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16596)).\n\n- **`op-supervisor` and Interop Advancements:** The `op-supervisor` received significant updates to improve its role in a multi-chain environment. A new API was introduced to support a \"Failsafe\" mode, allowing for administrative control to halt operations ([#16582](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16582)). The supervisor is now able to determine local unsafe targets and initiate node resets ([#16557](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16557)), and can automatically enable Failsafe mode upon detecting an invalid block ([#16593](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16593)). Internal refactoring improved modularity by separating context from event objects ([#16540](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16540)) and renaming supervisor/node modes for clarity ([#16464](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16464)).\n\n- **Deployment and Tooling Reliability:** The `op-deployer` was made more robust with several critical fixes and new tests. Incorrect artifact hashes for `v4.0.0` and `rc.8` were corrected ([#16562](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16562), [#16565](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16565)), and a fix was implemented to ensure deployment idempotency ([#16567](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16567)). New end-to-end bootstrap tests were added to validate the Superchain deployment process against local and tagged artifacts ([#16575](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16575)).\n\n- **Core Service Enhancements:** Various components received targeted improvements. The `cannon` MIPS emulator's `getrandom` syscall logic was updated for better stability ([#16529](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16529)). The `op-faucet` gained a `faucet_balance` RPC ([#16516](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16516)), and `op-service` was enhanced with safe subtraction functions ([#16539](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16539)). In `op-program`, safeguards were added to prevent typos in custom chain configurations ([#16580](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16580)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Key problems resolved this week include improving CI stability by releasing a test flake report generator ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16271)) and deciding against implementing CI SLAs for now ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16437)).

The need for `flashblocks-rpc` node deployment ([#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16764)) is being re-evaluated.\n- **Flashblocks Spec Finalization:** Associated PRs for closing out the Flashblocks specification are being tracked ([#17162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17162)).\n- **Flashblocks on `op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-1` Mainnet:** Work is underway to enable Flashblocks on this specific mainnet sequencer, involving `rollup-boost` deployment and subsequent execution mode enablement after stability observation ([#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17317)).\n\n### `op-node/p2p/gossip` Configuration Bug\n- A bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values was discussed ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17308)). The issue arises from `libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub` panicking when `Dhi=0` and `Dscore=4`, which occurs because `MeshDHi` is unset in tests, defaulting to 0 and clobbering the intended default of 12. A potential solution of adding a `DefaultP2PConfig` method for valid defaults was suggested.\n\n### `op-geth` Initialization Error\n- Users continue to report \"head block is not reachable\" errors during `op-geth` initialization ([#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/420)). While some users suggest continuing with setup as the error might not be critical, others report `geth` remaining at Block 0 and issues with parent block nil errors.\n\n### Sync-Tester Network Exposure\n- Discussions are ongoing to expose more networks inside the CI box for `op-sync-tester` ([#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/454)). L2 ELs for mainnet and Sepolia are currently exposed, with the remaining task being the exposure of an L1 beacon API in CI.

Finally, for [#17162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17162), associated PRs for closing out the Flashblocks spec were noted.\n\n**P2P Gossip Configuration Bug**\nIssue [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17308) discusses a bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values. The latest comments delve into the implications of invalid configuration values (e.g., `Dhi=0` and `Dscore=4` causing panics in `go-libp2p-pubsub`) and potential solutions, including adding a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to return a fully filled, valid `P2PConfig` with sensible defaults.\n\n**Sync-Tester Network Exposure**\nIn [#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/454), the discussion revolves around exposing more networks inside the CI box for `op-sync-tester`. Updates confirm that L2 ELs for mainnet and sepolia are exposed for several networks (unichain, ink, base). The remaining task is to expose an L1 beacon API in CI. A draft PR was shared to make the synctest more dynamic with environment variables.\n\n**Geth Initialization Error**\nIssue [#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/420) continues to receive comments regarding the \"head block is not reachable\" error during `op-geth` initialization. A new comment confirms that this error is still being encountered.", "2025-10-13T20:46:59.792Z"]

This involved significant changes across core components, alongside addressing forward compatibility for gas parameter extraction. Several issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature were closed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Minimum Base Fee Implementation\nA new feature introducing a minimum base fee has been integrated, building upon previous work. This enhancement modifies how base fees are calculated and enforced within the Optimism EIP-1559 implementation, impacting block parameters, API, and miner payload building. ([#666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/666))\n\n### Forward-Compatible Gas Parameter Extraction\nWork was completed to ensure the forward compatibility of Isthmus gas parameter extraction, specifically within the `core/types/rollup_cost.go` file. ([#671](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/671))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Minimum Base Fee Feature Integration\nThree issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature have been closed, indicating successful integration and resolution. These include adding `minBaseFee` to the block header's `extraData` field ([#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/649)), incorporating an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3` ([#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/650)), and updating `eip1559.CalcBaseFee` to enforce the minimum when the feature is active ([#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/651)). All closures are directly linked to the implementation of pull request [#666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/666).\n\n### NAT Testing Environment Shift\nThe issue concerning running `op-nat` in Kurtosis has been closed ([#158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/158)). This decision reflects a shift in priority towards other local development environments.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Large Genesis File Initialization Challenges\nDiscussion continues on an issue regarding `op-geth` initialization with a large 7GB genesis file, leading to a LevelDB panic ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/668)). The latest comment from @protolambda suggests that the Genesis-State-Spec (the \"alloc\" part of `genesis.json`) is optional and not typically stored in `geth`. The recommendation is to modify `op-geth` for a one-time state import by not storing the alloc data as a flat JSON blob and instead importing the state into the DB. It's also advised to include the `stateHash` attribute of the genesis block into the chain-`config` part of `genesis.json` to enable fresh nodes to snap-sync state from bootstrap nodes. This approach aligns with how `op-mainnet` operates, avoiding excessively large `op-geth` binaries or Docker images.\n\n### Superchain Configuration Explicitness\nAn ongoing discussion revolves around making chain configurations fully explicit within the `superchain` package ([#763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/763)). The latest comment from @alfonso-op questions whether chain configurations are already self-descriptive and if the issue can be closed, indicating a potential resolution or clarification needed on the current state of configuration completeness.", "2025-10-13T20:47:02.808Z"]

changes ([#17337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17337)).\n\n### Minimum Base Fee Configuration\n*   A task has been created to load the minimum base fee value from `SystemConfig` contract events ([#17340](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17340)).\n\n### Jovian Fork Testing\n*   An issue has been opened to run precompile Fault Proof tests on the Jovian fork ([#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17348)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### op-geth init with large genesis file, level db panic ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/668))\nThe discussion revolves around initializing `op-geth` with a large 7GB genesis file and a resulting LevelDB panic. The primary challenge is the size of the genesis state and how to handle it efficiently without embedding the full state into the `op-geth` binary. `protolambda` suggests modifying `op-geth` for a one-time import of state by not storing the alloc data as a flat JSON blob and instead importing the state directly into the DB. It's also recommended to include the `stateHash` attribute of the genesis block into the chain-`config` part of `genesis.json` to enable fresh nodes to snap-sync state from other bootstrap nodes. This strategy aligns with how `op-mainnet` handles large genesis states. `cliff0412` acknowledged the advice, confirming they will not save the `genesis.json`.", "2025-10-13T20:47:07.324Z"]

A monitoring dashboard has been completed, and related alerting PRs have been raised. Discussions include defining key metrics like peer count, block progression SLAs, pending transaction thresholds, and flashblocks-specific metrics such as `reth_op_rbuilder_total_block_built_duration`. The absence of certain metrics should also trigger alerts.\n\n### Exposing More Networks in CI Box for Sync Tester ([#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/454))\nThe discussion revolves around exposing L2 ELs and L1 beacon APIs in CI for various networks (mainnet, sepolia, base, unichain, ink) to facilitate `op-sync-tester`'s ability to test with real chain data. Mainnet L2 RPCs are available, and the L1 beacon API for ETH Mainnet is being addressed. The issue is largely considered done, with some refactoring planned for daily tests.\n\n### Acceptance Tests in Persistent Devnets ([#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/398))\nWhile significant progress has been made in running acceptance tests in persistent devnets, some tests are still failing on Eris. New tickets have been created to follow up on specific failing tests like `TestERC20Bridge` and `TestOperatorFeeDevstack`. L1 Faucet support was previously added to aid in this effort.", "2025-10-13T20:47:22.218Z"]

Further testing for `min-base-fee` was proposed by running `actions/proof` tests against Kona ([#17483](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17483)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### `TestPreNoInbox` Flakiness\nThe issue [#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17298) concerning the flakiness of `TestPreNoInbox` in `op-acceptance-tests` remains active. A recent comment from `scharissis` on Sep 16, 2025, reported another flake, indicating the problem persists despite attempts to fix it. `pcw109550` later confirmed on Sep 17, 2025, that a recent PR did not resolve the issue.\n\n### Token Bridging Clarification\nIssue [#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1203) discusses a token bridging problem. `AlexBHarley` commented on Sep 16, 2025, suggesting that the token at `0x431151F26c48B4D4BEFc34048a0966Bf960A0c50` might not be an `OptimismMintableERC20`, which would explain why the generated entry lacks a bridge address. Verification of the implementation was suggested to confirm this.\n\n### `protocol/system-config.md` Cleanup\nIssue [#771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/771) focuses on cleaning up the `protocol/system-config.md` documentation. `joshklop` on Sep 16, 2025, relayed a suggestion from `sebastianst` to include both the numerical value and the canonical name (e.g., `MIN_BASE_FEE` and `6`) for config update enums, and to link to fork-specific specs for hard fork-added config updates.", "2025-10-13T20:48:01.734Z"]

A temporary disablement of `TestSyncTesterELSync` was implemented due to flakiness, with re-enablement tracked separately ([#17617](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17617)).\n\n### Deployment and Configuration Updates\nSupport for custom gasLimit was added to `op-deployer`, aligning with `op-contracts/v3.0.1` and enabling more flexible chain deployments ([#17585](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17585)). The `OPContractsManager` was updated to zero out cannon-kona game types during migration when the `CANNON_KONA` dev feature is enabled ([#17523](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17523)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#17607](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17607) fix(challenger): reduce asterisc info logging frequency from 10M to 1\u2026: This PR aims to reduce the frequency of info logging in the challenger component.\n- [#17613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17613) op-deployer: prepare deploy scripts with forge invokers: This PR prepares deploy scripts by integrating forge invokers.\n- [#17622](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17622) op-dispute-mon: node endpoint error metrics: This PR introduces error metrics for node endpoints in the dispute monitor.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Custom Gas Token Refinements\nSeveral issues related to the Custom Gas Token feature were closed, including a general review ([#17586](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17586)), minor naming conventions ([#17587](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17587)), considerations for explicit custom error cases ([#17588](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17588), [#17601](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17601)), and refactoring test contracts with `skipIfDevFeatureDisabled` ([#17604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17604)).\n\n### Test Suite Improvements\nIssues addressing test suite improvements were closed, such as refactoring `OptimismPortal2.t.sol` ([#17593](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17593), [#17591](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17591), [#17592](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17592)), merging `L1Block` tests using `DevFeatures` ([#17596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17596)), removing unnecessary `virtual` tags ([#17595](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17595)), splitting assertions in tests ([#17598](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17598)), and refactoring test initializers ([#17603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17603)).\n\n### Helper Functions and Setup Refactoring\nIssues related to code organization and test setup were closed, including adding `_authorizeMinter(_minter)` as a helper function ([#17600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17600)) and replacing `setInputCGTEnabled` modifier with `setUp` in tests ([#17605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17605)).\n\n### Critical Bug Resolution\nA critical bug where the recommit mechanism failed due to interrupt signal reuse, leading to degraded transaction throughput, was identified and closed ([#17606](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17606)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Test Flakiness Investigation\nAn issue was opened to investigate and root cause failures in `TestSyncTesterELSync` within `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17615](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17615)).\n\n### Recommit Mechanism Failure\nA new issue was created to address the recommit mechanism in `op-geth` failing due to interrupt signal reuse, resulting in blocks with only one transaction ([#17606](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17606)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Fusaka Preparation for op-batcher ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17472))\nDiscussion continues on preparing `op-batcher` for the Fusaka activation on L1. The key point is that the batcher will need to send blob transactions with *cell proofs* instead of *blob proofs*. A recipe for manual testing against a Fusaka L1 has been shared to aid in this transition.\n\n### Snag Report on Improved Superchain-Ops Flow ([#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1224))\nFeedback on the `superchain-ops` signing flow highlights several areas for improvement. Key discussion points include:\n- The printing of markdown with 'TODOs' during task simulation: While intended for task developers, it's questioned if this impacts the signer's UX, especially if signers are expected to simulate tasks.\n- The experimental nature of audit reports in the workflow: The language around this needs to be clarified as it's not a fully committed feature.\n- The necessity of `op-txverify` for all signers: This remains an open decision point.\n- The need for clearer markdown and validation for state diffs, particularly for non-OPCM upgrades.\n- A request for an explanation of the \"normalized state diff hash.\"\nA PR has been raised to address some of these snags.\n\n### Deduplicate Engine API Validations in `Miner.prepareWork` ([#688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/688))\nThe discussion revolves around the duplication of Engine API validation checks in `Miner.prepareWork` that are already performed in `eth/catalyst/api_optimism.go`. There's a suggestion to move additional checks into the Engine API, such as:\n- Optimism chains requiring a force-included L1 attributes deposit transaction.\n- Jovian requiring a specific length (178 bytes) for L1 attributes deposit data to extract `daFootprintScalar`.", "2025-10-13T20:48:47.969Z"]

Key updates include new dispute game flags, a fix for acceptance job memory usage, and updates for Fusaka compatibility.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Contract Enhancements & Feature Flags\nNew development feature flags, `CANNON_KONA` and `DEPLOY_V2_DISPUTE_GAMES`, were added to the bedrock contracts test matrix to support future dispute game functionalities ([#17635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17635)). Additionally, a basic rules file for Diamond was introduced, establishing a starting point for style guidelines ([#17640](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17640)).\n\n### Bug Fixes in Testing and Transaction Management\nCritical bug fixes were implemented to optimize the testing pipeline and ensure correct transaction behavior. The acceptance job now skips building contract tests, reducing memory usage and speeding up execution ([#17639](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17639)). A fix was also applied to the `auth minter` helper and `_mint` binding in `depositTransaction` tests ([#17642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17642)). Furthermore, the `txmgr` was updated to allow blobs to be sent with Fusaka-compatible cell proofs by configuration, addressing a key requirement for Fusaka activation on L2 ([#17620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17620)).\n\n### Testing Infrastructure Improvements\nSeveral updates were made to enhance the robustness and reliability of the testing suite. A new test was added for popping the same element in `op-node/rollup/clsync` ([#17608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17608)). The `op-acceptor` was updated to version `v3.4.2` ([#17623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17623)), and the `op-sync-tester` now retries block fetching when processing `newPayload` to prevent flakiness in `TestSyncTesterELSync` ([#17624](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17624)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#17626](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17626), was opened to remove `check-{canyon,delta,ecotone,fjord}` commands from `op-chain-ops`.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Fusaka Compatibility and Testing Flakiness Resolved\nThe issue of `op-batcher` preparing for Fusaka activation, specifically sending blob transactions with cell proofs, has been resolved ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17472)). Additionally, the root cause of `TestSyncTesterELSync` failures in `op-acceptance-tests` has been identified and addressed ([#17615](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17615)).\n\n### Contract Test Consolidation\nThe `L2ToL1MessagePasser` tests have been merged using `DevFeatures`, allowing for better organization and maintenance of contract tests ([#17597](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17597)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### L2CL and L2EL Synchronization Challenges\nNew issues have been opened to investigate the conditions for L2EL to start EL Syncing, particularly concerning `op-geth` with `op-sepolia` ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17628)). Further challenges include ensuring the verifier syncs to the tip of the chain, reaching the unsafe head through L1 reads and advancing safe heads ([#17629](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17629)).\n\n### Sequencer and EL Sync Mode\nAn issue has been raised to understand why the sequencer cannot advance blocks when in EL Sync mode and to consolidate `sync.CLSync` and `sync.ELSync` modes ([#17630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17630)).\n\n### EL Sync Testing with Multiple Implementations\nA need has been identified to validate L2CL by mimicking multiple L2EL implementations for initial EL Sync, especially concerning different network behaviors and engine API responses ([#17632](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17632)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### L2CL<>L2EL: Find out condition of L2EL for starting EL Syncing ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17628))\nThe discussion revolves around the conditions under which an Execution Layer (EL) client can initiate syncing, particularly for `op-geth` on `op-sepolia`. While the initial confusion about triggering snap-sync twice has been clarified, the consensus is that the EL client should simply sync, regardless of the specific mechanism (snap-sync or full block execution via p2p). The latest comment suggests that this issue might be handled by `engineController.insertUnsafePayload` and could potentially be closed, as the focus for removing `ReqRes` sync may shift to EL Syncs after the initial run. The key takeaway is that the EL client's prerequisites for backfilling should primarily be p2p connections to other nodes and receiving a `FCU` call to set new sync targets.", "2025-10-13T20:48:49.809Z"]

The L2 sync test was tweaked to verify chain advancement beyond genesis, and the `ReceivedUnsafePayloadEvent` was removed to streamline the rollup driver's synchronization logic.\n- refactor(test): standardize Unclassified to Uncategorized in test naming ([#17650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17650))\n- op-e2e: Tweak EL Sync Test to check non genesis ([#17440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17440))\n- op-node/rollup: remove ReceivedUnsafePayloadEvent event ([#17530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17530))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **op-test-sequencer bug fixes**: A new pull request ([#17653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17653)) aims to fix bugs introduced by a previous change related to L1 Geth subprocess support.\n- **op-geth upgrade**: Another pull request ([#17655](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17655)) proposes upgrading `op-geth` across the codebase.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Flashblocks RPC Deployment and Evaluation\nSeveral issues related to the deployment and evaluation of flashblocks-rpc nodes and rollup-boost as a flashblocks forwarder were closed. This included deploying a flashblocks-rpc node ([#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16764)), implementing rollup-boost as a flashblocks forwarder ([#17457](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17457)), deploying these changes on eris-0 ([#17458](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17458)), and conducting load tests for the flashblocks forwarder on eris-0 ([#17462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17462)). The load tests were performed and documented, with notes on latency due to geographical distance.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Sequencer Block Progression\nA new issue ([#17654](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17654)) has been opened regarding the sequencer not advancing blocks when the node is in ELSync. The problem requires diagnosing the failure mode and consolidating `sync.CLSync` and `sync.ELSync` into a consistent path.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### L2CL<>L2EL: Find out condition of L2EL for starting EL Syncing ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17628))\nThe discussion on this issue revolves around understanding the conditions under which the Execution Layer (EL) can start EL Syncing, particularly for `op-geth` with `op-sepolia`. Recent comments clarify that the EL client should simply sync, and the method of backfilling blocks (e.g., snap-sync vs. full block execution) is an implementation detail of the EL. The consensus is that the EL doesn't need to trigger snap-sync if it already has a finalized sync, but it will still sync to the new chain head. The ticket may be closed as the issue might be handled by `engineController.insertUnsafePayload` when removing ReqRes sync.", "2025-10-13T20:48:54.705Z"]

Additionally, comments related to unsafe payload queue syncing logic in `op-acceptance-tests` were corrected to accurately reflect the system's behavior [#17712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17712). A bug fix was also implemented to exclude Foundry VM addresses from L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger fuzz tests, preventing intermittent failures [#17709](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17709).\n\n### OP Contracts Manager and TimelockGuard Updates\nThe OP Contracts Manager now supports Cannon and Kona games in `updatePrestates` through a new struct, allowing for incremental updates [#17512](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17512). A full implementation of the `TimelockGuard` was completed, featuring external signature validation for `cancelTransaction` and `configureTimelockGuard`, and a single struct per Safe [#17584](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17584).\n\n### Beacon Client and Deployer Optimizations\nThe `op-deployer`'s default `GasPadFactor` was reduced from 2.0 to 1.2 to ensure `opcm.deploy` transactions remain under the 16.77Mgas limit imposed by EIP-7825 [#17710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17710). Furthermore, the `op-service/L1BeaconClient` now allows blob proof verification to be skipped via a new `l1.beacon.skip-blob-verification` flag, which has also been added to `op-program` and `op-challenger` [#17713](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17713), [#17718](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17718).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#17717](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17717): This pull request aims to correct a `console.log` format string within the `ManageDrippie` script.\n- [#17720](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17720): This pull request proposes a refactor to improve the test coverage and quality of `ProtocolVersions` tests.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Fusaka Activation Test\nThe issue regarding the need for a Fusaka activation test, similar to the L1 Prague fork test, has been closed [#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17500).

Substantial effort was dedicated to stabilizing the Flashblocks service, with successful coordination with RPC providers and fixes for proxy stability. While progress was strong, the team continues to navigate a critical compatibility issue with Go 1.25 affecting Cannon, which remains a primary technical challenge.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month focused on enhancing cross-chain functionality, executing network upgrades, and improving developer tooling.\n\n*   **L1-to-L2 Interoperability:** A major feature was merged to enable L1 to L2 call execution from an L1 Safe using the Optimism Portal. This update includes a new template and configuration-driven parameters to streamline cross-chain interactions ([#1231](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1231)).\n\n*   **Chain Maintenance & Upgrades:** Several tasks related to network upgrades were completed. Tasks for the Arena and Swell mainnets were marked as executed ([#1250](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1250)), and an example task was refined to resolve a CI issue ([#1240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1240)).\n\n*   **Tooling & Performance:**\n    *   New validation instructions were added for `op-txverify` to improve usability ([#1251](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1251)).\n    *   Base commands were optimized for faster execution speed ([#1241](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1241)).\n    *   A template for `SetRespectedGameTypeTemplate.sol` was updated ([#1252](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1252)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month centered on finalizing major upgrades, stabilizing Flashblocks, and addressing complex ongoing technical challenges.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:**\n    *   **Network Upgrades:** The tracking issue for the Isthmus upgrade was officially closed, marking its successful completion ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/12703)). Testing for the Fusaka activation on L1 was also completed and closed ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17500)).\n    *   **Flashblocks Stability:** A series of issues related to Flashblocks were resolved. This included refining alerts ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17423)), fixing proxy connectivity issues that caused lost flashblocks ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17856)), and completing coordination with external RPC providers for a new node ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17857)).\n    *   **Tooling & Protocol Refinements:** Several issues were closed, including an improvement to acceptance test reporting ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/386)), an update to the DA footprint block limit specification ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/792)), and a clarification on L2EL sync conditions ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17628)). A proposal to refactor the `op-node` CLI was closed as not planned ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16680)).\n\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility:** A significant ongoing issue is Cannon's incompatibility with Go 1.25, which causes incorrect Keccak hashes. The problem is blocked by a required MIPS fix that was not included in the Go 1.25.1 release, making this a critical external dependency ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17060)).\n    *   **Dispute Monitor Logic:** Active discussion continues on how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes. The current challenge is that a lagging node can be incorrectly flagged as a disagreement. The proposed solution is to use `syncStatus` to verify a node has processed the relevant L1 block before including its results ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17814)).\n    *   **Tooling Strategy:** The integration of `op-reth` is being re-evaluated. With the Kurtosis devnet now deprecated, the focus has shifted to integrating it into the `devstack` or `sysgo` systems ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17475)).\n    *   **Incomplete Work:** An issue regarding the v2 dispute game implementation in OPCM.deploy was reopened, as a TODO item in the code indicates the work is not yet complete ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17257)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nWhile the reports indicate focused, internal development, a key example of ecosystem collaboration was the successful coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers. The team worked with external partners, including Blockscout, to ensure the smooth integration of a new Flashblocks RPC node ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17857)). Internally, active discussions on issues like the `op-dispute-mon` logic ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17814)) and Go compatibility ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17060)) demonstrate collaborative problem-solving on complex technical challenges facing the project.", "2025-10-17T05:28:26.268Z"]

Meanwhile, active discussions continued on improving the resilience of the dispute monitoring system, specifically in how it handles nodes that are out of sync.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on minor but important corrections to project documentation.\n\n- **Documentation:** A small spelling correction was made in the `_meta.json` file to improve the accuracy of the connection documentation ([#1195](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1195)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management focused on resolving stability problems, finalizing specifications, and debating the logic for dispute monitoring.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - **Flashblocks Stability:** A critical issue where the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` was losing Flashblocks due to connectivity and timeout problems was resolved through upgrades to `rollup-boost` ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17856)).\n    - **RPC Provider Coordination:** Coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers to integrate a new RPC node was successfully completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17857)).\n    - **Data Availability:** The Data Availability footprint specification was updated to use `blobBaseFee` instead of `gasUsed`, aligning it with the latest design ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/792)).\n    - **Dispute Games:** An issue related to the v2 dispute game implementation in `OPCM.deploy` was closed, though it was noted a TODO remains in the code ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17257)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - No new issues were opened this week.\n    - **Dispute Monitor Resilience:** A significant discussion is ongoing in `op-dispute-mon` regarding how to handle out-of-sync nodes ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17814)). The monitor currently detects false disagreements when one of its configured RPCs is lagging. The debate centers on whether to trust the highest L2 block (which could be a bad fork) or use `syncStatus` to identify and ignore results from nodes that are behind. The proposed solution leans towards using `syncStatus` to improve the monitor's accuracy.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week highlighted effective collaboration both internally and with external partners. The successful resolution of the Flashblocks RPC node integration ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17857)) demonstrates strong coordination with ecosystem RPC providers. Internally, the detailed technical discussion on the `op-dispute-mon` issue ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17814)) shows a collaborative effort to solve complex architectural problems related to protocol security and monitoring.", "2025-10-17T05:27:43.264Z"]

The core problem is that the monitor currently detects a disagreement when a behind node returns an older state, rather than using an in-sync node as the source of truth.\n\nKey points from the discussion:\n*   **Initial Proposal:** A suggestion was made to use `syncStatus` to determine the expected current L2 head. If a requested L2 block is in the future, it should be treated as such. If not, results from behind nodes should be ignored and logged.\n*   **Concerns about Highest Block:** A counter-argument highlighted that simply trusting the highest L2 block might be problematic, as it could originate from a node that followed an incorrect fork.\n*   **Focus on L1 Block Processing:** A more robust approach proposed checking the `CurrentL1` from the sync status to determine if a node has processed the L1 block where the dispute game was created. This would indicate if the node is sufficiently in sync.\n*   **Partial Solution:** A related PR, [#17819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/17819), is expected to reduce the problem to cases where a real output root not found error occurs.\n*   **Accidental Closure and Reopening:** The issue was briefly closed by mistake and then reopened, pending the merge of the related PR.", "2025-10-17T23:28:30.380Z"]

While no major features were completed, a critical discussion progressed on improving how the dispute monitor (`op-dispute-mon`) handles out-of-sync nodes, aiming to prevent false alerts and increase system reliability. Additionally, a routine but necessary pull request was opened to update a migrated token address, ensuring contract interactions remain accurate.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nNo pull requests were merged during this period. However, work was initiated on necessary maintenance:\n\n*   **Token Address Maintenance:** A pull request ([#1219](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1219)) was opened to update the WGC token address. This change is required following the token's migration and the LZ OFT upgrade from April 2025.\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo new issues were opened and no existing issues were closed this week. The primary focus was on an ongoing discussion regarding a key monitoring component.\n\n*   **New & Active Issues:** The most significant activity centered on issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17814), which addresses a problem where `op-dispute-mon` incorrectly detects a disagreement when one of its configured rollup RPCs is lagging. The discussion evolved from an initial proposal of using `syncStatus` to a more robust solution: checking if a node has processed the specific L1 block where a dispute game was created. This approach would more accurately determine if a node is sufficiently in sync to provide valid state information. A resolution is partially dependent on a related pull request ([#17819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/17819)) which is expected to mitigate some of the underlying problems.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe collaborative focus this week was evident in the detailed technical discussion on issue [#17814]. The conversation showcased a thorough problem-solving process, with contributors proposing, challenging, and refining solutions to improve the dispute monitor's logic. This highlights the community's commitment to ensuring the security and reliability of the core protocol infrastructure.", "2025-10-18T23:29:41.514Z"]

Several new pull requests were opened, primarily addressing testing and build process improvements. Two issues were closed, one related to `op-conductor` and another concerning dispute game factory implementation.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Fault Dispute Game Contract Refinement\nThe `FaultDisputeGameV2` contracts were updated to pass the game type as a `CWIA` argument instead of a constructor argument. This change allows a single `FaultDisputeGame` deployment to be used for both cannon and cannon-kona, improving flexibility and reducing redundancy. This modification involved changes across multiple contract files and tests.
