# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September's efforts focused on expanding Superchain analytics and advancing key technical discussions for future protocol enhancements. The primary completed work involved adding new chain analysis outputs, including gas limit data and analytical plots for several ecosystem chains. Meanwhile, significant planning and problem-solving continued around the integration of the Kona/Cannon fault-proof system, improvements to CI/CD and testing infrastructure, and resolving a P2P gossip configuration bug.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month saw a direct enhancement to the project's analytical capabilities, providing deeper insights into the health and configuration of various chains in the Superchain ecosystem.

- **Chain Analysis Expansion:** New chain analysis output was merged, providing updated gas limit data for Ink, Mode, Soneium, Unichain, and Worldchain. This update also included new analytical plots and an updated README for the `jovian_analysis` notebook, improving the tooling for chain monitoring ([#1740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1740)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed based on the provided reports. However, active discussions on existing issues highlight key areas of focus for the project's evolution.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Kona/Cannon Integration:** Discussions continued on integrating the next-generation fault-proof system. Conversations centered on enabling OPCM to deploy the new game type ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17285)) and defining how the `cannon-kona` type will be represented in standard prestates ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17283)).
    - **P2P Networking Bug:** A significant bug in the `op-node/p2p/gossip` module was discussed, where `ConfigureGossip` can overwrite valid defaults with zero values, leading to panics ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17308)). Potential solutions include creating a default configuration method to ensure node stability.
    - **Developer Experience & Testing:** Efforts to improve the developer workflow are ongoing. Discussions on the CircleCI configuration aim to improve local testability and automate validation ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17184)). Concurrently, the sync tester enhancement issue was revisited to ensure comprehensive testing across all OP Stack hard fork transitions ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16703)).
    - **Go Compatibility:** The team is monitoring Go 1.25.1 for a MIPS fix that is relevant to Cannon's compatibility, though the fix does not appear to be included in the latest point release ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17060)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was characterized by in-depth technical discussions on active issues. The conversations around Kona/Cannon integration, P2P configuration, and CI/CD improvements show a high degree of engagement from core contributors in planning and refining critical aspects of the OP Stack. These discussions are crucial for laying the groundwork for future development and ensuring the long-term stability and decentralization of the protocol.
