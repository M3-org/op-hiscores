# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
June was a month of significant progress in both data infrastructure and core protocol stability. The analytics pipeline saw major enhancements, with new integrations to pull data directly from the Superchain Registry and on-chain contracts, improving data accuracy for the ecosystem. Concurrently, deep investigations were conducted into the stability and correctness of the `op-supervisor`, focusing on its behavior during resets and reorgs. A large number of issues related to Superchain-Ops tooling were closed, marking a major milestone in improving developer experience and operational efficiency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development work this month centered on strengthening the data analytics foundation and improving pipeline reliability.

*   **Superchain Data Integration:** A primary focus was enriching the analytics dataset by integrating directly with Superchain sources. This included pulling the full chain list ([#1642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1642)) and chain address lists ([#1641](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1641)) from the Superchain Registry. A new pipeline was also introduced to pull system configuration data directly from on-chain contracts, ensuring data accuracy ([#1646](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1646)).
*   **Pipeline Infrastructure & Reliability:** The data pipeline's robustness was improved through several key updates. A bug in the BigQuery series function, critical for updating L1 cost fields, was fixed ([#1643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1643)). The Dagster dependency was updated twice ([#1644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1644), [#1647](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1647)) to leverage the latest features. Logging in `runner.py` was also enhanced for better clarity ([#1640](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1640)).
*   **Metadata Management:** A new `build_all_chains_metadata()` pipeline was introduced to integrate Total Crypto metadata, creating a more structured and extensible approach for managing comprehensive chain metadata ([#1629](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1629)).
*   **Notebook Maintenance:** Minor adjustments were made to notebooks used for tracking transactions on other chains ([#1661](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1661), [#1662](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1662)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in June was characterized by the resolution of a large backlog of tooling improvements and a deep focus on active investigations into core component stability.

*   **Closed Issues:** A significant cleanup occurred on June 26, with the closure of numerous issues related to **Superchain-Ops tooling**. These resolutions improved CI/CD processes ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/337), [#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/648)), task management and architecture ([#600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/600), [#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/636)), and developer UX ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/770), [#777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/777)). Other notable closures included resolving a module import error in `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` ([#1146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1146)) and clarifying the deprecation of `L2OutputOracleProxy` ([#1614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1614)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **`op-supervisor` Stability:** This was the most prominent area of discussion. Active investigations centered on improving the supervisor's handling of L1 origin validity during resets ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16315)) and its behavior during reorgs ([#16321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16321)). A critical issue involving an event overflow and potential crash-looping during large unsafe head gaps ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16335)) led to efforts to add better metrics for debugging. A new issue was opened to investigate event spikes that suggest potential congestion ([#16603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16603)).
    *   **Node Health & Correctness:** Users reported an incorrect nonce being returned by `eth_getTransactionCount` on a Base node, causing stuck transactions ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/623)). Another active thread involved diagnosing abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` v1.101511.0 ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/613)), with discussion pointing towards a temporary issue related to a log indexing rebuild.
    *   **CI Flakiness:** Efforts continued to investigate and improve CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16271)), with progress reported on a test flake report generator and an overall improvement in test stability.
    *   **New Dependencies & Errors:** New issues were opened to address a broken `go-bip39` dependency in `op-chain-ops` ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16612)) and to add missing error codes for data availability errors ([#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/725)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident in the deep technical discussions surrounding core component stability and the active engagement from the community on user-facing bugs.

*   **Intensive Debugging Efforts:** Issues like the `op-supervisor` event overflow ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16335)) showcased strong collaboration between core contributors, who actively debated potential causes and worked towards implementing better diagnostics.
*   **Community Bug Reporting:** The issues concerning `op-geth` CPU usage ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/613)) and the incorrect nonce ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/623)) saw active participation from users, who provided `pprof` files, stack traces, and consistent requests for updates, aiding the diagnostic process.
*   **Contributor Interest:** An issue to refactor terminal output ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/781)) attracted interest from multiple community members who expressed a desire to contribute, highlighting a healthy and engaged developer community.
