# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development focused on enhancing data integration and improving system stability. Key efforts included integrating Superchain configuration data directly into the analytics pipeline, providing better access to EIP-1559 parameters. Work was also done to refine the accuracy of financial reporting for the Optimism Collective. On the operational front, significant progress was made in resolving stability issues related to Flashblocks and advancing the design of the dispute monitoring system to handle out-of-sync nodes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on data pipeline enhancements and financial reporting accuracy.

- **Superchain Data Integration**
  A new feature was introduced to pull Superchain configuration data, specifically `eip1559_elasticity` and `eip1559_denominator`, directly from the `superchain-registry`. This enhancement ([#1750](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1750)) improves data accessibility and consistency for core protocol parameters within the analytics suite.

- **Collective Economics Refinements**
  Improvements were made to the collective balance calculations and revenue wallet configurations ([#1754](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1754), [#1755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1755)). This work, which included bug fixes, ensures more accurate financial reporting for the Optimism Collective.

- **Data Processing Fixes**
  A pull request ([#1753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1753)) was opened to address ongoing issues with DataFrame mapping and datetime parsing, aiming to increase the robustness of data handling.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on resolving stability problems and making key architectural decisions.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks Stability:** A cluster of issues related to Flashblocks was resolved. This included enhancing alerts and runbooks ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17423)), addressing problems with lost Flashblocks ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17856)), and improving coordination with RPC providers ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17857)).
  - **`op-node` Architecture:** An investigation into splitting `op-node`'s components was concluded, and the corresponding issue ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16680)) was closed as "not planned," solidifying the current architectural approach.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Dispute Monitoring:** A key discussion occurred in issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17814) regarding how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync rollup RPC nodes. The consensus is moving toward using the highest L2 block as the expected head and ignoring lagging nodes, representing significant future work for the monitoring tool's reliability.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Based on the available reports, collaboration was focused and technical. The resolution of the Flashblock alert issue ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17423)) pointed to cross-repository work with the `k8s` repository. Additionally, the active discussion on the `op-dispute-mon` issue ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17814)) highlights focused collaboration among contributors to solve complex monitoring challenges.
