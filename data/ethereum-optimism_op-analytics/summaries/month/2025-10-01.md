# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development began with a focus on enhancing data integration from the broader Superchain ecosystem. A key feature was introduced to pull EIP-1559 configuration parameters directly from the `superchain-registry`, improving the accuracy and accessibility of on-chain data within `op-analytics`. Additionally, issue triage saw the closure of items related to `op-node` architecture and flashblock alerting, reflecting ongoing refinement and decision-making around the core infrastructure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving data pipelines that feed into the analytics platform.

- **Superchain Configuration Integration**
  A new feature was implemented to pull `eip1559_elasticity` and `eip1559_denominator` values from the `superchain-registry`. This enhancement ensures that analytics related to EIP-1559 are always based on the latest Superchain configurations. The change involved updates to the project's dependencies, Helm charts, and core Python data-sourcing logic ([#1750](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1750)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month involved closing out prior investigations and operational tasks.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **`op-node` Architecture:** An issue exploring a potential refactor of the `op-node` CLI, entrypoint, and service components was closed as "not planned," concluding the investigation phase ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16680)).
  - **Alerting:** An issue to improve alerts and runbooks for flashblocks was resolved, with the implementation completed in the `k8s` repository ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17423)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  No new issues were opened, and there were no significant discussions on existing active issues during this period.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Based on the available data, collaboration was evident through cross-repository work. The resolution for the flashblock alert issue ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17423)) was implemented in a separate `k8s` repository, highlighting coordination between different parts of the project's infrastructure.
