# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development focused on enhancing data integrity and operational stability across the Superchain ecosystem. Key efforts included integrating Superchain configuration data directly into the analytics platform, ensuring consistent parameters like `eip1559_elasticity` are used. Significant progress was also made in refining the financial reporting for the Optimism Collective and resolving critical stability issues related to Flashblocks and dispute monitoring. The month was characterized by foundational improvements to data accuracy and the robustness of monitoring tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving data pipelines for both Superchain parameters and Collective economics.

- **Superchain Configuration Integration:** A new feature was implemented to pull `eip1559_elasticity` and `eip1559_denominator` configurations directly from the `superchain-registry`. This change ([#1750](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1750)) ensures that analytics are always based on the canonical configuration, improving data consistency across the ecosystem.

- **Collective Economics Refinements:** Several adjustments were made to improve the accuracy of financial reporting. This included bug fixes in collective balance calculations ([#1755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1755)) and updates to revenue wallet configurations ([#1754](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1754)), contributing to more reliable economic data for the Optimism Collective.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month concentrated on resolving stability problems and making key architectural decisions.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblock Stability:** A cluster of issues related to Flashblocks was successfully resolved. This included fixing problems with lost Flashblocks ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17856)), improving coordination with RPC providers ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17857)), and enhancing associated alerts and runbooks ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17423)).
    - **`op-node` Architecture:** An exploratory issue ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16680)) on refactoring the `op-node` architecture was closed as "not planned," solidifying the decision to maintain the current component structure for the time being.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No major new issues were reported in the provided timeframe.
    - A key ongoing discussion is taking place in [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17814) regarding how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync rollup RPC nodes. The consensus is moving toward using the highest observed L2 block as the current head, which represents important future work to increase the resilience of the dispute monitoring service.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Based on the available data, collaboration this month appeared focused and effective. The resolution of the Flashblock alert issue ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17423)) highlighted cross-repository coordination, with the fix being implemented in the `k8s` repository. Furthermore, the active discussion around `op-dispute-mon` ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17814)) demonstrates proactive problem-solving on critical infrastructure components.
