# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Work in November focused on foundational data maintenance and strategic planning for documentation. Key activities involved updating chain metadata to ensure the accuracy of various analytical and economic tracking tools. Additionally, progress was made in refining the project's issue backlog by closing obsolete items and consolidating future documentation efforts for core protocol features.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The primary technical work involved maintaining the integrity of the project's data sources.

- **Chain Metadata Maintenance:** A series of updates were merged to keep chain metadata files current. This work is crucial for the accuracy of helper functions, OP Chain tracking inputs, and OP Collective economic analysis tools. The changes ensure that downstream data consumers have access to reliable and up-to-date information ([#1762](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1762), [#1761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1761)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month centered on backlog cleanup and planning for future documentation.

- **Closed Issues:** An older issue concerning the reporting of unused acceptance tests was closed ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16273)). This was deemed no longer relevant as the team has largely adopted a "gateless mode" workflow, rendering the original request obsolete.

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened based on the provided reports. However, an important discussion continued on an active issue regarding documentation for the DA Footprint Limit feature ([#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1742)). A suggestion was made to track this work alongside the broader documentation effort for the `MinBaseFee` feature, signaling a move towards consolidating and streamlining documentation tasks for related protocol components.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Based on the available data, collaboration was evident in the strategic planning around documentation. The discussion on issue [#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1742) shows contributors coordinating to improve the efficiency and coherence of documentation efforts, suggesting a collaborative approach to improving resources for developers and users.
