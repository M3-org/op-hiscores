# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
August was a month of significant refinement and expansion for the `op-analytics` project. Development centered on enhancing the integrity and stability of the data pipeline through numerous schema fixes, data quality checks, and targeted data exclusions. A major highlight was the introduction of the comprehensive "jovian analysis" suite, expanding the repository's analytical capabilities. Concurrently, important groundwork was laid for future infrastructure improvements, with active discussions and community engagement around migrating `op-deployer` to Forge and evolving the `op-node`'s sync mechanism.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on improving data pipeline robustness, expanding analytical tooling, and general housekeeping.

*   **Data Pipeline and Schema Integrity**: A series of critical fixes and enhancements were implemented to ensure data accuracy and pipeline stability. This included correcting schema migrations for stablecoins ([#1725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1725)) and l2beat TVS data ([#1730](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1730)). To refine data processing, Celo and Ethereum were excluded from certain model publishing jobs ([#1716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1716), [#1727](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1727)). Data quality checks for account abstraction were also improved by adding regression tests and relaxing checks for failed user operations ([#1732](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1732), [#1738](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1738)). The pipeline's core was updated with a bump to the Dagster dependency ([#1734](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1734), [#1739](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1739)).

*   **Expansion of Analytical Tooling**: The project's analytical capabilities were significantly expanded with the addition of the "jovian analysis" suite ([#1728](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1728)). This new tooling includes scripts for data fetching, core analysis functions, and visualization notebooks for data usage, compression, and gas limit analysis. Existing analytics were also refined, with optimizations to reduce the run time for Dune queries ([#1729](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1729)) and updates to the Jovian analysis notebooks for better presentation ([#1735](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1735), [#1737](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1737)). Additionally, OP Mainnet explorer links were updated across the repository ([#1715](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1715)).

*   **Code and Configuration Cleanup**: Minor but important housekeeping tasks were completed, including removing redundant words from the codebase ([#1726](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1726)) and fixing a duplicate issue in the CircleCI configuration ([#1736](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1736)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in August focused on finalizing protocol specifications, improving infrastructure, and planning for significant future work.

*   **Closed Issues**:
    *   **Protocol Specification**: A major milestone was reached with the finalization and ratification of the min-base-fee specification ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/742)).
    *   **Infrastructure & Testing**: Progress was made on the infrastructure front with the confirmation that flashblocks were successfully enabled on Sunnyside sequencers ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16688)). Several development tasks were also formally deprioritized, including adding challenger support to `op-up` ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17005)) and flashblocks support in Kurtosis ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16514)).
    *   **Cleanup & Process**: A number of cleanup and process-related issues were closed, addressing logging in `op-up` and `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17007), [#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17151)) and internal tracking tickets ([#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/13543), [#17012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17012)).

*   **New & Active Issues**:
    *   **Forge Deployer Migration**: A significant new initiative is the migration of `op-deployer` to use Forge, tracked in [#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17213). This effort has been broken down into several sub-tasks and has already attracted strong community interest.
    *   **Node Sync Mechanism**: A critical architectural discussion is ongoing in [#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/14108) about deprecating the req-resp p2p sync in `op-node` in favor of a simpler, faster alternative to address existing sync problems.
    *   **Flashblocks Monitoring**: Work continues on improving the operational robustness of flashblocks, with active discussions on creating alerts for when a non-flashblocks sequencer becomes active ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16867)) and for low peer counts ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16868)).
    *   **Documentation & CI**: Discussions are active around improving the documentation for `op-deployer` to better support external chain operators ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1530)) and enhancing the CI process for `op-geth` PRs within the monorepo ([#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/665)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
August saw notable collaboration, particularly around future infrastructure development. Community member `tooshiNoko` showed strong initiative by expressing interest in tackling the entire suite of issues related to the `op-deployer` migration to Forge ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17213), [#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17214), etc.), demonstrating healthy external contributor engagement. Furthermore, detailed technical discussions in issues like the `op-node` sync mechanism ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/14108)) and `op-deployer` documentation ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1530)) highlight active problem-solving between core team members and the wider community.
