# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December was a month of critical fixes and emerging challenges, reflecting a strong focus on the stability and accuracy of core infrastructure. Development efforts successfully addressed bugs in the analytics pipeline, correcting revenue and circulating supply calculations. Significant progress was made in hardening the protocol's challenger system, with numerous issues related to ZK proof generation and `op-challenger` robustness being resolved. However, the latter half of the month was dominated by the emergence of critical node synchronization failures affecting multiple chains across the Superchain, alongside a severe panic in `op-challenger`, shifting the team's focus to immediate debugging and system stability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on enhancing data accuracy and accessibility within the analytics pipeline.

- **Analytics & Governance Data Integrity:** Several important bug fixes were merged to ensure the reliability of core economic data. A fix in the collective revenue write process corrected fee calculations ([#1772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1772)), and a separate bug in the circulating supply calculation was resolved to ensure accurate API data retrieval ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1773)).

- **DEX Analytics Expansion:** The DEX trades logic was enhanced to incorporate Solana data into the query pipeline, broadening the scope of cross-chain analytics. The update also refined filtering criteria for daily swaps and volume, improving data precision ([#1770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1770)).

- **Public Goods Funding Data:** To improve data accessibility for RetroPGF analysis, a new pull request was opened to add CSV dumps for Seasons 7 and 8 ([#1774](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1774)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The month saw the resolution of a large batch of challenger-related issues, but concluded with a focus on new, critical bugs affecting node stability across the ecosystem.

- **Closed Issues:** A significant effort to improve the fault-proof system was completed. Key resolutions include deciding to use the succinct proposer for ZK proof generation ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18319)) and implementing support for challenging ZK game types in `op-challenger` ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18321)). Numerous related issues were also closed to improve the `op-challenger`'s configuration and robustness, enhancing test coverage ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18427)) and bond handling ([#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18413), [#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18414)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Critical Node Synchronization Failures:** A major challenge emerged with nodes failing to synchronize across multiple chains, including Base and Optimism ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18468), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581)). Users reported `op-node` getting stuck in EL sync mode and encountering "missing trie node" errors, particularly when using `op-geth`. This has become a high-priority investigation involving community-wide log and configuration gathering.
    - **`op-challenger` Panic:** A critical `nil pointer dereference` was discovered in `op-challenger` ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18608)), causing it to panic when connected to an L1 chain that does not support Dencun blob transactions. This represents a significant stability risk for challengers on certain network configurations.
    - **Protocol Hardening:** Active discussions are underway on several fronts to improve protocol robustness. These include addressing a critical fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2` ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18554)), fixing P2P connection flakiness between `op-reth` and `op-geth` nodes ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18570)), and optimizing ZK proofs by offloading expensive operations ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18533)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly visible this month, particularly in response to the critical issues that arose. The node synchronization problem ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581)) spurred active engagement between node operators and maintainers, with the community providing detailed reports and maintainers coordinating the diagnostic process.

Discussions on active issues like the `op-challenger` panic ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18608)) and interop transaction design ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18574)) showcased collaborative problem-solving among multiple contributors. Notably, contributor `rdin777` played a key role in triaging and driving discussion across a wide range of high-priority issues, demonstrating a proactive approach to maintaining system health and security.
