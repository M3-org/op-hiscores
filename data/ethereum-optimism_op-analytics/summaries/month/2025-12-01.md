# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December's development focused on enhancing data accuracy and advancing the fault-proof system. Key achievements include the integration of Solana data into the DEX analytics pipeline and a critical bug fix in the collective revenue calculation process. Significant progress was made on the `op-challenger`, with numerous issues closed related to ZK proof generation and configuration. However, the team is actively addressing a notable challenge where the `op-node` can get stuck in EL sync mode, impacting node operators on Base Mainnet.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving the analytics pipeline and ensuring the correctness of financial calculations.

- **Analytics & Financial Reporting:**
  - The DEX trades analytics pipeline was enhanced to incorporate Solana data, improving the comprehensiveness of cross-chain trade analysis. The update also refined filtering criteria for daily swaps and volume ([#1770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1770)).
  - A critical bug in the collective revenue write process was fixed, ensuring the accurate calculation and reporting of collective fees within the `op_collective_economics` module ([#1772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1772)).

- **Documentation:**
  - A pull request was opened to update the project's `README.md` file ([#1771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1771)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this period saw a major push to resolve items related to the `op-challenger` while a significant node synchronization issue remains a top priority.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **`op-challenger` Enhancements:** A large batch of issues related to the fault-proof challenger was closed, marking significant progress. This included implementing support for challenging ZK game types ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18321)), formalizing the use of the succinct proposer for ZK proof generation ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18319)), and improving general robustness. The robustness improvements covered test coverage ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18427)), configuration for reading from the DGF registry ([#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18412)), and more reliable handling of challenger bonds and addresses ([#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18413), [#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18414), [#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18415)).
  - **Documentation:** An issue regarding documentation for the consensus layer sync path was closed ([#1895](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1895)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were opened during this period.
  - **`op-node` Sync Bug:** The most critical active issue is [#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18468), where `op-node` gets stuck in an EL sync loop after a restart, even when the execution client has synced data. This is actively impacting node operators on Base Mainnet. A temporary workaround involving a switch to CL sync mode has been suggested while a permanent fix is investigated.
  - **Future Work:** Discussions are ongoing for writing acceptance tests for new EIPs ([#18221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18221)) and cleaning up unused OP constants ([#13440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/13440)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident in community-driven troubleshooting, particularly around the `op-node` sync issue ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18468)). Users provided reports from Base Mainnet and shared temporary workarounds, demonstrating active engagement in identifying and mitigating problems. Internally, the closure of a large, related set of issues concerning the `op-challenger` indicates a coordinated and focused development effort on advancing the project's fault-proof capabilities.
