# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Jun 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a minor update to the `other_chains_tracking` notebook for transaction runs. Discussions on active issues revolved around supervisor reset behavior, L1 origin validity, and `op-geth` CPU usage.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Analytics Notebook Updates
*   A modification was made to the `get_all_txs.ipynb` notebook within the `other_chains_tracking` area, likely to refine transaction data retrieval or processing ([#1662](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1662)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Supervisor Event Investigation
*   An issue was opened to investigate spikes of `local-derived` and other events in `op-supervisor`, suggesting potential congestion or deadlocks ([#16603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16603)).

### Dependency Resolution
*   A bug was reported regarding a broken dependency, `github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39`, in `op-chain-ops`, with a note on a potential fork being used ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16612)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Supervisor Reset and L1 Origin Handling
Discussions continued on improving `op-supervisor`'s reset behavior and L1 origin validity handling. For [#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16314) (Improve reset unsafe target), a partial implementation was noted, focusing on the supervisor providing correct reset targets, but lacking full L1 origin validation across all safety levels. The issue was later closed on July 25th, with a note that actionable items were covered and a refactor is planned. Similarly, for [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16315) (Improve L1 origin validity handling during resets), it was highlighted that while an L1 origin verifier exists, it's currently only used for local unsafe heads, not other safety levels. The discussion emphasized that all supervisor-provided targets should be valid to avoid duplicating checks on the `op-node`. For [#16321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16321) (Improve reorg during reset behavior), the current status indicates that local unsafe head L1 origin is checked at the supervisor side before sending reset requests, but L1 origin validity for other safety levels is not yet checked.

### Abnormal CPU Usage in op-geth
The issue of abnormal CPU usage with `op-geth` v1.101511.0 ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/613)) remained active. A user confirmed experiencing the same performance issue and provided a `pprof` file, noting that the issue might be related to an index update taking a significant amount of time. Another user suggested that the high CPU usage is temporary due to a log indexing rebuild in the backported `go-ethereum` v1.15.11, and should normalize once completed. There was also a request for command-line arguments to generate `pprof` data for further analysis.
