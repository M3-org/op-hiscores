## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI Flakiness Investigation
Discussions on [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16271) continued regarding the investigation and improvement of CI flakiness. The latest comments from scharissis on June 9th highlighted that most flakiness is due to infrastructure issues (e.g., CircleCI machine issues, networking) rather than acceptance testing itself. A list of the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests was also provided.

### L1 Origin Validity in op-supervisor Resets
Issue [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16315) concerning the `op-supervisor`'s handling of L1 origin validity during resets saw comments from sebastianst on June 9th. The discussion centered on whether the supervisor should perform walkbacks or if all targets provided by the supervisor should inherently be valid. It was suggested that if targets are invalid, the supervisor should realize the L1 chain changed and provide another reset, reducing complexity.

### Incorrect Nonce from eth_getTransactionCount
The issue [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/623), reporting an incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) from `eth_getTransactionCount` for pending transactions, received a comment from ntrzr on June 9th, requesting someone to look into the problem.

### Superchain Interop Environment Quickstart Guide
Discussions on [#1644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1644) focused on creating a quickstart guide for the Superchain Interop environment. On June 9th, sbvegan noted that this content would be suitable for a homepage and that further exploration with a wider lens is planned. krofax also committed to drafting content by the following day.

### Complete Withdrawal Flow Test
Issue [#327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/327), tracking the "Complete Withdrawal Flow Test," saw an update from serpixel on June 9th. It was noted that the test has been implemented using `sysgo` ([#16333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16333)), with two follow-up tickets needed: adding `kt` (sysext) support and implementing a withdrawal execution without proof generation (devnet).
