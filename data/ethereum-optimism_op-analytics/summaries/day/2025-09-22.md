### op-test-sequencer: add to devnet env and kurtosis [#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15265)
This issue was closed today. The latest comment from janjakubnanista indicates that the issue is being closed because the team is moving away from `kurtosis`. Previously, emhane noted that this was required for running reorg tests in the `kona-supervisor` devstack environment. ajsutton had re-opened the issue due to a todo in the code, after teddyknox had initially deprioritized it pending use-cases for testing with `sysgo`.

### ChainConfig.BlobConfig always uses default configs [#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/685)
This issue was closed today. The latest comment from geoknee confirms that the issue was fixed upstream and should be resolved with the next upstream merge. The issue highlighted that `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` was not correctly using the receiver `c`, indicating an upstream configuration bug that was subsequently addressed in a Go-Ethereum pull request.
