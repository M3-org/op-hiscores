# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Nov 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, development focused on updating chain metadata, with a new pull request opened for further modifications. An old issue regarding unused acceptance tests was closed, while discussions continued on documentation for DA Footprint Limit.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Chain Metadata Updates
A pull request was opened to modify chain metadata, impacting `helper_functions/opstack_metadata_utils.py`, `op_chains_tracking/inputs/chain_metadata_raw.csv`, `op_chains_tracking/inputs/clean_chain_metadata_and_upload.ipynb`, and `op_chains_tracking/outputs/chain_metadata.csv` ([#1761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1761)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#1762](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1762), was opened to modify chain metadata.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Reporting
The issue concerning reporting unused acceptance tests was closed ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16273)). The decision was made as the team has switched to primarily using gateless mode, rendering the issue no longer relevant.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Documentation
Discussions continued on the documentation for the DA Footprint Limit ([#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1742)). The latest comment suggests that this issue could be tracked alongside the documentation for the MinBaseFee feature, noting its self-explanatory nature. The documentation should emphasize the risks of setting the scalar too high (excluding too much traffic) or too low (ineffective protection against spam or DA backlogs).
