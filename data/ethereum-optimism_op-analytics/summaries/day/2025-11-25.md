# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Nov 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing analytical capabilities with a new fee market analysis tool and critical security updates through secret rotation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Fee Market Analysis Tooling:** Initial analysis for the EIP-1559 base fee market was added, including a notebook, core EIP-1559 script, helper functions, and configuration. This tool can model the next block's expected base fee from prior block's gas usage. ([#1768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1768))
*   **Security Secret Rotation:** Secrets for authentication updates were rotated in the `helm/dagster` and `k8s` configurations. ([#1769](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1769))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Sequencer Recover Mode Bug Investigation:** Discussions continued on a possible bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recover mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18350)). The latest comments indicate that when the sequencer is in recover mode but the chain is healthy, it might request an L1 origin block that doesn't yet exist, leading to "not found" errors and a failure to advance the L1 origin. This can violate the sequencer drift rule. A potential fix snippet was proposed to prevent temporary errors in recovery mode when it reaches the tip. Further investigation is ongoing to understand why temporary errors persist and if async L1 origin fetching might be influencing this behavior.
