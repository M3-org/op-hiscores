# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Nov 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on infrastructure maintenance with a secret rotation and the addition of initial analysis for the EIP-1559 base fee market.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Infrastructure Security Update**
    *   Secrets for authentication were rotated to enhance security. ([#1769](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1769))

*   **EIP-1559 Fee Market Analysis**
    *   Initial analysis for the EIP-1559 base fee market was added, including a notebook, core EIP-1559 script, helper functions, and configuration. ([#1768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1768))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Sequencer Recover Mode Bug Investigation** ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18350))
    *   Discussion continues regarding a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recover mode, specifically when it's enabled during normal operation.
    *   The core issue appears to be that the sequencer, while in recover mode, requests an L1 origin block that doesn't yet exist, leading to "not found" errors and preventing the L1 origin from advancing. This can violate the sequencer drift rule.
    *   A possible fix snippet was proposed to prevent temporary errors in recovery mode when it reaches the tip.
    *   Further investigation is ongoing to understand why temporary errors persist and if asynchronous L1 origin fetching (from a recent PR) might be influencing this behavior.
