# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Jul 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant activity in dependency updates and data pipeline refinements, including a fix for DefiLlama notebooks and adjustments to L2 priority fee calculations. Several bumps to Dagster and refined transaction models were also implemented.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Data Pipeline Refinements
- Fixed discrepancies in L2 priority fee calculations, aiming for no difference between calculated and actual fees ([#1704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1704)).
- Addressed a bug in the DefiLlama full backfills notebook ([#1705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1705)).

### Dependency and Model Updates
- Bumped the Dagster version in `Makefile` and `helm/dagster/values.yaml` ([#1708](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1708), [#1710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1710)).
- Updated refined transaction models, impacting `Makefile`, `helm/dagster/values.yaml`, and `src/op_analytics/cli/subcommands/chains/app.py` ([#1709](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1709)).

### Infrastructure and Tooling
- Implemented changes related to CircleCI pushes, affecting `helper_functions/opstack_metadata_utils.py` and `op_chains_tracking` notebooks ([#1707](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1707)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#1706](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1706): "Chain metadata aggregator PR3 - Loaders" was opened, indicating ongoing work on chain metadata aggregation.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Runbook Finalization
- The "Runbook v3 final review" issue ([#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16651)) was closed after a final review. References from other runbooks were updated to point to V3, and the three versions of the runbook were renamed to clearly indicate which upgrade versions they cover (v1 = pre-OPCM; v2 = U14 & U15; v3 = U16+), with each linking to the others.

### Interop SuperSystem Configuration
- The issue "op-e2e: Configurable DA type for interop SuperSystem" ([#15406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15406)) was closed. However, it was noted that it was closed incorrectly due to automation and was subsequently reopened.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **op-e2e: Configurable DA type for interop SuperSystem** ([#15406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15406)): This issue was briefly closed due to automation but was immediately reopened. The discussion highlights the need for a batcher that posts using blobs for interop FP testing, rather than calldata. Previous comments questioned its relevance for RC Beta and suggested using `op-devstack` instead of `SuperSystem` or `interopgen`. The latest comment confirms the incorrect closure and reopening of the issue.
