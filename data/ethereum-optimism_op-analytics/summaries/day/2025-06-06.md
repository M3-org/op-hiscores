## NEW ISSUES
### Supervisor L1 Origin Validity
A new issue was opened to improve the `op-supervisor`'s handling of L1 origin validity during resets. The current reset logic only checks consistency between local and node safe databases, lacking a check for the canonical L1 origin of the target. Discussions suggest that all targets provided by the supervisor should be valid, and if not, the supervisor should realize the L1 chain changed and provide another reset target, reducing complexity and back-and-forth with the `op-node`.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Fault Proof Data Provision for Non-Genesis Interop
Discussions continued on fixing the `op-supervisor`'s ability to provide data for fault proofs with non-genesis interop. The `op-challenger` currently struggles with non-genesis activation blocks. One proposed solution involves the `op-challenger` manually constructing pre-interop super roots from rollup nodes or via the supervisor. Another option, currently being implemented, suggests indexing the safe DB in the supervisor from the first derived block, even if pre-Interop, to serve super roots consistently. The issue's title was updated to clarify that the fix is needed in `op-supervisor`, as the fault proof side lacks the necessary information. The importance of fixing this before moving to devnets was emphasized. [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16166)

### Incorrect Nonce from eth_getTransactionCount
A user reported that `eth_getTransactionCount` returned an incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending transactions on a Base node, causing transactions to get stuck in the mempool. The user requested an update on the issue. [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/623)
