# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Jul 1, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes for ETH transfers, enhancements to collective balance retrieval with retry logic, and updates to fee split calculations. Several internal tooling improvements were also made, including a Dagster version bump function and enabling Dagster backfill for ETH transfers.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Data Pipeline Enhancements & Bug Fixes
A significant bug affecting ETH transfers was resolved, specifically addressing issues where entries with null `value_64` were being dropped ([#1665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1665)). Additionally, retry logic was implemented for collective balances to prevent null issues during retrieval ([#1663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1663)).

### Collective Economics & Fee Split Updates
The process for updating fee splits was improved by adding new entities (Uni, Sony) and transitioning to reading data from RPCs instead of Etherscan APIs ([#1664](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1664)).

### Internal Tooling & Automation
New functionality was introduced to automate the bumping of the Dagster version via a CLI-runnable function ([#1666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1666)). Furthermore, Dagster backfill was enabled for ETH transfers, improving data processing capabilities ([#1667](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1667)).
