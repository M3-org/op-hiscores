# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Jun 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw no new code contributions, but significant discussions continued on several active issues, particularly concerning op-node stability, supervisor event handling, and release pipeline improvements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Data Availability Error Handling
A new issue was opened to address missing Super DA Errors, specifically to add error codes for data availability errors caused by reorgs, which are currently missing from the specification but present in the Go implementation [#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/725).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Interoperability Prestate Checks
Discussion continued on [#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15765) regarding checking the EL prestate for pre-interop CrossL2Inbox configuration faults. Ajsutton commented that the execution client is not well-suited for this validation due to dependency and world state availability issues. They argued that the genesis generation tooling (op-deployer) already mitigates this risk by correctly deciding CrossL2Inbox inclusion based on the number of chains and interop activation, suggesting the problem is solved in tooling rather than requiring added complexity in op-geth/op-reth.

### Release Pipeline Automation
Comments on [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16097) focused on using GoReleaser for op-node/batcher/proposer/challenger release pipelines. Geoknee suggested a lighter-weight solution for changelog generation using `git cliff` and emphasized the desire for a one-click solution for high-quality, consistent changelogs, ideally committed to the codebase.

### op-node Goroutine Leaks
Issue [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16332) saw a new comment from Creamers158, confirming they are experiencing the same issue with thousands of stuck goroutines in `p2p.SyncClient / libp2p` on `op-node v1.13.3`, providing a stack trace similar to the original report.

### op-supervisor Event Overflow
Discussion on [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16335) continued regarding the supervisor's event overflow on large unsafe head gaps. Sebastianst clarified their previous comment, stating that while `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` was initially suspected, it's likely the `"cross-unsafe-update"` events that are accumulating. Nonsense is working on adding a counter per event type to help debug future occurrences, noting that `ChainIndexingContinueEvents` are likely not the culprit as they are emitted and consumed 1:1.

### Acceptance Test Devnet Progress
Serpixel commented on [#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/398), confirming the addition of L1 Faucet support to aid in getting all acceptance tests running and passing in persistent devnets.

### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet
Tremarkley provided a clarification on [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/399), explaining that supersim is a lighter-weight wrapper around Anvil, primarily used for local development and testing multichain/interop applications, in contrast to Kurtosis which is used by the OP Stack for chain testing.
