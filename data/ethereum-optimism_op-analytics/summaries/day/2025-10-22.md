# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining data inputs for chain tracking and collective economics, alongside significant progress in closing out several long-standing issues related to development tooling, validation processes, and Jovian upgrade finalization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Ecosystem Data Refinements
Updates were made to the chain metadata to include an "EC Ecosystem" column, approximating ecosystem data via crypto-ecosystems.xyz, and a change to a development report column. These changes enhance the tracking and analysis of chains within the Superchain ecosystem.
- [#1757](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1757)
- [#1756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1756)

### Optimism Collective Economics Data Handling
A specific adjustment was implemented to handle scenarios with zero inflight ETH in the collective net revenue balances, ensuring robust data processing for economic analysis.
- [#1758](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1758)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Development Tooling and Infrastructure Deprecation
Several issues related to development tooling, specifically Kurtosis and a Sepolia ETH faucet, were closed due to shifts in development focus and strategy. The Kurtosis issue was closed as investment in the tool ceased, and the Sepolia ETH faucet issue was closed as the team moves away from Discord for such requests.

- [#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/12952)

### Validation Process Streamlining
Issues concerning chain validation on PRs and genesis validation checks for frontier chains were closed. These changes reflect a move towards a report-based approach for chain validation rather than blocking validations, aiming to reduce overhead and streamline processes.

- [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/696)

### Jovian Upgrade Finalization
Two issues related to the Jovian upgrade were finalized and closed. This included updating the upgrade transactions' bytecode and settling on a default value for `daFootprintGasScalar`, marking significant progress in the upgrade's implementation.
- [#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/772)
- [#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/773)

### Interopgen Configuration
An issue regarding rewiring interopgen configuration was closed as "won't fix." The decision was made because interopgen is primarily used by `op-e2e`, and new tests are now being added as acceptance tests, negating the need for further configuration changes.
- [#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17614)

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Investigation
Issue [#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17946) is actively being investigated to understand why the block right after genesis still exhibits a 0 gas scalar. The latest comment indicates that the root cause has been identified: the way the first block's L1 block attributes were populated from the genesis SystemConfig, which could have a 0 scalar that wasn't translated. A fix has been implemented in PR #17947.

### OPCMStandardValidator Update for Dispute Game Contracts
Issue [#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17267) concerns updating the `OPContractsManagerStandardValidator` to handle new dispute game contracts, specifically for version 2 where some data is no longer accessible. The issue was initially closed but has been reopened because tests are still being skipped when V2 is enabled, indicating that the problem is not fully resolved despite previous work.
