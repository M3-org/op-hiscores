# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on minor adjustments to data handling and chain metadata within the `op-analytics` repository. Several long-standing issues related to development tooling, validation processes, and Jovian upgrade specifications were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Data Handling and Chain Metadata Updates
Adjustments were made to how inflight ETH is handled in collective economics analysis, specifically addressing scenarios with zero inflight ETH. Additionally, updates were applied to chain metadata, including a change to a developer report column and the addition of an ecosystem column.
- handle for 0 inflight eth ([#1758](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1758))
- change dev report column ([#1757](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1757))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Deprecated Development Tooling and Validation Processes
Several issues related to development tooling and validation processes were closed, reflecting a shift in strategy towards report-based approaches and away from specific tools like Kurtosis.
- Add a Sepolia ETH faucet to the Protocol R&D Discord ([#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/12952))
- kurtosis: Ability to use local op-geth build ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16975))
- Validate all chains on PRs which modify the validation test code / expectations ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/689))
- Do not run genesis validation checks for frontier chains ([#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/696))

### Jovian Upgrade Specification Finalization
Issues concerning the Jovian upgrade transactions and `daFootprintGasScalar` default value were closed, indicating the finalization of these specifications.
- Update the Jovian upgrade transactions' bytecode when finalized ([#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/772))
- Update the Jovian `daFootprintGasScalar` default value when finalized ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/773))

### Interopgen Configuration and Dispute Game Contracts
An issue related to rewiring interopgen configuration was closed as "won't fix" due to its limited use. An issue regarding updating `OPCMStandardValidator` for new dispute game contracts was reopened after initial closure, as tests remain skipped.
- Rewire interopgen config ([#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17614))
- Update OPCMStandardValidator to handle new dispute game contracts ([#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17267))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Investigation
The issue [#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17946) is investigating why the block right after genesis still has a 0 gas scalar. The latest comment from `sebastianst` confirms that the issue has been found, attributing it to how the first block's L1 block attributes were populated from the genesis SystemConfig, which may have had a 0 scalar that was not translated. A fix has been implemented in PR #17947.
