# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Sep 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a dependency bump for Dagster, alongside the closure of several issues related to `min-base-fee` implementation and an issue concerning `op-nat` in Kurtosis. Discussions also continued on a large genesis file issue and the explicit configuration of Superchain chain configs.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dagster Dependency Update
A dependency bump for Dagster was implemented, affecting the `Makefile` and `helm/dagster/values.yaml` files. This update ensures the project utilizes the latest Dagster version. ([#1743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1743))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Min-Base-Fee Implementation Issues Resolved
Several issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature were closed, indicating progress in its implementation. These include adding `minBaseFee` to the block header's `extraData` field ([#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/649)), adding an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3` ([#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/650)), and updating `eip1559.CalcBaseFee` to enforce the minimum if the feature is active ([#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/651)). All were closed via a related `op-geth` pull request.

### Op-Nat Kurtosis Integration Deprioritized
The issue concerning running `op-nat` in Kurtosis was closed, with the rationale that other local devnet environments are now being prioritized. ([#158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/158))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Large Genesis File and LevelDB Panic
Discussion continued on an issue where initializing `op-geth` with a large genesis file leads to a LevelDB panic ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/668)). The latest comment suggests that the Genesis-State-Spec is optional and does not need to be stored in `geth`. It recommends modifying `op-geth` for a one-time state import by not storing the alloc data as a flat JSON blob and including the `stateHash` attribute of the genesis block into the chain-`config` part of `genesis.json`. This approach allows fresh nodes to start with an empty DB but a valid genesis-block header, enabling snap-sync from other bootstrap nodes, similar to how op-mainnet operates.

### Superchain Chain Configs Explicit
An ongoing issue regarding making Superchain chain configurations fully explicit is under discussion ([#763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/763)). The latest comment questions whether chain configs are already self-descriptive and if the issue can be closed.
