# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Aug 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on integrating new analytical capabilities with the addition of "jovian analysis" to the repository. Discussions on active issues revolved around improving CI processes for `op-geth` PRs and enhancing documentation for `op-deployer`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Analytical Tooling Expansion
A significant addition was made to the repository with the integration of "jovian analysis" ([#1728](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1728)). This involved adding numerous files related to data fetching, configuration, core analysis functions, and visualization, primarily within the `notebooks/adhoc/jovian_analysis` directory. This new analysis capability includes:
- Core Python scripts for analysis functions, chain configuration, ClickHouse data fetching, and constants.
- Jupyter notebooks for ad-hoc analysis, including `jovian_analysis.ipynb` and `da_throttling_analysis.ipynb`.
- Pre-generated HTML outputs and result images from various analysis runs, indicating a robust set of analytical tools for data usage, compression, and gas limit analysis.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI Enhancements for Monorepo
Discussion on [#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/665) centered on improving the Continuous Integration (CI) process for `op-geth` PRs within the monorepo. The latest comment from ajsutton suggests an alternative: a periodic job in the monorepo to check for the latest `op-geth` commit from the optimism branch. This job would notify via Slack if it fails, aiming to quickly alert developers to potential issues, even if it doesn't prevent them. The main concern raised is the possibility of false alarms if the job runs between an `op-geth` PR merging and its corresponding monorepo PR merging.

### Documentation for `op-deployer`
The ongoing discussion in [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1530) focuses on enhancing the documentation for creating an OP Stack Rollup testnet using `op-deployer`. The most recent comment from krofax highlights a "rich PR" ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705/](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705/)) that overhauls the existing documentation. Earlier comments from Visheshgpt and Chomtana pointed out issues with high RPC call volumes when using the permissioned fault-proof system and the confusion caused by mixed old and new deployment methods in the documentation, respectively. seromenho inquired about potential issues with deploying a chain with permissioned fault proofs, and sbvegan clarified that `op-deployer` currently only deploys the permissioned dispute game (game type 1) with a placeholder for the absolute prestate hash, noting a circular dependency. Hakkmihakim also linked to the issue. The overall sentiment is a strong need for clearer, updated documentation for `op-deployer` to facilitate external chain operators.
