# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Sep 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on adding new chain analysis output, including updated gas limit data and various analytical plots for several chains. Discussions on active issues covered CI/CD improvements, P2P gossip configuration, and Kona/Cannon integration.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Chain Analysis Output Updates
New chain analysis output was added, including updated gas limit data for Ink, Mode, Soneium, Unichain, and Worldchain. This update also included new analytical plots and an updated README for the `jovian_analysis` notebook. ([#1740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1740))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI/CD and Developer Experience Improvements
Discussions continued on improving the UX and testability of the CircleCI configuration ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17184)). Key points included identifying high-value CI jobs for local execution (e.g., `kurtosis` and `go-tests-short`), addressing friction from prerequisite setup steps, and exploring the automation of CircleCI config validation. There was also an interesting idea about dynamically sorting Go tests by execution time to optimize local test runs and potentially move longer tests to post-merge CI.

### P2P Gossip Configuration Bug
A bug was reported regarding `ConfigureGossip` overwriting sane defaults with zero values in the `op-node/p2p/gossip` module ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17308)). The discussion clarified that a configuration with zero values for certain parameters (like `Dhi`) is invalid and can lead to panics in `go-libp2p-pubsub`. Potential solutions discussed included adding a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to return a fully valid configuration with sensible defaults, or modifying the current setup to handle zero values more robustly.

### Kona + Cannon Integration
Discussions around Kona and Cannon integration continued across multiple issues. For OPCM support ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17285)), the focus was on ensuring OPCM can deploy the new game type, specifically updating the relevant `if` block in `OPContractsManager.sol`. For standard prestates integration ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17283)), the conversation centered on how to represent the new `cannon-kona` type in `standard-prestates.toml`, with a suggestion to use `type = "cannon-kona"` and a new hash.

### Sync Tester Enhancements
The issue for adding sync acceptance tests using the sync tester ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16703)) was reopened. The latest comments highlighted the need to test every OP Stack Hard Fork transition, not just Isthmus, and suggested ideas for future test cases, such as multiple CLs with a single sync tester and user transactions within L2 blocks.

### Go 1.25 Compatibility
The issue concerning Cannon's compatibility with Go 1.25 ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17060)) noted the release of Go 1.25.1. However, it was pointed out that this release does not appear to include the MIPS fix, which might still be a concern.
