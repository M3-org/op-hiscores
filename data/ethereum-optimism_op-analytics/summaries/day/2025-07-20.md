## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on addressing data pipeline issues, specifically excluding Ethereum from Goldsky temporarily and reordering schema columns to maintain data integrity.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Data Pipeline Adjustments
Efforts were made to temporarily exclude Ethereum from Goldsky due to downstream blockbatch model failures after ingestion, indicating a need for rollback on an existing change. This also involved reordering schema columns to align with expected structures.
