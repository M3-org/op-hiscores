## NEW ISSUES

### Jovian Data Quality Check Modification
A new issue was created to modify the ingestion data quality check for Jovian, specifically to ensure that block gas used equals the sum of transaction gas used for all transactions in a block, and for Jovian, to sum `max(tx gas used, da footprint)`. ([#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1742))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Configuration
Discussions continued on several flashblocks-related issues. For [#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16759) (enable flashblocks on prod-mainnet-op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-0), updates included associated PRs for k8s and remaining tasks such as deploying rollup-boost with disabled mode and then enabling its execution mode. Similarly, for [#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16761) (enable flashblocks on sunnyside sequencers), the latest updates confirmed both sunnyside sequencers have op-rbuilder deployed and synced, with next steps involving rollup-boost deployment and enabling execution mode. The issue [#16763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16763) (deploy flashblocks-websocket-proxy) is currently blocked on the availability of websocket connection of conductors, but a PR is in progress. For [#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16764) (deploy flashblocks-rpc node), there's a need to confirm its necessity. The issue [#17162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17162) (Close out Flashblocks spec) noted associated PRs for the specs. Finally, [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17317) (enable flashblocks on op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-1 mainnet) outlined associated PRs and remaining work to deploy and enable rollup-boost.

### op-node/p2p/gossip Configuration Bug
Discussion on [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17308) (ConfigureGossip overwrites sane defaults with zero values) revolved around a bug where `ConfigureGossip` was overwriting sane defaults with zero values, leading to panics in `go-libp2p-pubsub` tests. The conversation explored whether to make invalid configs work or to introduce a `DefaultP2PConfig` method for valid defaults.

### op-geth Initialization Error
Issue [#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/420) (op-geth init gives "head block is not reachable" error) saw a new comment from `cliff0412` indicating they also encountered the error. Previous comments suggested continuing with setup as the error might not be critical, or that re-running the init command could resolve it.

### Sync-Tester Network Exposure
On [#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/454) ([sync-tester] Expose More Networks inside CI Box), `jelias2` provided an update on exposing L2 ELs in CI for mainnet and sepolia on various networks (unichain, ink, base). The remaining task is to expose an L1 beacon API in CI. `jelias2` also mentioned modifying the synctest to be more dynamic with environment variables and provided a draft PR for review.
