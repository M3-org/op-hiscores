# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Jul 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the Revshare transfer logic within op-analytics, including expanding support for all inbound transfers and fixing an insert logic bug. This work improves data accuracy and broadens the scope of transfer tracking.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Revshare Transfer Logic
Significant updates were made to the Revshare transfer logic to improve its comprehensiveness and accuracy. This includes expanding the system to capture all inbound transfers, using a boolean flag to distinguish between known revshare addresses and other inbound transfers, which aids in identifying unmapped addresses. The update also refined how the system handles known revshare transfers.

### Cross-Chain Revshare Support
Revshare transfer support has been extended to include all chains, ensuring broader applicability and data collection across the Superchain ecosystem.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Interoperability Configuration Validation
Issue [#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15765), concerning the validation of CrossL2Inbox configuration in the L2 genesis state for pre-interop chains, has been closed. The discussion concluded that the execution client is not the ideal place for this validation, and the risk has been mitigated through improvements in the genesis generation tooling (op-deployer).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Interoperability Configuration Validation
Issue [#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15765) was closed today. The latest comments from ajsutton indicate that the execution client is not well-suited for validating the presence of the CrossL2Inbox in the L2 genesis state. It was argued that adding this check would introduce unnecessary complexity to `op-geth`/`op-reth`. Instead, the risk of incorrect genesis generation has been mitigated by improvements in the `op-deployer` tool, which now correctly determines whether the CrossL2Inbox should be included based on the number of chains and interop activation. The conclusion is that the problem has been solved at the tooling level, making a client-side check redundant.
