## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Documentation
Flashblocks were successfully enabled live on op-mainnet, with a detailed status provided by the `op-conductor-ops` tool, showing several sequencers with Flashblocks enabled ([#16498](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16498)). Additionally, an on-call onboarding session and revision for Flashblocks were completed, including a presentation and documentation ([#17142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17142)). A blog post diving deep into the Flashblocks deployment, learnings, and improvements for mainnet was also written and published ([#17664](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17664)).

### EL Sync Correctness
An issue regarding synchronization in the op-node's EL sync code path was closed. The fix, which involved proper locking and was tested with an amplified race window, has been merged and appears to resolve the problem. The discussion suggests that enabling a race detector might be beneficial for future implementations ([#17564](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17564)).
