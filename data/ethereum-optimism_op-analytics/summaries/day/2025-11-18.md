## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop and Sync-Start Awareness

The issue highlights the need for op-node's sync-start algorithm to be aware of Interop activation.

### Supervisor Multi-Node Support and Backward Compatibility
- Issue [#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16174) ("op-supervisor: Drop multi-node support") was reopened by ajsutton due to an existing TODO referencing it. The issue discusses dropping multi-node support in the supervisor.
- Issue [#16245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16245) ("op-supervisor: remove check-access-list backward compat chainID fallback") was reopened by ajsutton, citing outstanding TODOs. This issue pertains to removing backward compatibility for chainID fallback in the op-supervisor.

### Event System Refactor Cleanup
- Issue [#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16917) ("Clean up Event System Refactor Comments") was reopened by ajsutton, indicating that several TODOs related to the event system refactor still need to be addressed.

### Deprecating Request/Response Sync
- Issue [#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17631) ("op-node: On the Initial EL Sync UX and Correctness") received a comment from mslipper, suggesting it should be addressed once Request/Response sync is fully deprecated. The issue discusses potential problems with op-node marking blocks as finalized during initial EL sync even if they are not truly finalized.
- Issue [#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18124) ("op-node: Safe Head Advancement during EL Sync") was commented on by mslipper, who suggested punting it until Request/Response sync is fully deprecated. This issue tracks a potential problem with safe head advancement during EL sync.
- Issue [#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18125) ("op-node: Unsafe not rewound while `INVALID` during EL Sync") also received a comment from mslipper, recommending it be punted until Request/Response sync is fully deprecated. This issue tracks a potential problem where the unsafe head is not rewound during EL sync when invalid.

### Fusaka-on-L2 Design Finalization
- Issue [#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/355) ("fusaka-on-l2: finalize design") received a comment from mslipper, stating that the design will be finalized after checking with customers.
