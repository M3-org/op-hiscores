# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Nov 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a reduction in runs for `other_chains_tracking` scripts. Several long-standing issues related to `op-devstack`, `op-supervisor`, and `Interop` were reopened due to outstanding TODOs, while other issues concerning `add-chain` tooling and CI validation were closed as addressed by SCR 2.0. Discussions continued on `op-node` sync and unsafe head advancement issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Analytics Script Optimization
- Reduced the number of runs for `get_desybil_wallets.ipynb` and `get_qualified_txs.ipynb` within the `other_chains_tracking` area, indicating an effort to streamline data processing or resource usage. ([#1765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1765))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interoperability and Syncing Challenges
- **op-devstack: sysext: fix address book** ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15817)): The issue was reopened by ajsutton, noting that there are still several TODOs related to updating the hardcoded address keys in `sysext`'s address book, despite mslipper previously closing it due to KT being deprecated.
- **Interop: Remove anchor point RPC** ([#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16140)): Reopened by ajsutton due to remaining TODOs, indicating that the anchor block RPC, though no longer used, still has related cleanup tasks.
- **op-node: Let sync-start not cross into Interop activation** ([#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16141)): Reopened by ajsutton, citing a remaining TODO. The discussion highlights the need for op-node's sync-start algorithm to be aware of Interop activation to correctly handle pre-Interop resets.
- **op-supervisor: Drop multi-node support** ([#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16174)): Reopened by ajsutton due to a referencing TODO. The issue concerns the supervisor's multi-node support, which was previously considered for removal or reintroduction.
- **op-supervisor: remove check-access-list backward compat chainID fallback** ([#16245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16245)): Reopened by ajsutton due to outstanding TODOs. This issue tracks the removal of a backward compatibility fallback in the op-supervisor's access-list check.
- **Clean up Event System Refactor Comments** ([#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16917)): Reopened by ajsutton, indicating that numerous TODOs remain for cleaning up comments related to the event system refactor.
- **op-node: On the Initial EL Sync UX and Correctness** ([#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17631)): mslipper commented that this issue, concerning op-node marking a block as finalized during initial EL Sync even if not truly finalized, should be addressed once req/res sync is fully deprecated. pcw109550 previously observed an edge case where `syncStatusFinishedELButNotFinalized` state transition might be missed.
- **op-node: Safe Head Advancement during EL Sync** ([#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18124)): mslipper suggested punting this issue until the full deprecation of RR sync, as it relates to a potential issue found during the deprecation process.
- **op-node: Unsafe not rewound while `INVALID` during EL Sync** ([#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18125)): Similar to the previous issue, mslipper recommended deferring this until RR sync is fully deprecated, as it also stems from observations during the RR sync deprecation efforts.
- **fusaka-on-l2: finalize design** ([#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/355)): mslipper commented that the design finalization will occur after checking with customers.
