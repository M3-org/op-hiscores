# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Jul 15, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on a critical fix to the provider mapping logic within the `op-analytics` codebase, ensuring correct string generation for BigQuery insertions. Additionally, several issues were closed, including discussions around sequencer configurations and a long-standing bug related to invalid transaction inclusion.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

- **Data Source Correction**: A critical fix was implemented to ensure the `provider` field in BigQuery insertions always generates a correct string, resolving an issue with the `providers to provider map`. ([#1691](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1691))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

- **Sequencer Configuration Discussions Concluded**: Several discussions regarding sequencer configurations were closed. This includes the decision to deprioritize enabling flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers in favor of stabilizing flashblocks on OP Labs Sepolia infra ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16688)), and the decision to skip NVMe node deployments for `op-rbuilders` for now, based on current performance observations ([#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16689)). The need for dedicated namespacing for `rbuilders` was also discussed and it was decided to keep them in the same namespace as other sequencer components, opting for additional labels for monitoring and alerting instead ([#16690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16690)).
- **Duplicate Code Identified**: An issue regarding duplicate code in `op-batcher`'s `checkTxpool` function was closed, with a suggestion for a PR to address it. ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16677))
- **Acceptance Test Porting Completed**: The task to port `TestChainFork` to `devstack` was closed, indicating its successful implementation. ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/413))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Txpool: Invalid Interop Tx Conditionally Included**: Discussions continue on the flakiness of invalid interop transactions being conditionally included in the txpool ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/635)). @axelKingsley is actively investigating, attempting to reproduce the bug by running tests on repeat and analyzing `geth`'s transaction addition flow. Despite extensive tracing, no clear branching logic allowing invalid transactions to bypass filters has been found. @pcw109550 provided detailed artifacts and reproduction steps from CI runs where the issue was observed, including logs showing invalid transactions being inserted and sometimes getting stuck in the mempool.
