# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Aug 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining data quality checks for account abstraction, updating explorer links, and improving analysis notebooks. A key specification for min-base-fee was also finalized.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Data Quality and Testing Enhancements
Significant work was done to improve the robustness of data quality checks, particularly for account abstraction. This included adding a regression test for reverted account abstraction user operations and relaxing data quality checks to ignore missing traces for failed user operations ([#1732](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1732), [#1738](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1738)).

### Infrastructure and Dependency Updates
Core infrastructure saw updates with a bump to the Dagster dependency, ensuring the analytics pipeline remains current and stable ([#1734](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1734), [#1739](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1739)). A minor fix was also implemented to address a duplicate issue in the CircleCI configuration ([#1736](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1736)).

### Analytics and Explorer Link Refinements
Several updates were made to improve the accuracy and presentation of analytical data. This involved updating OP Mainnet Explorer Links across various files ([#1715](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1715)) and refining the Jovian analysis notebooks to improve base fee display and drop zero values in charts ([#1735](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1735), [#1737](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1737)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#1731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1731) Record data quality errors per template
- [#1733](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1733) Exclude user ops without innerHandleOp from DQ check

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Min-Base-Fee Specification Finalized
The specification for the min-base-fee feature has been written and ratified, marking a significant step in protocol development ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/742)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Deprecating Req-Resp P2P Sync in op-node
Discussion continues on deprecating the req-resp p2p sync mechanism in `op-node` to address existing sync problems ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/14108)). The latest comment from tessr provides additional context and ideas from @emilianobonassi, who prototyped an alternative unsafe block sync mechanism. This alternative offers benefits such as being cheaper and simpler to run, faster scale-out and recovery, and addressing issues with UDP networking and static IP limitations. The proposed alternative is complementary to p2p and allows for multiple "drivers" to gossip blocks, including a centralized driver where the sequencer leader publishes the latest unsafe block via Redis.
