# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Jun 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant data pipeline enhancements, including the integration of ChainMetadataAggregator and the ability to pull system configuration data directly from on-chain contracts. A Dagster version update was also completed. Several issues related to CI flakiness and module import errors were actively discussed and one was closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Chain Metadata Aggregation
A new pipeline, `build_all_chains_metadata()`, was introduced to integrate Total Crypto metadata, providing a structured approach for future additions. This work lays the groundwork for comprehensive chain metadata management.

### On-chain System Configuration Data Integration
Leveraging previous work, the system now pulls chain system configuration data directly from on-chain contracts, storing relevant fields in GCS. This improves data accuracy and reliability for chain configurations.

### Infrastructure and Dependency Updates
The Dagster version was updated, ensuring the analytics platform runs on the latest stable release, which can bring performance improvements and new features.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Module Import Resolution
The issue concerning the missing `dist` directory in `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` versions after `10.0.238`, which caused module import errors, was closed. A merged PR is expected to resolve this.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### CI Flakiness Investigation and Improvement
Discussions continued on investigating and improving CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16271)). The latest comment from scharissis on June 24th indicates that a test flake report generator has been released and iterated upon, and test flakiness has improved. Monitoring will continue periodically. Related issues and PRs were also mentioned, including a new "Flakiness Report" that includes "Job Name" for better debugging.

### Acceptance Test Reliability
The ongoing effort to improve the reliability of acceptance tests ([#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16378)) saw further discussion. The latest comment from nonsense on July 9th indicates that the issue is being closed as tests have improved considerably, with a note to continuously monitor CI and prevent new flaky tests. Earlier discussions on June 13th highlighted that some packages, like `op-acceptance-tests/tests/interop/reorgs`, pass with `-count=5`, and a new "Flakiness Report" was shared to aid in identifying flaky tests and their associated job names. It was also noted that flakiness might be due to tests within the same package interfering with each other.
