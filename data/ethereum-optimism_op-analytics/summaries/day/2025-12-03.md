## CLOSED ISSUES

### ZK Proof Generation and Challenger Support
Several issues related to the generation of ZK proofs and the `op-challenger`'s support for ZK game types were closed. This includes the decision to use the succinct proposer for ZK proof generation ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18319)) and the implementation of support for challenging ZK game types in `op-challenger` ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18321)).

### Challenger Configuration and Robustness
Multiple issues concerning the `op-challenger`'s configuration and robustness were closed, indicating that the `op-challenger` is now capable of handling various scenarios for ZK games. These include improvements to test coverage ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18427)), reading from the DGF registry ([#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18412)), fetching challenger bonds from game arguments ([#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18413)), reloading bond values ([#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18414)), and supporting challenger address changes ([#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18415)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node` EL Sync Mode Issue
Discussion continued on an issue where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart, even when Reth has already synced data ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18468)). A new comment from `dalechyn` confirms that they are experiencing the same issue, which is blocking their Base Mainnet node.

### Acceptance Tests for New EIPs
The issue regarding writing acceptance tests for new EIPs ([#18221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18221)) received a new comment from `joshklop`. The comment suggests adding acceptance tests to ensure that features not included in `fusaka-on-l2` are properly disabled on OP chains.

### Unused OP Constants
A comment from `blockhunter270-boop` on the issue concerning unused OP constants ([#13440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/13440)) asks if the issue has been taken care of and if it can be closed.
