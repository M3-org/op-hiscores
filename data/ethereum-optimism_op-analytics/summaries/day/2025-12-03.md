# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Dec 3, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining DEX trade analytics by adding Solana data and updating filtering criteria. Several issues related to ZK proof generation and challenger support were closed, indicating progress in these areas.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Analytics Pipeline Enhancements
The DEX trades logic was updated to include Solana data in the query pipeline and refine filtering criteria for daily swaps and volume. This improves the comprehensiveness and accuracy of DEX trade analytics. ([#1770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1770))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### ZK Proof Generation and Challenger Support
Several issues related to the generation of ZK proofs and the `op-challenger`'s support for ZK game types were closed. This includes the decision to use the succinct proposer for ZK proof generation ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18319)) and the implementation of support for challenging ZK game types in `op-challenger` ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18321)).

### Challenger Configuration and Robustness
Multiple issues concerning the `op-challenger`'s configuration and robustness were closed. These include improvements to test coverage ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18427)), reading from the DGF registry ([#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18412)), fetching challenger bond from game arguments ([#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18413)), reloading bond values ([#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18414)), and supporting challenger address changes ([#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18415)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node` EL Sync Mode Issue
Issue [#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18468) discusses an `op-node` problem where it gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart, even when Reth has synced data. A user reported experiencing the same issue on Base Mainnet and suggested a temporary fix: changing the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restarting the `op-node`.

### Unused OP Constants
Issue [#13440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/13440) highlights that most OP constants are unused, with only `OP_LOAD_DOUBLE_LEFT` and `OP_LOAD_DOUBLE_RIGHT` being partially utilized. A recent comment suggests that this issue might already be resolved and asks for confirmation to close it.

### Acceptance Tests for New EIPs
Issue [#18221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18221) outlines the plan to write acceptance tests for new EIPs, specifically [7642 eth/69](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7642) and [7823 Upper-Bound MODEXP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7823). A recent comment suggests adding acceptance tests to ensure features not included in `fusaka-on-l2` are properly disabled on OP chains.
