## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Precompile Address Initialization Clarification
Discussion continued on [#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16620) regarding the initialization of addresses 0x00-0xff in the op-stack with 1 wei balance and no contract code. The latest comment from tynes clarified that these are precompile addresses, and the 1 wei balance is normal due to "obscure rules in how empty accounts work," ensuring they are not treated as empty accounts.
