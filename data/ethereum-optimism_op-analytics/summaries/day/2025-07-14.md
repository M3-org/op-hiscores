# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Jul 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on significant updates to data pipelines, particularly for platform metrics and L2Beat/Dune API integrations, alongside general maintenance and version bumps.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Data Pipeline Enhancements
Significant work was done on establishing and refining data pipelines. A new pipeline for platform metrics was introduced to integrate data from platform tooling into the BigQuery database [#1616](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1616). Adjustments were also made to handle evolutions in the L2Beat API provider field and the Dune API's date field format, ensuring continued data accuracy [#1685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1685), [#1688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1688).

### Schema and Data Formatting Updates
Changes were implemented to align data writes with current schemas, specifically by converting lists to comma-separated values for chain summaries [#1686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1686).

### Version and Deployment Updates
Multiple updates were made to bump versions and facilitate Dagster deployments [#1687](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1687), [#1689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1689), [#1690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1690).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Development Workflow Improvements
An issue related to nonce errors when approving and executing after one approval was closed, indicating a resolution to a critical development workflow hurdle [#1106](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1106).

### Test Suite Expansion
The effort to port `TestERC20Bridge` to devstack was closed, signifying progress in expanding the test suite and ensuring broader compatibility [#415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/415).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Sync Tester Development
Discussion on [#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16452) (Tracking] [Sync Tester] op-sync-tester: service for mock EL sync testing) revolved around session management for the sync tester. @protolambda suggested using HTTP middleware for pre-processing requests and attaching context, while @pcw109550 proposed a session management flow involving a `sync_init` RPC and UUID-generated session IDs for dedicated endpoints. The core idea is to avoid creating a full EL deployment for long-range sync testing.

### Interop Transaction Reinjection Testing
On [#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16656) (E2E: Invalid Interop Tx Reinjection Test), @pcw109550 outlined a testing strategy using `op-test-sequencer` to force invalid execution messages and then verify reorgs, the absence of invalid interop transactions in new L2 blocks, and their removal from the mempool. This aims to confirm that interop transactions are re-checked upon block reorgs.

### Fault Proof Consolidation Step
Issue [#15285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15285) (interop: Stress test expiry window) saw @pauldowman clarify that the "consolidation step" refers to the final stage in the fault proof program where the validity of executing messages is checked after derivation. This discussion is part of understanding the impact of the expiry window on interop message processing.

### `op-batcher` Code Duplication
Regarding [#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16677) (op-batcher: duplicate code), @geoknee acknowledged @chuwt's observation about potential duplicate `checkTxpool` calls and welcomed a PR to address it. This indicates an opportunity for code cleanup and optimization in the `op-batcher`.

### `VerifyOPCM` Script Redundancy
On [#16653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16653) (Consider making VerifyOPCM a wrapper around DeployImplementations for v2), @maurelian reported that auditors view `VerifyOPCM` as providing valuable redundancy and acting as a check against significant modifications to `DeployImplementations.s.sol`. A suggested approach is to re-run `DeployImplementations` within `VerifyOPCM` alongside its other checks.
