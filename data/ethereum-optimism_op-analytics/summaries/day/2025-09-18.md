## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node: prepare for Fusaka
Discussion on [#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17493) highlighted a concern regarding tight coupling to upstream Geth code. A comment from geoknee at 2025-09-18T14:37:04Z noted that such coupling could potentially necessitate an absolute prestate update with every upstream merge and subsequent `op-geth` or `op-node` release. This issue remains open, with its closure scheduled for October 2, 2025.
