# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a minor update to Dune pulls, alongside the closure of two significant issues related to blob priority fee tracking and a potential bug in op-node sequencer recovery mode. A new issue regarding artifact extraction was also opened.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dune Pulls Modification
A minor modification was made to the Dune pulls, affecting the `.circleci/config.yml` and `other_chains_tracking/get_qualified_txs.ipynb` files. ([#1777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1777))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
None

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking Resolution
The issue concerning blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr` has been closed. Discussions highlighted that the blob tip oracle is now deployed to production, revealing that the current `min blob cap` configuration value (4 gwei) leads to overpayment compared to the oracle's suggestion (2.51 gwei). While currently informational, the oracle's data is expected to be utilized soon. ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18102))

### Sequencer Recover Mode Bug Investigation
The potential bug in `op-node` sequencer recover mode has been closed. The investigation led to refactoring of the L1 origin code in `op-node` and a fix to prevent errors when the L1 origin is up to tip. Although the original drift issue was not reproduced, the related improvements have been implemented. ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18350))

## NEW ISSUES

### Artifact Extraction Discrepancy
A new bug has been reported where `ExtractFromFile()` in `op-deployer/pkg/deployer/artifacts/embedded.go` expects an `out/` directory within the tarball, but the `mktar` tool packages artifacts with a `forge-artifacts/` prefix. This discrepancy breaks self-hosted `.tzst` artifacts. ([#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18663))
