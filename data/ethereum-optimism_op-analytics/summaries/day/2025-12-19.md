# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a minor update to Dune pulls, alongside the closure of two significant issues related to blob priority fee tracking and a potential bug in op-node sequencer recovery mode. A new issue regarding artifact extraction was also opened.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dune Pulls Modification
A minor update was made to the Dune pulls, affecting the `.circleci/config.yml` and `other_chains_tracking/get_qualified_txs.ipynb` files. ([#1777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1777))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
None

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking Resolution
The issue concerning blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr` was closed. Discussions highlighted that the blob tip oracle is now deployed to production, and the current `min blob cap` configuration value of `4 gwei` is overpaying compared to the oracle's suggestion of `2.51 gwei`. The oracle is currently informational but is expected to be utilized soon. ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18102))

### Op-Node Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug Investigation
A potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer recovery mode was investigated and subsequently closed. While the specific drift issue could not be reproduced, related refactoring of the L1 origin code in `op-node` and a fix for not erroring when the L1 origin is up to tip were implemented. The issue may be reopened if the drift reoccurs. ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18350))

## NEW ISSUES

### Artifact Extraction Bug
A new bug was reported in `op-deployer/pkg/deployer/artifacts/embedded.go` where `ExtractFromFile()` expects an `out/` directory within the tarball, but `mktar` packages artifacts with a `forge-artifacts/` prefix. This discrepancy breaks self-hosted `.tzst` artifacts. ([#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18663))
