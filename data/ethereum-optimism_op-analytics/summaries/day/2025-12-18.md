# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on maintenance, with a bug fix addressing failing jobs and an update to the Dagster deployment configuration. Discussions continued on interop transaction evaluation and a potential issue with super root trace output.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dagster Maintenance and Bug Fixes
*   A bug causing some jobs to fail was addressed, improving the reliability of data processing workflows ([#1775](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1775)).
*   The Dagster deployment configuration was updated, indicating ongoing infrastructure maintenance and improvements ([#1776](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1776)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Kona Interop Action Tests Re-enabled
*   The Kona interop action tests have been re-enabled, ensuring their functionality. However, these tests are not yet blocking for CI, a change planned for when Kona migrates to the Optimism monorepo ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18613)).

## NEW ISSUES
### Super Root Trace Output Review
*   A new issue was opened to review the correct trace output when the next super root is not found, specifically concerning the `InvalidTransitionHash` assertion in tests ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18643)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18574))
Discussions continued regarding the necessity of the additional transaction for replacement blocks. The latest comments indicate a consensus to simplify the protocol by removing the extra deposit transaction for proofs, as it's deemed unnecessary in a ZK dispute system. It was noted that the Supernode should be able to generate the required data for proofs without this additional transaction. Concerns about the accuracy and availability of data if not part of consensus were raised, but it's believed these become less of a concern with ZK proofs, as generating a ZK proof would always re-run the derivation process. The next steps involve assigning someone for architectural refactoring and updating the Interop specification.

### op-challenger: Review correct trace output when next super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18643))
The discussion confirmed that the identified issue regarding the `InvalidTransitionHash` in the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test appears to be a real problem. It was noted that the `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash on the first chain with insufficient data. There's also a question about the correctness of the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test itself and the behavior of the `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC, which returns a "not found" error if any chain isn't supported by L1, even if the supervisor's superroot RPC can return super roots for blocks that aren't cross-safe.
