# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on maintenance, with a bug fix for failing jobs and an update to Dagster, alongside ongoing discussions on interop transaction evaluation and super root trace output.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Analytics Job Stability
*   A bug causing some analytics jobs to fail was addressed and fixed, improving the reliability of data processing. ([#1775](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1775))

### Infrastructure Updates
*   The Dagster deployment was updated, affecting configuration files within the `helm/dagster` directory and the `Makefile`. ([#1776](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1776))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Kona Interop Test Re-enablement
*   The issue concerning disabled Kona interop action tests was resolved, with the tests now re-enabled. While currently not a blocking factor for CI, plans are in place to make them so once Kona is integrated into the Optimism monorepo. ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18613))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx
Discussions continue regarding the necessity and design of injected replacement transactions for interop. The latest comments indicate a consensus towards simplifying the protocol by removing the additional deposit transaction for proofs, as it's deemed unnecessary for ZK proof generation. The supernode's ability to generate necessary data for proofs is highlighted, suggesting that the replacement transaction provides no value in a ZK dispute system. Concerns about the accuracy and availability of data if not part of consensus were raised, but it's believed these become less of a concern with ZK proofs. The next steps involve assigning someone for architectural refactoring and updating the Interop specification. ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18574))

### op-challenger: Review correct trace output when next super root is not found
The discussion centers on a potential problem with the `op-challenger`'s trace output when the next super root is not found. It was noted that the `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash on the first chain with insufficient data, suggesting that the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test might be incorrect. There's also a debate on whether the supervisor can return a super root for unsafe blocks and if the `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC returns a "not found" error if any chain isn't supported by L1.
