## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Superchain-Ops Tooling Enhancements**: Several issues related to the Superchain-Ops tooling were closed, indicating significant progress in improving the developer experience and functionality. This includes addressing the need for "stacked" proposals with incrementing nonces ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/342)), refining the `SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER` functionality ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/448)), updating task paths for mainnet operations ([#600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/600), [#547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/547)), and improving the `MultisigTask` architecture ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/636)). Additionally, issues concerning the `StateOverrideManager` ([#814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/814)), `StandardValidator` checks in templates ([#838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/838)), and reading addresses for chains not in the Superchain Registry ([#923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/923)) were resolved.
*   **CI/CD and Testing Improvements**: Progress was made on continuous integration and testing. This includes the closure of an issue to automatically run tasks in CI if they are in a non-terminal state ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/337)), and an issue to speed up the `template_regression_tests` CI job ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/648)).
*   **Documentation and User Experience**: Issues related to documentation and user experience were addressed, such as updating paths in improvement docs ([#548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/548)), providing simple UX for nonce overrides ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/770)), and printing state diffs in markdown format ([#777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/777)).
*   **Task and Registry Management**: Several issues related to task and registry management were closed, including improvements to the OPCM Migrate Script ([#16326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16326)), the creation of a mainnet example for the OPCM template ([#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/651)), and more granular checking of `addresses.json` to reduce submodule updates ([#753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/753)).
*   **Training and Onboarding**: The issue concerning setting up a training call for the new Superchain-Ops tooling was closed, indicating that loom videos and training calls have been completed ([#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/514)).
*   **Testing and Validation**: Issues related to testing and validation were closed, including a test for Sepolia task to transfer owner of ProtocolVersions ([#554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/554)), updating tests to use `contracts-bedrock` safe-tools and `stdStorage` library ([#605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/605)), and checking domain hash from simulation matches `VALIDATIONS.md` hash entry ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/679)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Abnormal CPU usage with latest op-geth ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/613))**: Discussion continues regarding high CPU usage with `op-geth v1.101511.0`. The latest comments suggest that the high CPU usage might be temporary, related to log indexing rebuilds after backporting `go-ethereum v1.15.11`. Users are sharing command-line arguments for `pprof` to help diagnose the issue, and one user reported that the CPU usage returned to normal after the index upgrade completed.
*   **Refactor signFromChildMultisig to reduce noisy terminal output ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/781))**: Community members are actively engaging with this issue, with multiple individuals expressing interest in contributing to the refactor. The core problem identified is the excessive logging from the `print` function within `simulateRun`, making it difficult to focus on critical signing information. Proposed solutions involve removing or selectively reducing this output.
*   **Use GoReleaser for op-node/batcher/proposer/challenger release pipeline ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16097))**: The discussion revolves around automating the release pipeline and generating release notes for core OP Stack components. A recent comment suggests wiring up `op-workbench` to automatically execute `git cliff` commands for changelog generation and pushing them via the GitHub API, aiming for a "one-click solution" for high-quality changelogs.
*   **[op-acceptance-tests] Move all AT's into the one workflow ([#16272](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16272))**: A recent comment provides links to related pull requests in `infra` and `optimism` repositories, indicating ongoing work to consolidate acceptance tests into a single workflow.
*   **what's the difference between supersim and interop kurtosis devnet? ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/399))**: The discussion clarifies that `supersim` is a lighter-weight local development tool built around Anvil for testing multichain/interop applications, while Kurtosis is used by the OP Stack for chain-level testing. The latest comment confirms that `supersim` is primarily for testing dapps, whereas Kurtosis is used for the chains themselves.
