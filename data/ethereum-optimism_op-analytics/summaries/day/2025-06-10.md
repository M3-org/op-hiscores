# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Jun 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing data ingestion capabilities by integrating Superchain Registry data for addresses and chain lists, alongside an important Dagster version update.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Registry Data Integration
Efforts were made to pull essential data from the Superchain Registry. This includes pulling the chain address list, which will be used to combine with system config data from RPC calls for a consolidated tab ([#1641](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1641)). Additionally, the full chain list was pulled to enhance data accessibility and accuracy ([#1642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1642)).

### Infrastructure Updates
The Dagster version was updated ([#1644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1644)), ensuring the analytics pipeline leverages the latest features and improvements for data orchestration.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes
Discussion on [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15789) revolves around understanding and supporting OPCM changes for the Fault Proof creator contract. The latest comment from stevennevins on July 9, 2025, outlines a detailed checklist of tasks, including moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, removing `anchorStateRegistry` from `StandardValidatorOverrides`, unskipping and updating tests, reviewing comments, addressing TODOs, rebasing updates from EVM safety, and fixing Go updates.

### op-supervisor: Event Overflow on Large Unsafe Head Gap
Issue [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16335) addresses a critical problem where the supervisor can crash-loop due to an event overflow when the unsafe head gap grows too large. The discussion highlights potential culprits and solutions. On June 19, 2025, nonsense added a PR to include a gauge for in-flight events to identify the problematic event type and suggested setting up an alert for total in-flight events. Earlier, on June 17, 2025, sebastianst suggested that `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` might be the culprit, while nonsense and axelKingsley debated this, with axelKingsley explaining that `ChainIndexingContinueEvent`s are a response to `ChainProcess` events and should not stack up. Nonsense is working on adding a counter per event type to gather more data if the issue reoccurs.
