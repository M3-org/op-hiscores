# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Jul 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining data ingestion processes, particularly for Ethereum and Celo, within the Superchain analytics. Efforts included adding Ethereum to Goldsky data ingestion and temporarily disabling block batch processing for both Ethereum and Celo to address processing issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Data Ingestion Refinements
Improvements were made to the data ingestion pipeline, specifically by adding Ethereum to the Goldsky data ingestion process to expand the scope of Superchain analytics. ([#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1696))

### Block Batch Processing Adjustments
Temporary measures were implemented to manage non-standard chain processing. This included ignoring Celo in block batch processing due to non-standard chain behavior and turning off block batch models for Ethereum pending further investigation into ingestion processes. ([#1698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1698), [#1699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1699))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interoperability Test Resolution
An issue related to interop acceptance tests failing due to an op-geth version bump was closed, with a linked pull request expected to provide a solution. ([#16731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16731))

### Acceptance Test Handover
The general interop acceptance test issue was closed, indicating that its handling will be transferred to the Protocol team. ([#298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/298))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Topology Alignment
Discussion continues on aligning the acceptance test topology with the real-world production environment. The issue [#16746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16746) highlights that the current local Kurtosis interop devnet exposes the sequencer publicly, which deviates from production. The latest comment from pcw109550 at 2025-07-18T11:40:27Z clarifies that this issue stems from a missing flag in the op-geth sequencer used by acceptance tests, causing test failures. The focus is now on making the Kurtosisnet YAML description match production, including adding components like proxyd and verifier nodes.
