## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona Performance and Interoperability
Discussions on [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18533) highlighted the critical need to offload expensive operations like keccak and sha2 to the host for Kona-SP1 to ensure performance and correctness in ZK Proofs. A user inquired about the progress in identifying all such operations and if other cryptographic operations might require similar offloading. Additionally, [#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18613) was identified as a duplicate of an existing issue in `op-rs/kona`, emphasizing the need to enable and fix disabled Kona interop action tests.

### U18 Release Finalization
On [#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18548), a user requested an update on the finalization of Upgrade 18 (U18) releases. Key questions included whether governance approval for `op-program` has been received and if any critical issues on the testnet are blocking the U18 finalization.

### Critical Bug in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction`
Issue [#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18554) detailed a critical fuzzer test failure when `_7702Target = address(0)` in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction`. This bug indicates potential incorrect behavior when handling deposits with a null address and its impact on aliasing. Immediate prioritization and assignment to a contract developer were suggested to fix the logical error.

### P2P Connection Instability
Discussion on [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18570) focused on the flakiness of `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` P2P connections in system tests. This issue is considered a major bug affecting test environment stability and potential production compatibility, requiring a deep dive into the P2P implementations of both clients.

### Node Synchronization Issues
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581) reported nodes failing to synchronize, with errors like "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload." These errors suggest the L1 Execution Client cannot provide necessary state data to the Op-Node for L2 block creation. Additional information was requested regarding client configurations, full logs, and startup flags to diagnose the problem.

### `op-challenger` Panic on BlobBaseFee
On [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18608), a `nil pointer dereference` panic in `op-challenger`'s `RecordBlobBaseFee` function was reported. This likely occurs when the L1 does not support `blobBaseFee`, causing the field to be uninitialized. The user provided their `op-challenger` and `geth` versions, confirming the L1 is a local private chain not upgraded to Dencun and thus lacking Blob transaction support.
