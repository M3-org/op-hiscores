# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Dec 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the opening of a new pull request to add CSV dumps for RetroPGF Seasons 7-8. Several critical issues were actively discussed, including a nil pointer dereference in `op-challenger` related to blob base fees, P2P connection flakiness, and a fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction`.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Critical `op-challenger` Panic and L1 Synchronization Issues
Discussions continued on the `op-challenger` panic due to an invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18608)). The issue is suspected to be related to an L1 not supporting `blobBaseFee`, causing `op-challenger` to attempt to access an uninitialized field. Users provided details on their `op-challenger` and Geth versions, confirming the use of an older Geth client that does not support Dencun or Blob transactions. The team is investigating the `txmgr` metrics initialization.

Another critical issue, [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581), concerns nodes failing to synchronize, with errors like "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload." This indicates the L1 Execution Client is not providing necessary state data to the Op-Node. The team requested detailed information on client configurations, full logs, and startup flags to diagnose the problem.

### Interoperability and Protocol Simplification
The issue of evaluating and reworking injected replacement transactions for interop ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18574)) saw active discussion. There's a consensus that simplifying the protocol by eliminating the additional deposit transaction for proofs is the best architectural solution. The team plans to assign someone for architectural refactoring and update the Interop specification to reflect how the Superlayer will generate necessary data without the extra deposit.

### Kona SP1 Optimization and Test Flakiness
Discussions on optimizing Kona SP1 by offloading expensive operations to the host ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18533)) continued, with questions raised about identifying all areas requiring offloading and other potentially expensive cryptographic operations.

The issue of `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` connection flakiness in system tests ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18570)) was highlighted as a major bug affecting test environment stability and potential production compatibility. The team is prioritizing this and seeking a developer to investigate P2P implementation differences.

### Other Active Issues
*   **Finalizing U18 Releases** ([#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18548)): A request was made for a status update on governance approval for `op-program` and any critical issues found on the testnet that could block or delay the U18 releases.
*   **`OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` Fuzzing Test Failure** ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18554)): A critical bug report regarding a fuzzing test failure when `_7702Target = address(0)` was discussed. This indicates a potential logical error in handling deposits with a null address and its impact on aliasing. Immediate prioritization and assignment to a contracts developer were suggested.
*   **Kona Interop Action Tests** ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18613)): This issue, ensuring Kona interop action tests are not disabled, was identified as a duplicate of an existing issue in the `op-rs/kona` repository, and work is underway to get these tests functioning.
