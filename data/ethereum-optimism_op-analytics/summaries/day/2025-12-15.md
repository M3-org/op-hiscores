# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Dec 15, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the opening of a new pull request to add CSV dumps for RetroPGF Seasons 7-8. Discussions continued on several active issues, focusing on optimizing ZK Proofs, finalizing U18 releases, addressing a critical fuzzing test failure, fixing P2P connection flakiness, evaluating interop transaction rework, and debugging node synchronization problems. A new critical issue regarding `op-challenger` panic due to unsupported blobBaseFee was also actively discussed.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Optimizing ZK Proofs for Kona-SP1**: Discussion on [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18533) centered on offloading expensive operations like keccak and sha2 to the host for performance in the kona-sp1 program. A comment from rdin777 inquired about the progress in identifying all areas requiring syscall offloading and if other computationally intensive operations might need similar treatment.

- **Finalizing U18 Releases**: On [#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18548), rdin777 requested an update from the assignee, @pauldownman, regarding the governance approval for `op-program` and any critical issues found on the testnet that could block or delay the U18 release finalization.

- **Addressing `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` Fuzzing Failure**: Issue [#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18554) highlighted a critical fuzzing test failure when `_7702Target = address(0)`. rdin777 emphasized the severity of this bug, suggesting immediate prioritization, labeling it as critical/security, and assigning a contract developer to fix the logical error related to etching empty bytes at line 2688 to ensure correct L1/L2 bridge operation.

- **Fixing `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` P2P Connection Flakiness**: In [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18570), rdin777 acknowledged the critical nature of P2P connection instability in system tests, especially for mixed `op-geth/op-reth` nodes. They recommended classifying it as a major bug or high-priority chore and assigning a developer to investigate P2P implementation differences and `admin_peers` encoding.

- **Evaluating and Reworking Injected Replacement Transactions**: Discussion on [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18574) revolved around the necessity and implementation of injected replacement transactions for invalid interop transactions. Inphi suggested simplifying the protocol by not adding the extra deposit transaction if the Supernode can generate the necessary data for proofs. axelKingsley questioned the need for re-running derivation to identify the original block hash if the Supernode can supply this data. ajsutton countered that the additional transaction is critical for the proofs system to prevent overwhelming honest challengers and that gas limits are unlikely to be exceeded due to reserved gas for system transactions.

- **Debugging Node Synchronization Issues**: Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581) reported nodes not synchronizing, with errors like "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload." rdin777 requested detailed information about the L1 Execution and Consensus clients, full logs, and client configurations (startup flags) to diagnose the problem, which typically indicates the L1 Execution Client cannot provide necessary state data for L2 block creation.

- **`op-challenger` Panic due to BlobBaseFee**: Issue [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18608) reported a critical `nil pointer dereference` in `op-challenger` related to `RecordBlobBaseFee`. lyh169 confirmed the issue occurs when the L1 chain does not support blob transactions (e.g., an old Geth version not upgraded to Dencun). rdin777 acknowledged the severity and requested the `op-challenger` version, L1 client details, and L1 configuration to expedite a patch, suspecting an uninitialized field related to BlobBaseFee metrics.
