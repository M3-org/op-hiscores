## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interoperability and Transaction Replacement Evaluation
Discussions on [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18574) centered on the necessity of injected replacement transactions for the fault proof system. @ajsutton emphasized that the additional transaction, which records the replaced block hash, is crucial for the proof system to prevent overwhelming honest challengers. They also noted that the fixed gas cost of the inserted transaction and reserved gas in the SystemConfig contract mitigate the risk of exceeding block gas limits. @axelKingsley questioned if the Supernode could provide the necessary data, potentially simplifying the protocol by avoiding the extra deposit transaction. @Inphi agreed that while the additional transaction is needed for proofs, simplifying the protocol by not adding the extra deposit transaction would be worthwhile if the Supernode can generate the required proof data.

### Node Synchronization and Data Availability Issues
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581) highlights problems with node synchronization, specifically "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. @rdin777 requested more information on client configurations (L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client), full logs, and startup flags to diagnose the issue, which typically points to the L1 Execution Client failing to provide necessary state data to the Op-Node. @tsulhc noted similar issues with Publicnode snapshots but found success with snapsync using `--syncmode=execution-layer` for a new Unichain node.

### op-challenger BlobBaseFee Panic
The discussion on [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18608) addresses a `nil pointer dereference` panic in `op-challenger` related to `RecordBlobBaseFee`. @rdin777 identified this as a serious issue, likely caused by `op-challenger` attempting to access an uninitialized `BlobBaseFee` field, possibly because the L1 does not support blob transactions. @rdin777 requested the `op-challenger` version, L1 Execution Client details, and L1 configuration to expedite a fix. @lyh169 confirmed the issue occurs with an older Geth version that does not support Dencun and blob transactions, suggesting a flag similar to `--data-availability-type=calldata` for `op-batch` might prevent the panic.

### Kona-SP1 Performance Optimization
Issue [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18533) focuses on offloading expensive operations in kona-sp1 to the host for performance. @rdin777 emphasized the criticality of offloading operations like keccak and sha2. They inquired about the progress in identifying all code areas requiring syscall offloading and whether other computationally expensive operations might need a similar approach.

### Finalizing U18 Releases
The finalization of Upgrade 18 releases is being tracked in [#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18548). @rdin777 requested an update on two key blocking factors: governance approval for `op-program` and the status of testnet runs, specifically if any critical issues have been found that could delay the finalization.

### P2P Connection Instability
Issue [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18570) addresses flakiness in `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` P2P connections within system tests. @rdin777 classified this as a major bug or high-priority chore due to its impact on test stability and potential production compatibility. They recommended assigning a developer to investigate the P2P implementation differences and verify the correctness of `admin_peers` encoding.

### `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` Fuzzing Test Failure
A critical bug in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when `_7702Target = address(0)` is discussed in [#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18554). @rdin777 highlighted the severity of this issue, indicating potential incorrect behavior with zero-address deposits and aliasing. They recommended immediate prioritization with `bug` and `critical` labels and assigning a contract developer to fix the logical error in line 2688 related to etching empty bytes.
