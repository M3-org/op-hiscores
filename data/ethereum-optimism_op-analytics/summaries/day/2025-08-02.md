# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Aug 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on refining data processing by adding Celo and Ethereum to an exclusion list for model publishing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
### Data Pipeline Refinements
An exclusion list was implemented to prevent Celo and Ethereum data from being published by certain models, as they are not yet ready for this process ([#1716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1716)).
