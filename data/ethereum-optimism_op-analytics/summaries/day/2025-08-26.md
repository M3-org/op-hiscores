# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Aug 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on optimizing data processing for Dune Analytics, specifically reducing the run time for "All Transactions" data. Discussions on active issues covered troubleshooting `op-proposer` configurations, refining sync testing strategies, and enhancing flashblocks-related alerts.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Data Optimization
A pull request was opened to reduce the run time for the "All Transactions" data on Dune Analytics, specifically targeting the `other_chains_tracking/get_all_txs.ipynb` file. This aims to improve efficiency in data processing. ([#1729](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1729))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Challenger Support in op-up
The issue regarding `op-up` support for the challenger was closed, with the conclusion that distributing the challenger within `op-up` for `sysgo` is likely not worth the effort, and focusing on other backends like Docker is preferred. ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17005))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-proposer Failed to Create Transaction
Discussion continued on troubleshooting `op-proposer` failures. The latest comment confirmed that setting `--game-type=1` resolved the issue for one user, indicating a misconfiguration of the game type as a common cause. Previous comments highlighted the `NoImplementation` error and suggested checking contract configuration or `op-proposer`'s game-type setting. ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/13502))

### Sync Test Using Sync-Tester
Ideas for sync test cases were discussed. The latest comment outlined priorities: checking all OP Stack Hard Fork transitions (not just Isthmus), testing multiple CLs with a single Sync Tester, and incorporating user transactions into L2 blocks for sync validation. Items 2 and 3 were noted as being captured in a separate issue. ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16703))

### Load Testing Flashblocks on Devnets
A comment indicated that a report summarizing the load test scenarios, networks, and results is currently being worked on. ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16756))

### Alert for Non-Flashblocks-Enabled Sequencer or Flashblocks Off
A pull request for `rollup-boost` was linked, with the intention to create the alert once that PR lands. This alert aims to detect when a backup sequencer without flashblocks components becomes active, indicating a potential issue with flashblocks. ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16867))

### Alert on Low Peer Count Health of Flashblocks-Enabled Sequencer
It was noted that peer count alerting for `op-node` sequencer peering already exists for counts less than 2. The plan is to add `reth`/`op-rbuilder` peer count monitoring for this specific alert, which targets critical low peer counts (e.g., below 3 or 4) for flashblocks-enabled sequencers. ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16868))
