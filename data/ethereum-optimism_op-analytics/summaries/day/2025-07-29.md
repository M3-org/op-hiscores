### Congestion-based Builder Transaction Reordering
Discussion continued on the design for congestion-based builder transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/306)). The latest comment from `moonfury-ops` at 2025-07-29T20:33:56Z expressed interest in collaborating on this issue. The issue's description outlines the need for a design document to explore tracking DA usage excess over time with an exponential cost/score penalty, noting that this concept could be implemented outside the protocol to test ideas for an L1 congestion cost component.
