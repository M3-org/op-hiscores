### Node Synchronization Challenges
A critical issue, [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581), reports that nodes are not synchronizing, with users experiencing "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. This problem appears to affect multiple chains including Optimism, Base, and Unichain. Initial discussions suggest that the L1 Execution Client (e.g., Geth or Erigon) might not be providing the necessary state data to the Op-Node for L2 block creation. One user noted that using Publicnode snapshots led to this issue, while `snapsync` with `--syncmode=execution-layer` worked for a new Unichain node. The maintainer has requested detailed information including client configurations, full logs for Op-Node and L1 Execution Client, and command-line flags for all three clients to diagnose the problem further.
