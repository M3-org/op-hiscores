# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Dec 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a critical bug fix for circulating supply calculations and the emergence of a significant issue regarding node synchronization across multiple Optimism-based chains.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Circulating Supply Calculation Fix
*   A bug affecting the circulating supply calculation was resolved, ensuring accuracy in API data retrieval and error handling for `op_governance_data/op_circulating_supply.ipynb` ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1773)).

### Node Synchronization Challenges
*   An active issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581) reports that nodes are not synchronizing, with users experiencing "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors.
*   This problem appears to affect multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Unichain, particularly when using `op-geth` and syncing with snapshots from publicnode.com.
*   The issue is observed with `op-node v1.16.3` and `op-geth v1.101603.5 jovian`.
*   One user noted that `snapsync` with `--syncmode=execution-layer` worked for syncing a new Unichain node, suggesting a potential workaround or a specific issue with snapshot-based syncing.
*   The community is seeking more information on client configurations (L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client), full logs for `Op-Node` and L1 Execution Client, and complete flag lists for all three clients to diagnose the problem further.
