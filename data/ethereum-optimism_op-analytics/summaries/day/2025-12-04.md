## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node EL Sync Mode Stuck
Discussions continued on an issue where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart when reth already has synced data. Users are experiencing an initialization loop with `el_syncing=true`. A temporary workaround suggested is to change the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restart the `op-node`. This issue is impacting Base Mainnet nodes configured for execution layer syncing.
- Users are experiencing `op-node` getting stuck in an initialization loop when configured with `--syncmode=execution-layer` after a restart, continuously reporting `el_syncing=true` ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18468)).
- A temporary fix suggested is to change the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restart the `op-node`.
- This issue is blocking Base Mainnet nodes configured for execution layer syncing.
