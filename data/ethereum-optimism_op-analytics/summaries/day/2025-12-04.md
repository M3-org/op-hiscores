## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node EL Sync Mode Stuck
Discussions continued on issue [#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18468), where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart when reth already has synced data. The latest comment from louisliu2048 suggests a temporary workaround: changing the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restarting the `op-node`. This issue is blocking Base Mainnet nodes configured for execution layer syncing.
