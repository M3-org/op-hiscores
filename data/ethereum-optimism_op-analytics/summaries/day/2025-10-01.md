A new feature was added to pull Superchain configuration data, specifically for `eip1559_elasticity` and `eip1559_denominator`, from the `superchain-registry`. This involved modifications across multiple files including `Makefile`, `Pipfile`, `helm/dagster/values.yaml`, and various Python source and test files.
