# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Sep 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on the successful deployment and stabilization of flashblocks on Optimism's mainnet sequencers, alongside the resolution of several critical alerts and the closure of outdated proof-related smoke tests.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Stability
Flashblocks have been successfully enabled on mainnet sequencers, with stability confirmed. This involved deploying flashblocks on a single sequencer for initial evaluation, followed by deployment on the remaining sequencers. Associated PRs were merged to support these deployments. Alerts for low peer count health on flashblocks-enabled sequencers were also addressed and resolved. ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16759), [#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16760), [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17317), [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16868))

### Sequencer Health and Alerting Improvements
Improvements were made to sequencer health monitoring, including the resolution of an issue regarding alerts for unhealthy non-flashblocks enabled sequencers. Additionally, `op-conductor` was released and deployed with EL p2p healthchecks, ensuring robust monitoring of sequencer health. ([#17143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17143), [#17153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17153))

### Proofs Smoke Test Deprecation
Several smoke tests related to `op-challenger`, `op-dispute-mon`, and `op-proposer` were closed as they are no longer required. ([#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/141), [#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/140), [#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/142), [#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/143))

### Documentation and Infrastructure Updates
A documentation issue suggesting an example for custom chains in the bridging tutorial was updated and closed. An issue concerning the upgrade of `rbuilder` and `node-reth` for a Reth chain stall fix was closed as it was determined to be a non-blocker for L2. The issue regarding Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy was also closed as it will not be implemented. ([#1473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1473), [#17328](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17328), [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17194))

## NEW ISSUES

### Contract Upgrade Testing
A new issue was opened to add soneium to the contract upgrade tests in CI, requiring configuration. ([#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17332))

### OP-Program Enhancements
An issue was created to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program` specs, providing key information for block hash lookups by number. ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17416))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-program: Add hint for fast block header oracle lookup ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17416))
The discussion revolves around adding a hint to `op-program` specs for faster block header oracle lookups. A draft PR has been created to implement this, and validation is needed to ensure it contains the correct information.

### Add soneium to contract upgrade tests ([#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17332))
A PR has been opened to address this issue, which aims to include soneium in the contract upgrade tests within the CI pipeline.
