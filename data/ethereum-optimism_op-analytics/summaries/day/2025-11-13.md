# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Nov 13, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on updating analytical notebooks for Orderly and Lyra, including new data for random and top percentile sampling over the last 120 days. This involved rerunning analyses to ensure output accuracy and addressing issues related to `op-sync-tester` and `kona` support.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Analytical Notebook Updates
*   Updated `jovian_analysis.ipynb` to include new Orderly and Lyra results for both top percentile and random sampling over the last 120 days ([#1763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1763)).
*   Reran Orderly analysis due to outdated output, ensuring the latest data is reflected in the notebooks and associated image files ([#1764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1764)).

### `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` Support for `sysext`
Discussion on [#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16704) regarding `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` supporting `sysext` indicates that Kurtosis, the deployment tool, is being deprecated, suggesting a shift in strategy for this feature.

### Embedded Custom Prestes in Kona
Issue [#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18271) tracks the addition of support for embedded custom prestates to Kona. A fix is currently under review, as noted in a comment referencing a pull request in the `op-rs/kona` repository.

### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for `print_staging_report`
The discussion on [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1148) centers on updating the `print_staging_report` script for Dispute Game v2 compatibility. Key points include adapting the script to read game arguments from the DGF's `gameArgs` storage, rather than the game implementation contract. There's also a concern about the script's current assumption of only Permissioned and Permissionless games, as the new system will have two permissionless games, which might impact the JSON output format.
