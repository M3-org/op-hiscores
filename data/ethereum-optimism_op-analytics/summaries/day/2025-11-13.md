# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Nov 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating and rerunning Jovian analysis notebooks, specifically for Orderly and Lyra results, incorporating both top percentile and random sampling data for the last 120 days.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Jovian Analysis Updates
*   The `jovian_analysis.ipynb` notebook was updated to include new Orderly and Lyra results. These updates cover both top percentile and random sampling data for the past 120 days, generating new HTML outputs and various PNG visualizations for DA usage, compression, and utilization analysis ([#1763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1763)).
*   An Orderly analysis run was re-executed due to an output not being updated, resulting in refreshed scalar comparison and comprehensive summary images ([#1764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1764)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona Prestate Support
*   Discussion on [#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18271) indicates that a fix for adding support for embedded custom prestates to Kona is currently under review, with a pull request linked for reference.

### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Reports
*   Issue [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1148) discusses updating the `print_staging_report` script for Dispute Game v2 compatibility. The latest comments highlight that the script currently reads game arguments from the game implementation contract and needs adaptation to read from `gameArgs` storage in the DGF if available. There's also a concern about the script assuming only Permissioned and Permissionless games, while the new system might have two permissionless games, potentially impacting the JSON output format.
