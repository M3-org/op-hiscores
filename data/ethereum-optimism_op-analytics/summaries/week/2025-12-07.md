# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity was centered on maintaining data integrity while responding to a critical, emerging infrastructure challenge. A key bug affecting circulating supply calculations was resolved, enhancing the accuracy of on-chain analytics. However, a significant portion of attention shifted to a newly surfaced node synchronization issue that is impacting multiple chains across the Superchain ecosystem, including Optimism and Base. This has become a top priority, with active investigation underway to diagnose the root cause.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
### Data Integrity and Bug Fixes
- A bug in the circulating supply calculation was addressed, ensuring more accurate data retrieval and improved error handling for API-sourced data ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1773)). This fix is crucial for maintaining the reliability of the project's core analytics.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
### New & Active Issues
The primary focus this week has been on a high-priority active issue, [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581), which represents a potential blocker for users across the Superchain.
- **Node Synchronization Failures:** Users reported that nodes are failing to synchronize on multiple chains (Optimism, Base, Unichain), encountering "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors.
- **Investigation:** The current hypothesis is that L1 Execution Clients (like Geth or Erigon) may not be correctly providing state data to the Op-Node, preventing L2 block creation. Maintainers are actively gathering detailed logs and client configurations from affected users to diagnose the problem.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was exemplified by the response to the node synchronization issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581)). The discussion highlights active engagement between users and maintainers, with community members providing detailed error reports and one user suggesting a potential workaround involving `snapsync`. This collaborative diagnostic process is critical for resolving this complex, multi-chain problem.
