# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity was characterized by a critical data integrity fix and the emergence of a significant network health challenge. A key bug affecting the circulating supply calculation was resolved, enhancing the accuracy of governance data. However, a major issue surfaced concerning node synchronization failures across multiple Superchain networks, including Base and Optimism. This problem ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581)), which appears related to `op-geth` and snapshot syncing, has become a primary focus for community-driven diagnostics.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving the reliability of core governance metrics.

### Governance Data Integrity
*   A bug in the circulating supply calculation was fixed, ensuring that API data retrieval and error handling within the `op_circulating_supply.ipynb` notebook are now accurate. This is a crucial improvement for downstream tools and analyses that rely on this data ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1773)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The issue tracker saw the emergence of a high-priority problem affecting node operators across the Superchain ecosystem.

*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed during this period.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   A critical issue, [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581), was reported concerning widespread node synchronization failures. Operators are encountering "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors when syncing nodes for chains like Base, Optimism, and Unichain.
    *   The problem seems to be linked to using `op-node v1.16.3` and `op-geth v1.101603.5 jovian` with snapshots from publicnode.com.
    *   Investigation is active, with the community gathering logs and client configurations to diagnose the root cause. A potential workaround involving `snapsync` with `--syncmode=execution-layer` has been suggested by a user.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community collaboration was most visible in the response to the node synchronization issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581)). Users and maintainers are actively working together to gather diagnostic data, including client configurations and logs, to troubleshoot the complex, multi-chain problem. The sharing of a potential workaround highlights the community's collaborative approach to resolving critical infrastructure challenges.
