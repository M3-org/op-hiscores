# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on data refinement and strategic housekeeping. Key progress was made in enhancing chain tracking capabilities for the Superchain ecosystem by updating metadata inputs. The team also addressed a number of long-standing issues, officially deprecating older tooling like Kurtosis and a Discord-based faucet, and streamlining the chain validation process to be report-based. A critical bug affecting the gas scalar in the first block after genesis was identified, with a fix already in progress.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving the accuracy and scope of the project's data analytics and resolving specific bugs.

- **Superchain & Collective Economics Data Refinements:**
  - To improve chain tracking, the `chain_metadata_raw.csv` file was updated to include a new "EC Ecosystem" column, providing better insight into ecosystem participation ([#1757](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1757), [#1756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1756)).
  - A bug fix was implemented in the `get_op_collective_net_revenue_balances.ipynb` notebook to correctly handle calculations when there is zero inflight ETH, ensuring more robust economic data analysis ([#1758](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1758)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The week saw a significant effort in backlog grooming, resulting in the closure of numerous issues and clarification on active development priorities.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Tooling Deprecation:** Several issues related to Kurtosis ([#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/12952)) and a Discord-based Sepolia ETH faucet ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16975)) were closed, marking a strategic shift away from these tools.
  - **Process Streamlining:** The validation process for new chains was updated. Issues concerning blocking validation on PRs ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/689)) and genesis validation checks ([#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/696)) were closed as the team moves to a non-blocking, report-based approach.
  - **Jovian Upgrade Finalization:** Work related to the Jovian upgrade was concluded with the closure of issues concerning transaction bytecode and `daFootprintGasScalar` defaults ([#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/772), [#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/773)).
  - **Configuration & Contracts:** An issue for rewiring interopgen config was closed as "won't fix" due to shifting priorities ([#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17614)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **DA Footprint Limit Bug:** A key discussion on issue [#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17946) confirmed a bug where the first block after genesis incorrectly received a 0 gas scalar. The cause was traced to the genesis SystemConfig, and a fix has been implemented in PR #17947.
  - **Reopened Dispute Game Issue:** Issue [#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17267), related to updating `OPCMStandardValidator` for new dispute game contracts, was reopened. This indicates that tests are still being skipped when V2 is enabled, and further work is required.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The activity this week points to a strong internal focus on refining processes and clearing the technical backlog. The large number of closed issues reflects a coordinated effort to align the project's active work with its current strategic priorities. The rapid identification and resolution cycle for the DA footprint limit bug ([#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17946)) demonstrates an efficient collaboration loop between identifying, diagnosing, and fixing protocol-level issues.
