# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on expanding the project's analytical capabilities and engaging in deep technical discussions on core infrastructure. New chain analysis output was added for five chains, providing updated gas limit data and new analytical plots. Meanwhile, significant planning and problem-solving took place in active issues, with a focus on the upcoming Kona/Cannon integration, improving CI/CD for a better developer experience, and addressing a critical P2P gossip configuration bug.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary completed work this week involved enhancing the project's data analysis tooling.

- **Expanded Chain Analysis Data:** New analysis output was generated for Ink, Mode, Soneium, Unichain, and Worldchain. This update included refreshed gas limit data, new analytical plots, and an updated README for the `jovian_analysis` notebook, providing more comprehensive insights into these chains ([#1740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1740)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed this week. Discussions were concentrated on several key active issues that represent significant future work and current challenges.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Kona/Cannon Integration:** Planning for the integration of Kona with Cannon continued across multiple issues. Discussions centered on ensuring OPCM can deploy the new game type ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17285)) and defining how the `cannon-kona` type will be represented in the `standard-prestates.toml` file ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17283)).
    - **P2P Networking Bug:** A significant bug was discussed where `ConfigureGossip` can overwrite default settings with zero values, leading to potential panics in `go-libp2p-pubsub` ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17308)). Proposed solutions include creating a default configuration method to ensure valid parameters.
    - **Developer Experience & CI/CD:** A conversation around improving the CircleCI configuration is ongoing, with ideas to make high-value jobs like `kurtosis` and `go-tests-short` easier to run locally. The possibility of dynamically sorting Go tests by execution time to optimize test runs was also explored ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17184)).
    - **Testing & Compatibility:** The issue for enhancing the sync tester was reopened, with a new focus on testing every OP Stack Hard Fork transition ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16703)). Separately, a potential compatibility issue with Go 1.25 remains a concern for Cannon, as the latest point release (1.25.1) does not appear to include the required MIPS fix ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17060)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
While there were no new pull requests to review, collaboration was evident within the detailed discussions on active issues. The community's focus was on architectural planning and debugging complex problems. The active threads on Kona/Cannon integration, P2P gossip configuration, and CI/CD improvements show a high degree of engagement from core contributors in shaping the future direction and stability of the OP Stack.
