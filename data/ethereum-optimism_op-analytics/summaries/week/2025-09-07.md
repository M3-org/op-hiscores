# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's key achievement was the successful deployment and stabilization of flashblocks on mainnet sequencers, a significant step for the protocol's infrastructure. This rollout was supported by enhancements to sequencer health monitoring, including the deployment of `op-conductor` with new EL p2p healthchecks to ensure robust operation. Alongside this major deployment, the team also performed important maintenance by deprecating and removing obsolete smoke tests related to the dispute protocol. Looking ahead, new work has begun on performance enhancements for `op-program` and expanding contract upgrade test coverage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on a major mainnet deployment and associated stability improvements.

- **Flashblocks Mainnet Deployment**
  A multi-stage effort to enable flashblocks on mainnet sequencers was successfully completed. After an initial evaluation on a single sequencer, flashblocks were rolled out across the remaining sequencers. Related work included merging supporting PRs and resolving alerts for low peer counts on the newly enabled sequencers, ensuring a stable deployment ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16759), [#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16760), [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17317), [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16868)).

- **Sequencer Health and Alerting**
  To bolster sequencer reliability, `op-conductor` was released and deployed with new EL p2p healthchecks ([#17153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17153)). An issue causing false alerts for unhealthy non-flashblocks enabled sequencers was also resolved, refining the accuracy of the monitoring system ([#17143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17143)).

- **Test Suite and Infrastructure Maintenance**
  A series of outdated smoke tests for dispute components, including `op-challenger`, `op-dispute-mon`, and `op-proposer`, were closed as they are no longer required ([#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/140), [#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/141), [#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/142), [#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/143)). Additionally, an issue regarding Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy was closed with the decision not to implement it ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17194)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on completing the flashblocks deployment while initiating new performance and testing enhancements.

- **Closed Issues:**
  The primary focus of closed issues was the successful flashblocks deployment and the resolution of associated stability alerts. Significant housekeeping was also completed with the deprecation of multiple obsolete smoke tests for the dispute protocol. Several minor infrastructure and documentation issues were also closed, clearing the backlog.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  Development has shifted towards future enhancements, with two notable issues gaining immediate traction:
  - **`op-program` Performance:** A proposal was made to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookups in `op-program` specs to improve performance ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17416)). A draft PR is already open and under discussion.
  - **CI Test Coverage:** To improve testing robustness, a new issue was opened to add `soneium` to the contract upgrade tests in CI ([#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17332)). A PR to implement this has already been submitted.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development pace this week was characterized by a tight feedback loop between issue creation and implementation. New proposals for enhancing `op-program` ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17416)) and expanding test coverage ([#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17332)) were both met with immediate draft pull requests. This indicates active collaboration and a proactive approach to moving the project forward, with discussions quickly translating into tangible code.
