# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Jun 8 - 14, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's focus was on significantly enhancing the data pipeline's ability to ingest Superchain-native information. Development centered on integrating data directly from the Superchain Registry and on-chain contracts, providing a more accurate and consolidated view of chain configurations. Alongside these new features, a critical bug in the BigQuery function for updating L1 costs was resolved. Concurrently, a major effort continued to investigate and improve CI test flakiness, with the introduction of new reporting tools to aid debugging.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on expanding data sources and ensuring the reliability of existing pipelines.

- **Superchain Data Integration:** A major push was made to enrich the analytics platform with data from across the Superchain. This included pulling the chain address list ([#1641](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1641)) and the full chain list ([#1642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1642)) from the Superchain Registry. A new `build_all_chains_metadata()` pipeline was introduced to aggregate metadata ([#1629](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1629)), and work was completed to pull system configuration data directly from on-chain contracts ([#1646](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1646)).

- **Data Pipeline Bug Fix:** A bug was fixed in the BigQuery series function, which was preventing accurate updates to table fields. This correction ensures the reliability of data updates, particularly for L1 costs ([#1643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1643)).

- **Infrastructure Updates:** The project's data orchestration layer was kept up-to-date with two separate updates to the Dagster version ([#1644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1644), [#1647](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1647)), ensuring access to the latest features and stability improvements.

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:** Two issues were resolved this week. One clarified that the `L2OutputOracleProxy` is deprecated, closing an issue related to an outdated tutorial ([#1614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1614)). The other addressed a module import error in `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` that was causing build failures ([#1146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1146)).

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, but several active issues saw significant discussion:
    - **CI Flakiness:** The investigation into CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16271), [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16378)) was a major focus. Discussions highlighted that most flakiness is due to infrastructure rather than the tests themselves. A key development was the creation and sharing of a "Flakiness Report" to better identify problematic tests and jobs.
    - **`op-supervisor` Stability:** Critical discussions continued around the `op-supervisor`. One thread focused on how it should handle L1 origin validity during resets ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16315)), while another addressed a crash-loop caused by event overflow when the unsafe head gap is large ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16335)).
    - **Incorrect Nonce Bug:** A long-standing issue regarding `eth_getTransactionCount` returning an incorrect nonce for pending transactions ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/623)) received renewed attention, with a request for an update on the investigation.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the focused discussions on complex technical challenges. The effort to tackle CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16271), [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16378)) involved multiple contributors like `scharissis` and `nonsense`, demonstrating a collective commitment to improving developer infrastructure. Similarly, deep technical debates on `op-supervisor` behavior ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16315), [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16335)) saw active participation from `sebastianst`, `nonsense`, and `axelKingsley`, showcasing collaborative problem-solving on core protocol components. The planning for a Superchain Interop quickstart guide ([#1644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1644)) also highlighted teamwork aimed at enhancing developer experience.
