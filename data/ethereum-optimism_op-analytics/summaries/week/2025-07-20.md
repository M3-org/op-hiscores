# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were heavily focused on enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the data analytics pipeline. Key activities included immediate fixes to data ingestion, such as temporarily excluding Ethereum from Goldsky to resolve downstream failures, and proactive enhancements like adding a new notebook for DefiLlama backfills. The team also refined core logic by correcting L2 priority fee calculations and updating transaction models. Concurrently, significant progress was made in closing out older issues related to Flashblocks deployment and runbook finalization, clearing the way for future work.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on data pipeline maintenance, bug fixes, and tooling updates.

- **Data Pipeline Integrity and Enhancements:**
  - To address downstream model failures, Ethereum was temporarily excluded from Goldsky, and schema columns were reordered to ensure data integrity ([#1701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1701), [#1702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1702)).
  - A new notebook was introduced to support full data backfills from DefiLlama, improving data analysis capabilities ([#1703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1703)). A subsequent bug fix was quickly implemented for this new notebook ([#1705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1705)).
  - A bug fix was merged to correct discrepancies in L2 priority fee calculations ([#1704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1704)).
  - Refined transaction models were updated across the codebase ([#1709](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1709)).

- **Tooling and Infrastructure:**
  - The Dagster version was bumped in the project's `Makefile` and Helm chart values, keeping the orchestration tool up to date ([#1708](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1708), [#1710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1710)).
  - Changes were made to CircleCI push configurations affecting metadata utilities and tracking notebooks ([#1707](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1707)).
  - Work began on a new chain metadata aggregator, with the first pull request for data loaders being opened ([#1706](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1706)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a productive push to resolve outstanding issues while continuing discussions on key infrastructure needs.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks Deployment:** Progress was made on Flashblocks integration, with issues related to enabling it on op-sepolia and configuring nodes being closed in favor of new milestones and tasks ([#16544](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16544), [#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16496)).
  - **Runbook Finalization:** The "Runbook v3 final review" was completed and the issue closed. The runbooks were renamed to clearly indicate the upgrade versions they cover, improving documentation clarity ([#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16651)).
  - **Node Management:** An issue regarding improvements to `op-supervisor` and `op-node` reset functionality was closed, as most action items were addressed and upcoming refactoring will supersede the remaining points ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16314)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were reported during this period.
  - The most notable active issue is **"op-e2e: Configurable DA type for interop SuperSystem"** ([#15406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15406)). It was briefly closed by automation but immediately reopened, highlighting an ongoing need for a batcher that posts data using blobs for interop testing, a key requirement for future development.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development activity this week indicates a highly responsive and collaborative environment. The rapid bug fix for the newly introduced DefiLlama notebook ([#1705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1705)) demonstrates a tight feedback loop within the team. Furthermore, active discussions on issues like [#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16314) and [#15406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15406) show a commitment to collaborative problem-solving around core infrastructure and testing capabilities. The team also showed vigilance in monitoring project automation, as seen with the quick correction of an incorrectly closed issue.
