# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week saw a significant expansion of analytical capabilities with the integration of "jovian analysis" tooling, providing new methods for data usage and gas limit analysis. The data pipeline underwent substantial refinement, with a focus on improving data quality for account abstraction, optimizing performance for Dune queries, and implementing critical bug fixes for l2beat data schemas. On the protocol front, the `min-base-fee` specification was formally ratified, marking a key milestone. Discussions around future architectural changes, such as deprecating the req-resp P2P sync mechanism in `op-node`, and improving developer tooling like `op-deployer` were also prominent.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on enhancing the project's analytical toolkit and ensuring the stability and accuracy of the data pipeline.

-   **Expansion of Analytical Capabilities**: A comprehensive suite of tools for "jovian analysis" was added to the repository, including core Python scripts for data fetching and analysis, along with Jupyter notebooks for ad-hoc investigations ([#1728](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1728)). These new tools were quickly refined to improve base fee display and chart visualizations ([#1735](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1735), [#1737](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1737)).

-   **Data Pipeline Integrity and Optimization**:
    -   **Data Quality:** Significant effort was invested in improving data quality checks for account abstraction, adding regression tests for reverted user operations ([#1732](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1732)) and relaxing checks for failed operations to prevent false positives ([#1738](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1738)).
    -   **Bug Fixes & Refinements:** A critical bug was fixed in the schema migration for l2beat TVS breakdown data ([#1730](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1730)). The pipeline was also updated to exclude Celo from pending batches to improve data specificity ([#1727](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1727)).
    -   **Performance:** A change was introduced to reduce the run time for the "All Transactions" data query on Dune Analytics, improving efficiency ([#1729](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1729)).

-   **Infrastructure and Maintenance**: The analytics pipeline's core dependencies were updated with a bump to Dagster ([#1734](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1734), [#1739](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1739)). OP Mainnet Explorer links were updated across the codebase ([#1715](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1715)), and a minor duplicate issue in the CircleCI configuration was resolved ([#1736](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1736)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

-   **Closed Issues:** The most significant closure was the ratification of the `min-base-fee` feature specification, finalizing a key piece of protocol development ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/742)). Several internal tracking and cleanup issues were also resolved, including a postmortem of a scalar fix ([#17012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17012)) and logging cleanup in `op-up` ([#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17007)). Strategic decisions were made to deprioritize adding challenger support to `op-up` ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17005)) and flashblocks support in Kurtosis ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16514)).

-   **New & Active Issues:** Discussions this week highlighted several key areas for future work:
    -   **`op-deployer` Enhancements:** A major ongoing effort is the migration of `op-deployer` to use Forge, with a tracking issue ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17213)) and several sub-tasks attracting community interest. Separately, the need for clearer documentation for `op-deployer` was a major topic, with a comprehensive documentation overhaul in progress to address feedback from external chain operators ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1530)).
    -   **`op-node` Sync Mechanism:** A significant architectural discussion is underway regarding the deprecation of the req-resp P2P sync mechanism in `op-node` ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/14108)). An alternative, simpler unsafe block sync mechanism has been prototyped, which could improve recovery times and simplify operations.
    -   **User Support:** Troubleshooting `op-proposer` failures due to misconfiguration of the game type ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/13502)) continues to be an active area of community support.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week demonstrated healthy collaboration between the core team and the wider community.

-   Community member `tooshiNoko` showed strong initiative by expressing interest in tackling multiple issues related to the migration of `op-deployer` to Forge, coordinating with the team to avoid duplicate work ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17213)).
-   The active discussion around improving `op-deployer` documentation ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1530)) highlights a productive feedback loop, with comments from several external users directly influencing a major documentation update.
-   Community members actively helped each other troubleshoot common issues, as seen in the `op-proposer` configuration thread ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/13502)), where users shared solutions to resolve transaction creation failures.
