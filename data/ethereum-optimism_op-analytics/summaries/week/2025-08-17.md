# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on enhancing data integrity and core infrastructure. A critical bug fix was merged to correct the stablecoin data schema, ensuring data accuracy, while new work was initiated to evolve this schema further. On the infrastructure front, a significant milestone was reached with the confirmation that flashblocks are now successfully enabled on all Sunnyside sequencers for Sepolia. Efforts also included code cleanup and addressing issues related to test logging and outdated documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving the data schema and general code quality.

- **Stablecoin Schema Integrity:** A key bug fix ([#1725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1725)) was implemented to ensure the successful execution of the stablecoin schema, directly addressing data integrity. This was complemented by a new proposal to evolve the stablecoin schema ([#1724](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1724)), indicating a continued focus on refining this data source.

- **Code Maintenance:** A pull request ([#1726](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1726)) was opened for general code cleanup, aiming to improve readability by removing redundant words from the codebase.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management saw the resolution of key infrastructure and tooling problems, while discussion continues on content audits.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks on Sunnyside:** The effort to enable flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers was successfully closed ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16688)). It was confirmed that all voting and non-voting sequencers for Sepolia are running with Flashblocks, and failover has been tested.
    - **Acceptance Test Logging:** An issue regarding missing logs in `op-acceptance-tests` was resolved ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17151)) after the logs were located. Work is ongoing to improve the workflow for better log capture in the future.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened during this period.
    - The content audit issue ([#1673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1673)) remains active. A recent comment requested clarification on the specific page needing updates for outdated information on MOVE token utility and DAO governance, indicating the triage process is ongoing.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active management of issues. For instance, issue [#1673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1673) saw direct communication from a maintainer (`krofax`) seeking clarification from the issue reporter to move the content audit forward. This highlights the team's process of engaging with community feedback to maintain documentation accuracy.
