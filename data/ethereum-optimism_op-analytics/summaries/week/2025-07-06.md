# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Jul 6 - 12, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant enhancements to the project's data analytics infrastructure. Development focused heavily on upgrading the Dagster data pipeline for improved stability and functionality, including enabling easier backfilling of native transfers. The Revshare transfer logic was also substantially overhauled to capture a wider range of transfers across all Superchain networks, improving data accuracy and completeness. Additionally, several key technical discussions regarding Interoperability logic and precompile address states were concluded, providing important clarity for future development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the robustness and scope of the analytics data pipelines.

- **Dagster Pipeline Upgrades and Streamlining**
  A series of updates modernized the Dagster data pipeline. This included multiple version bumps to enhance stability and functionality ([#1672](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1672), [#1673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1673), [#1675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1675), [#1676](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1676), [#1677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1677)). A new feature was added to allow backfilling of native transfers directly through the Dagster UI ([#1674](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1674)). To streamline ingestion, the decommissioned Kroma chain was removed from the process, preventing it from blocking deployments ([#1671](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1671)).

- **Revshare Transfer Logic Enhancements**
  The Revshare analytics system received a major upgrade to improve data accuracy and coverage. The logic was expanded to capture all inbound transfers, not just those from known revshare addresses, which will help identify unmapped addresses ([#1678](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1678), [#1679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1679)). Support was also extended to all chains across the Superchain ecosystem ([#1680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1680)), and a critical bug in the data insertion logic was fixed ([#1681](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1681)).

- **Chain Metadata Expansion**
  The project's dataset was expanded with the addition of new CGT (Contracts/Governance/Tokens) data for Celo and Frax chains ([#1683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1683)).

- **Future Refactoring Initiated**
  A new pull request ([#1684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1684)) was opened to begin refactoring the existing token and CGT structures, signaling upcoming work to improve data modeling.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Discussions this week led to the resolution of several issues related to core protocol mechanics and configuration.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Interop Logic and Configuration:** Two key issues related to Interoperability were closed. A proposal to add a pre-Interop logic mode to `op-node` ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16520)) was closed after being deprioritized. A discussion on validating `CrossL2Inbox` configuration in the L2 genesis state ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15765)) concluded that the risk is better mitigated by genesis generation tooling (`op-deployer`) rather than adding complexity to execution clients.
  - **Flashblocks Test Validation:** An issue to update flashblocks gate acceptance tests ([#16630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16630)) was opened and immediately closed.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were opened this week.
  - An active discussion on issue [#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16620) provided important clarification regarding precompile addresses (0x00-0xff). It was confirmed that their 1 wei balance is expected behavior within the OP Stack, due to rules around how empty accounts are handled, and does not indicate an anomaly.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week saw focused, collaborative efforts on specific feature sets. The rapid succession of merged pull requests for both the Dagster pipeline and Revshare logic indicates tightly coordinated work by the development team. Core contributors `tynes` and `ajsutton` were instrumental in driving discussions to a conclusion on several technical issues ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16520), [#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16620), [#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15765)), providing clarity and direction that unblocks future development.
