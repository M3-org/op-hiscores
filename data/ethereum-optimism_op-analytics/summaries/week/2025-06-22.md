# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push to enhance Superchain operational tooling, with a large number of long-standing issues related to `Superchain-Ops`, CI/CD, and task management being resolved. This cleanup effort improves developer experience and streamlines operations. While development work focused on minor refinements to analytics notebooks, important new issues were raised concerning `op-supervisor` performance and a broken dependency. Active community collaboration was prominent in diagnosing an `op-geth` CPU usage anomaly and discussing improvements to `op-supervisor` reset logic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development work involved minor updates to analytics notebooks for tracking activity on other chains.

*   **Analytics Notebook Refinements:** Modifications were made to the `get_all_txs.ipynb` and `pull_l2_activity.ipynb` notebooks ([#1661](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1661), [#1662](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1662)). These changes likely refine the process of transaction data retrieval and processing for cross-chain analysis.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a major effort in closing out a backlog of issues, particularly around tooling, while new performance and dependency issues were identified.

*   **Closed Issues:** A substantial number of issues were closed, marking significant progress in several areas:
    *   **Superchain-Ops Tooling:** Numerous enhancements were completed, including support for "stacked" proposals ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/342)), improved simulation functionality ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/448)), refined task architecture ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/636)), and the ability to read addresses for chains not in the Superchain Registry ([#923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/923)).
    *   **CI/CD & Testing:** The CI pipeline was improved by speeding up `template_regression_tests` ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/648)) and enabling automatic task runs ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/337)).
    *   **Developer Experience & Onboarding:** Work was completed to improve user experience with nonce overrides ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/770)), provide state diffs in markdown ([#777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/777)), and finalize training for the new Superchain-Ops tooling ([#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/514)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **New Issues:** A bug was reported for a broken `go-bip39` dependency in `op-chain-ops` ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16612)). An investigation was also opened into event spikes in `op-supervisor`, suggesting potential congestion or deadlocks ([#16603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16603)).
    *   **`op-geth` CPU Usage:** The discussion around abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/613)) continued. The community is actively collaborating, with users providing `pprof` files for diagnosis. The prevailing theory is that the high usage is a temporary effect of a log indexing rebuild in a recent `go-ethereum` backport.
    *   **`op-supervisor` Reset Behavior:** There is an ongoing technical discussion about improving the `op-supervisor`'s reset and L1 origin handling ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16314), [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16315)). The goal is to ensure the supervisor validates L1 origins for all safety levels before sending reset requests to `op-node`, thus avoiding redundant checks.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was strong this week, particularly in issue diagnosis and improvement proposals.
*   The `op-geth` CPU usage issue ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/613)) served as a prime example of collaborative problem-solving, with multiple users sharing diagnostic data and theories to pinpoint the cause.
*   There is clear community interest in contributing to code quality, as seen in the discussion for issue [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/781), where several individuals offered to help refactor a function to reduce noisy terminal output.
*   The closure of the training issue for Superchain-Ops tooling ([#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/514)) indicates successful knowledge sharing and onboarding efforts within the ecosystem.
