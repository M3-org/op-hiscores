# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Nov 23 - 29, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts focused on enhancing analytical capabilities and performing critical infrastructure maintenance. A new tool was introduced for EIP-1559 base fee market analysis, enabling deeper insights into fee dynamics. Alongside this new feature, routine security updates were completed with the rotation of authentication secrets. A significant investigation is also underway into a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recover mode, which could impact chain stability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on adding new analytical tools and ensuring system security.

- **Fee Market Analysis Tooling:** A new tool was developed to analyze the EIP-1559 base fee market ([#1768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1768)). This contribution includes an analysis notebook, a core script, and helper functions designed to model the next block's expected base fee based on the gas usage of previous blocks.

- **Security Maintenance:** Authentication secrets were rotated in the `helm/dagster` and `k8s` configurations to maintain security best practices ([#1769](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1769)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The focus of issue management this week was on a critical, ongoing investigation.

- **Closed Issues:** Based on the available data, no issues were reported as closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. However, significant discussion continued on a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recover mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18350)). The issue describes a scenario where a sequencer in recover mode on a healthy chain might request an L1 origin block that doesn't exist yet, leading to "not found" errors. This behavior could prevent the L1 origin from advancing and potentially violate the sequencer drift rule. A code snippet was proposed as a potential fix, but the investigation is ongoing to understand the root cause.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was primarily focused on diagnosing the critical sequencer bug. The ongoing discussion in issue [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18350) highlights a concerted effort to understand and resolve this complex problem.
