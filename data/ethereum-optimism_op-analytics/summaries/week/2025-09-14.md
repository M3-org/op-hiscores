# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on enhancing data accuracy and resolving critical infrastructure tasks. Key developments included a bug fix to improve transaction tracking and a refinement in the Jovian analysis framework for more precise data availability size estimations. Significant progress was also made in closing out preparatory work, with the completion of Flashblocks load testing, `op-acceptor` improvements, and a threat modeling analysis for the Data Availability Footprint Limit. Active discussions continue on future work, notably around `op-node` preparations for the Fusaka upgrade.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on bug fixes and improving the precision of core analytics.

- **Transaction Tracking Bug Fix:** A bug in the `alltxs` functionality was resolved by updating the `get_all_txs.ipynb` script, ensuring more comprehensive transaction tracking ([#1746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1746)).
- **Jovian Analysis Refinement:** To improve the accuracy of data availability (DA) size estimates, the calculation was modified to exclude deposit transactions from the analysis ([#1745](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1745)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
Several key issues were resolved, marking the completion of important testing and analysis tasks:

- **Flashblocks Readiness:** Work concluded on load testing Flashblocks on devnets ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16756)) and evaluating partner support criteria on eris-0 to confirm performance against SLAs ([#16765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16765)).
- **`op-acceptor` Improvements:** Two issues related to `op-acceptor` were closed, delivering improved configuration logging at startup ([#461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/461)) and fixing sub-optimal package parallelism ([#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/462)).
- **Security Analysis:** A threat modeling and failure modes analysis for the DA Footprint Limit was completed and documented ([#336](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/336)).

### New & Active Issues
No new issues were opened this week. However, several active discussions point to ongoing and future work:

- **`op-node` Fusaka Preparation:** A notable discussion in issue [#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17493) raised concerns about tight coupling with upstream Geth code, which could complicate future `op-geth` or `op-node` releases.
- **Receipt Decoding:** A fix has been proposed and is under testing for an RLP receipt decoding failure, with user feedback suggesting the latest patch may resolve it ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/679)).
- **Dispute Game Refactor:** A discussion is underway to clarify the scope of a proposed refactor for the dispute game creator pattern and determine if it overlaps with existing work ([#17436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17436)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the active issue discussions, which highlighted proactive planning and a healthy feedback loop. The conversation around `op-node` preparations for Fusaka ([#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17493)) demonstrates forward-thinking architectural consideration among contributors. Similarly, the dialogue on the receipt decoding error ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/679)) shows effective collaboration between developers and users to test and confirm fixes.
