# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was defined by a major push to expand and fortify the Superchain data analytics pipeline. Key achievements include the integration of a new platform metrics pipeline, the addition of Celo chain support, and the inclusion of Ethereum data via Goldsky. While expanding data sources, the team also focused on quality, implementing fixes for external API changes from L2Beat and Dune and introducing a new manual mapping system for chain metadata. These advancements were temporarily balanced by the need to disable block batch processing for Ethereum and Celo to investigate ingestion issues, highlighting a focus on data integrity over raw speed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on enhancing the breadth, quality, and reliability of data ingestion for Superchain analytics.

**Data Pipeline Expansion & Integration**
The project's data coverage was significantly broadened by integrating new chains and metrics.
- A new pipeline was established to pull platform metrics into the BigQuery database ([#1616](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1616)), and this job was subsequently scheduled for regular execution ([#1693](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1693)).
- Support was added for the Celo chain, including backfilling capabilities ([#1694](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1694)).
- Ethereum was added to the Goldsky data ingestion process, further expanding the scope of Superchain analytics ([#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1696)).

**Data Quality and Formatting Fixes**
Several updates were merged to improve data accuracy and consistency.
- A critical fix was implemented to correct the `provider` field mapping for BigQuery insertions ([#1691](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1691)).
- Adjustments were made to handle API changes from L2Beat and Dune, ensuring continued data accuracy ([#1685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1685), [#1688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1688)).
- A new configuration-driven manual mapping system was introduced to improve chain metadata transformations ([#1682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1682)).
- Data writes were aligned with current schemas by converting lists to comma-separated values ([#1686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1686)).

**Pipeline Maintenance and Adjustments**
To ensure stability during the expansion, proactive maintenance was performed.
- Block batch processing was temporarily turned off for Ethereum ([#1699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1699)) and Celo ([#1698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1698)) to address non-standard chain behavior and investigate ingestion processes.
- Multiple version bumps were made to support Dagster deployments ([#1687](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1687), [#1689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1689), [#1690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op
