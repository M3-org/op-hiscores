# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on maintenance, optimization, and strategic planning. A key effort involved a thorough review of technical debt, resulting in several older issues across `op-devstack`, `op-supervisor`, and `Interop` being reopened to address outstanding cleanup tasks. The successful rollout of Superchain Registry 2.0 continued to pay dividends, allowing for the closure of several legacy issues related to chain tooling and CI. Concurrently, analytics scripts were optimized for efficiency, and important discussions on `op-node` syncing led to a strategic decision to defer certain fixes until the deprecation of request/response sync is complete.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this period focused on improving the efficiency of existing analytics infrastructure.

- **Analytics Script Optimization:** An effort was made to streamline data processing and reduce resource usage within the `other_chains_tracking` module. The run frequency for the `get_desybil_wallets.ipynb` and `get_qualified_txs.ipynb` scripts was reduced, indicating a successful optimization of these data pipelines ([#1765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1765)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management was a major focus, characterized by diligent cleanup of old tasks and strategic planning for future work.

- **Closed Issues:** The benefits of the Superchain Registry 2.0 refactor were evident as several related issues were closed. This includes enhancements to the `add-chain` tool for hardforks ([#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/610)), improvements to CI validation summaries ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/644)), and the deprecation of a now-irrelevant L2 key handover test ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/643)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Technical Debt Cleanup:** A significant effort was undertaken to address lingering `TODOs` from previous refactors. A series of issues were reopened to ensure complete cleanup, including fixing the address book in `op-devstack` ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15817)), removing the anchor point RPC in `Interop` ([#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16140)), dropping multi-node support in `op-supervisor` ([#16174](https://github.comcom/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16174)), and cleaning up comments from the event system refactor ([#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16917)).
    - **`op-node` Syncing Strategy:** Active discussions on several `op-node` issues related to syncing behavior during EL Sync ([#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17631)), safe head advancement ([#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18124)), and unsafe head rewinds ([#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18125)) concluded with a strategic decision. These fixes will be deferred until the request/response (RR) sync mechanism is fully deprecated to avoid redundant work.
    - **Design Finalization:** The design for `fusaka-on-l2` ([#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/355)) is awaiting finalization pending customer feedback.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The activity this week highlights strong internal collaboration and a focus on code quality and long-term maintenance. Contributor `ajsutton` demonstrated diligence by systematically reviewing and reopening issues with outstanding `TODOs`, driving a crucial technical debt cleanup initiative. Meanwhile, `mslipper` provided strategic direction on complex `op-node` issues, aligning bug-fixing efforts with the larger roadmap item of deprecating RR sync. This coordination ensures that development resources are applied effectively toward the project's long-term goals.
