# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the stability and accuracy of core analytics components. Key progress was made in refining collective balance calculations and wallet configurations to improve financial reporting for the Optimism Collective. Concurrently, the team successfully resolved critical stability issues related to Flashblocks and advanced discussions on improving the resilience of the dispute monitor when dealing with out-of-sync nodes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving financial accuracy and addressing data handling within the analytics suite.

- **Collective Economics and Financial Reporting**
  Improvements were made to the collective balance calculations and revenue wallet configurations. This work, captured in PRs [#1755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1755) and [#1754](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1754), aims to ensure more accurate financial reporting for the Optimism Collective.

- **Data Parsing Enhancements**
  A new pull request ([#1753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1753)) was opened to address issues with DataFrame mapping and datetime parsing, signaling ongoing efforts to improve data integrity and processing.

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks Stability:** Two critical issues, [#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17856) and [#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17857), were closed, indicating the successful resolution of problems related to lost Flashblocks and coordination with RPC providers.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Dispute Monitor Resilience:** Significant discussion occurred in [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17814) regarding how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync rollup RPC nodes. The current consensus is to use the highest L2 block as the expected head and ignore results from nodes that are behind, enhancing the monitor's reliability. The issue was temporarily closed and reopened to facilitate the merging of an associated pull request.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
