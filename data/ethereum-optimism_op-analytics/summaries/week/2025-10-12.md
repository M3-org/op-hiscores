# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the financial accuracy and operational stability of the Optimism ecosystem. Key developments included improvements to the Collective's balance calculations and revenue wallet configurations to ensure more precise financial reporting. Concurrently, critical stability issues concerning the Flashblocks proxy and RPC provider coordination were successfully resolved. Ongoing technical discussions focused on improving the resilience of the dispute monitoring service, specifically how it should handle out-of-sync nodes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on refining economic calculations and addressing data parsing, while also resolving infrastructure stability.

### Collective Economics Adjustments
To improve the accuracy of financial reporting for the Optimism Collective, work was completed to refine collective balance calculations and update revenue wallet configurations. This included a bug fix in PR [#1755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1755) and related adjustments in PR [#1754](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1754).

### Data Handling Improvements
A new pull request, [#1753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1753), was opened to address issues related to DataFrame mapping and datetime parsing, aiming to improve data processing pipelines.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving infrastructure problems and defining behavior for core monitoring tools.

- **Closed Issues:** Two critical issues related to Flashblocks stability were closed. The resolutions in [#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17856) and [#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17857) addressed problems with lost Flashblocks and coordination with RPC providers.

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened this week. However, there was significant discussion on the active issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17814) concerning the `op-dispute-mon` service. The conversation centered on establishing a clear strategy for handling out-of-sync rollup RPC nodes, with the proposed solution being to use the highest L2 block as the expected head and ignore results from nodes that are behind.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active discussion around the `op-dispute-mon` service in issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17814). The temporary closure and reopening of the issue to facilitate an associated PR merge highlights coordination efforts to advance the solution.
