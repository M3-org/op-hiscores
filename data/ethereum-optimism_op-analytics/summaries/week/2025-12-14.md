# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity was centered on intensive discussion, triage, and architectural planning rather than new feature implementation. While no code was merged, significant progress was made in identifying and diagnosing critical issues, including a `nil pointer dereference` in `op-challenger` and a fuzzing-related bug in `OptimismPortal2`. Key discussions focused on the design of the fault-proof system, node stability, and performance optimizations. Meanwhile, work continues on preparing data for RetroPGF analytics and finalizing the upcoming Upgrade 18 release.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
While no pull requests were merged this week, progress was made on the data analytics front with new work being proposed.

*   **RetroPGF Data Preparation:** A new pull request ([#1774](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1774)) was opened to add CSV data dumps for RetroPGF Seasons 7 and 8. This continues the effort to provide valuable data for public goods funding analysis.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week based on the provided data. The focus was on diagnosing new and existing problems, with several critical issues being prioritized.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Critical Bugs Identified:** Two high-priority bugs are under active investigation. A `nil pointer dereference` panic in `op-challenger` ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18608)) was identified as a serious issue affecting L1 nodes that do not support blob transactions. Additionally, a critical bug in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18554)) was discovered through fuzzing, related to incorrect handling of zero-address deposits.
    *   **Node Stability and Performance:** Discussions continued around node synchronization failures ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581)), with evidence pointing to the L1 Execution Client failing to provide necessary state data. Flaky P2P connections between `op-reth` and `op-geth` ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18570)) are impacting system test stability. Performance optimization for `kona-sp1` ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18533)) is also being tracked, focusing on offloading expensive operations.
    *   **Protocol Design & Release Finalization:** A key architectural discussion is underway regarding the fault-proof system ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18574)), weighing the necessity of an injected replacement transaction against potential protocol simplifications. The finalization of Upgrade 18 ([#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18548)) is being monitored, pending governance approval and successful testnet runs.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week was marked by deep technical collaboration across several critical issues. User `@rdin777` played a central role in triaging and diagnosing a wide range of problems, from critical bugs to release blockers.

The architectural debate around the fault-proof system ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18574)) showcased active discussion between core contributors like `@ajsutton`, `@axelKingsley`, and `@Inphi`. Community members also provided valuable input, with `@lyh169` helping to confirm the root cause of the `op-challenger` panic ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18608)) and `@tsulhc` sharing a potential workaround for node synchronization issues ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581)).
