# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity was characterized by a significant focus on debugging and resolving critical stability and security issues. While no new features were merged, intensive discussions took place to address several high-priority problems, including a fuzzing test failure, P2P connection flakiness, and a panic in `op-challenger`. This indicates a period of stabilization and hardening of the protocol. In parallel, work was initiated to improve data accessibility for RetroPGF, and strategic discussions continued around ZK proof optimization and the finalization of the upcoming U18 release.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Based on the available data, no pull requests were merged or work completed during this reporting period. The team's development efforts were concentrated on investigating and discussing active issues.

A new pull request was opened to enhance public goods funding analysis:
- **RetroPGF Data Accessibility**: PR [#1774](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1774) was opened to add CSV dumps for RetroPGF Seasons 7 and 8, making this data more accessible to the community.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No issues were closed during this period. The focus was on triaging and diagnosing a number of critical new and active issues.

**New & Active Issues:**
Discussions were centered on several key areas, with a strong emphasis on system stability and security:

- **Critical Bug Investigation**: A significant portion of effort was directed at high-priority bugs.
    - **`op-challenger` Panic**: A critical `nil pointer dereference` in `op-challenger` ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18608)) was identified, occurring when connected to an L1 node that does not support Dencun blob transactions. A patch is being expedited.
    - **Fuzzing Test Failure**: A critical security flaw was found in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18554)), which is being prioritized for an immediate fix to ensure correct L1/L2 bridge operation.
    - **Node Stability**: Efforts are underway to diagnose and fix P2P connection flakiness between `op-reth` and `op-geth` nodes ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18570)) and to debug node synchronization failures causing "missing trie node" errors ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18581)).

- **Protocol Design & Optimization**:
    - **Interop Transactions**: A debate is ongoing in [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18574) regarding the necessity of injected replacement transactions, weighing protocol simplicity against the needs of the fault-proof system.
    - **ZK Proofs**: Discussion continued on optimizing ZK proofs for `kona-sp1` by offloading expensive operations like keccak to the host ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18533)).

- **Release Coordination**: An update was requested on the status of the U18 release, specifically regarding governance approval for `op-program` and any blocking issues found on the testnet ([#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18548)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week saw active collaboration focused on triaging critical issues. Contributor `rdin777` played a key coordination role, driving discussions across multiple high-priority issues by requesting updates, clarifying severity, and asking for diagnostic information.

There was notable technical debate in issue [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18574), where contributors `inphi`, `axelKingsley`, and `ajsutton` discussed the trade-offs of a proposed change to interop transaction handling, showcasing a healthy process of collaborative protocol design. The overall activity reflects a community rallying to ensure the stability and security of the system.
