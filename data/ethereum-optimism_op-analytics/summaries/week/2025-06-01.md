# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Jun 1 - 7, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on architectural discussions and issue refinement for core fault proof components, with no new code contributions. The primary focus was on improving the robustness of the `op-supervisor` and its interaction with the `op-challenger`. Key discussions revolved around enhancing the supervisor's reset logic to validate L1 origin and resolving its inability to provide fault proof data for non-genesis interop scenarios. This period reflects a strong emphasis on planning and design before implementation, particularly for features critical to upcoming devnet deployments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, there were no new features, bug fixes, or other code-level changes merged this week. All development activity was concentrated in the issue discussion and planning stages. No new pull requests were opened.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week's focus was on defining and resolving issues related to the fault proof system, with no issues being closed.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Supervisor & Challenger Enhancements:** A significant portion of the week's activity was dedicated to the `op-supervisor` and `op-challenger`. A new issue, **[#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16315)**, was opened to improve the `op-supervisor`'s reset logic. The proposal suggests that the supervisor should be responsible for verifying the L1 origin of a reset target, simplifying the logic and reducing communication with the `op-node`. Concurrently, discussions continued on **[#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16166)**, which addresses the `op-challenger`'s difficulty with non-genesis activation blocks. The consensus is shifting towards a fix within the `op-supervisor` to index its safe DB differently, a solution deemed critical before moving to devnets.
    *   **Incorrect Nonce Reporting:** A user followed up on issue **[#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/623)**, which reports that `eth_getTransactionCount` returns an incorrect nonce for pending transactions on a Base node, causing transactions to become stuck.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident through active discussions on GitHub issues rather than through code reviews. The detailed back-and-forth on issues like **[#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16166)** and **[#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16315)** indicates a collaborative effort among core contributors to refine system architecture and resolve complex bugs before writing code. Additionally, the follow-up from a user on issue **[#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/623)** highlights ongoing engagement between the project and its user base.
