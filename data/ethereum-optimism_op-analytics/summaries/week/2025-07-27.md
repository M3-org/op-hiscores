# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts in `op-analytics` centered on enhancing data ingestion pipelines and expanding analytical capabilities. A significant new feature was the integration with Dune to pull top EVM contract data, immediately followed by maintenance updates to keep this data current. The team also improved ad-hoc analysis tooling by adding a new notebook for flashblocks analysis and updating existing ones. Meanwhile, important forward-looking discussions continued around protocol-level improvements, including the "Min Base Fee" initiative and congestion-based transaction reordering, indicating a dual focus on immediate data enhancements and long-term design.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving the data sources and analytical tools available within the repository.

- **Dune Data Integration:** A new data ingestion process was established to pull top EVM contracts from Dune, enhancing the project's external data sources ([#1711](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1711)). This was followed by a maintenance update to ensure the Dune Top Contracts data remains current ([#1712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1712)).

- **Analytics Notebooks:** The repository's analytical tooling was expanded with the addition of a new notebook for flashblocks analysis ([#1714](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1714)). Existing notebooks for daily aggregated traces and transactions were also modified and updated ([#1713](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1713)).

- **Data Pipeline Refinements:** A refinement was made to the data processing pipeline to exclude Celo and Ethereum data from being published by certain models, as they are not yet ready for that stage ([#1716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1716)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened this week, but progress was made on existing ones.

- **Closed Issues:** A long-standing documentation issue ([#1401](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1401)) requesting clarification for the L2 Testnet Tutorial was closed. The resolution confirms that the relevant documentation has been updated, addressing a blocker that multiple users had encountered since February.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Min Base Fee Tracking ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16807)):** Discussions continue around the "Min Base Fee" initiative. The conversation highlights significant cross-repository work, with references to active pull requests in `reth`, `op-alloy`, and the core `optimism` repository, indicating coordinated effort across the ecosystem.
    - **Congestion-Based Transaction Reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/306)):** This design discussion saw renewed interest, with a community member expressing a desire to collaborate. The issue explores tracking data availability (DA) usage over time and applying an exponential cost penalty, a concept that could be tested outside the protocol.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was most visible in the active issue discussions. The "Min Base Fee" issue ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16807)) serves as a central tracking point for a feature being implemented across multiple repositories, demonstrating strong coordination. Additionally, the design discussion for transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/306)) attracted external interest, showing community engagement in the project's long-term architectural decisions. Finally, the closure of an old documentation issue ([#1401](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1401)) reflects the team's responsiveness to community-reported developer experience hurdles.
