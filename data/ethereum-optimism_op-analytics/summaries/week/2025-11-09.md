# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on refreshing key analytical notebooks and advancing discussions on critical infrastructure updates. The primary development involved updating analyses for Orderly and Lyra with new data from the last 120 days, ensuring the accuracy of sampling results. Concurrently, important discussions progressed regarding future tooling and protocol compatibility, including a strategic shift away from the Kurtosis deployment tool and necessary script adaptations for the upcoming Dispute Game v2.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the project's analytical data.

### Analytical Notebook Updates
The `jovian_analysis.ipynb` notebook was updated to incorporate new results for Orderly and Lyra, covering both top percentile and random sampling methods over a 120-day period ([#1763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1763)). To address outdated outputs, the Orderly analysis was rerun, ensuring the latest data is correctly reflected in the notebooks and their associated image files ([#1764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1764)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed based on the available reports. However, several active issues saw significant discussion regarding future development and compatibility.

### New & Active Issues
- **Tooling Strategy:** A discussion in [#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16704) revealed a strategic shift for `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack`, as the Kurtosis deployment tool is being deprecated. This will impact the implementation of `sysext` support.
- **Kona Enhancements:** Progress was made on adding support for embedded custom prestates to Kona, with a fix currently under review to resolve issue [#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18271).
- **Dispute Game v2 Compatibility:** The `print_staging_report` script is being adapted for Dispute Game v2 compatibility ([#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1148)). The discussion highlights the need to modify the script to read game arguments from a new storage location and to handle the presence of multiple permissionless games, which may affect the JSON output format.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident through active discussions on key technical issues. The ongoing conversations around tooling deprecation ([#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16704)), Kona features ([#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18271)), and Dispute Game v2 upgrades ([#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1148)) demonstrate coordination among contributors to align on significant architectural and protocol-level changes.
