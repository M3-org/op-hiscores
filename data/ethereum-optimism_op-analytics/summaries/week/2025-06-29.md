# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Jun 29 - 5, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the data pipeline. Significant progress was made in resolving critical bugs affecting ETH transfers, including issues with null values and data type inconsistencies. The team also improved the robustness of economic data collection by implementing retry logic for collective balance retrieval and updating the fee split calculation process to use more direct RPC data. Internal tooling received key upgrades, particularly around Dagster automation, to streamline data processing and maintenance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on data integrity, economic modeling, and internal tooling enhancements.

- **ETH Transfer Data Integrity**
  - A critical bug was fixed to prevent ETH transfer entries with null `value_64` from being dropped, ensuring more complete data ([#1665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1665)).
  - Data type inconsistencies for ETH transfer data were corrected to improve accuracy in downstream analytics ([#1670](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1670)).

- **Economic Data & Revenue Logic**
  - The fee split calculation process was updated to include new entities (Uni, Sony) and now sources data directly from RPCs instead of Etherscan APIs for greater reliability ([#1664](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1664)).
  - To prevent data gaps, retry logic was added to the collective balances retrieval process, making it more resilient to transient null issues ([#1663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1663)).
  - Progress continued on unifying and configuring revenue share transfers for L2 transactions ([#1651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1651)).

- **Internal Tooling & Automation**
  - A new CLI-runnable function was introduced to automate Dagster version bumps, simplifying dependency management ([#1666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1666)).
  - The ability to run Dagster backfills was enabled for ETH transfers, improving the team's capacity to reprocess historical data ([#1667](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1667)).

- **Notebook & Utility Updates**
  - Minor modifications were made to various notebooks and utility files, including `google_bq_utils.py` and `l2beat_utils.py` ([#1669](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1669)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no active issues with significant discussion reported. However, a new pull request ([#1668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1668)) was opened to proactively address failing ERC20 token metadata, indicating ongoing work to resolve known data quality problems.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Based on the provided reports, development activity was focused and internally coordinated, with multiple pull requests targeting specific themes like data integrity and tooling. The reports do not contain specific details on cross-contributor discussions or community engagement on pull requests and issues.
