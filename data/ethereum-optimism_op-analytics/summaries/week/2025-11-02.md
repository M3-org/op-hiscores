# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on data maintenance and strategic planning for documentation. Key efforts involved updating chain metadata to ensure the accuracy of various analytical tools tracking OP Chains and Collective economics. An obsolete issue concerning unused test reporting was closed, reflecting an evolution in development practices. Additionally, ongoing discussions pointed towards consolidating documentation efforts for the DA Footprint Limit and MinBaseFee features, signaling a move towards more streamlined technical resources.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The primary technical work focused on maintaining the integrity of the project's data sources.

- **Chain Metadata Updates:** A pair of pull requests ([#1762](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1762), [#1761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1761)) updated core chain metadata files. These changes are crucial for maintaining accurate data feeds into helper functions, OP Chain tracking inputs and outputs, and analyses of OP Collective economics.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved cleaning up the backlog and planning future work.

- **Closed Issues:** An issue requesting a report for unused acceptance tests ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16273)) was closed. The task was deemed no longer relevant as the team has largely transitioned to using "gateless mode," making the original request obsolete.

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. Discussion continued on an active issue regarding documentation for the DA Footprint Limit ([#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1742)). A recent comment suggested that this work could be tracked alongside the broader documentation effort for the MinBaseFee feature, indicating a potential consolidation of related documentation tasks.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Based on the available data, collaboration was focused on planning and coordination. The discussion around issue [#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1742) highlights a collaborative effort to streamline and improve the efficiency of future documentation work by grouping related features.
