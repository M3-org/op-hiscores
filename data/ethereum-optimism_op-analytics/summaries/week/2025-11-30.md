# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Nov 30 - 6, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on advancing the project's analytics capabilities and solidifying the strategy for ZK fault proofs. The DEX query pipeline was enhanced to incorporate Solana data, improving cross-chain analytics. Significant progress was made in the ZK proof ecosystem, with a key decision made on proof generation and the closure of several issues related to `op-challenger` support for ZK games. However, an active `op-node` sync issue remains a blocking concern for some node operators on Base Mainnet.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, development focused on expanding data analytics.

- **Data Analytics Enhancements:** The Dex Trades Logic was updated to integrate Solana into the query pipeline. This change also refined data accuracy by tightening filtering criteria from `OR` to `AND`, ensuring more precise trade data ([#1770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1770)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving legacy items related to the challenger and addressing active blockers.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **ZK Proof Generation and Challenger Support:** A major step was taken with the decision to use the succinct proposer for generating ZK proofs, closing the investigation in issue [#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18319). Following this, support for challenging ZK game types in `op-challenger` was marked as complete ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18321)). A batch of older issues related to the challenger's bond management and test coverage were also closed, as the `op-challenger`'s new focus on ZK games has rendered them obsolete or already addressed ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18427), [#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18412), [#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18413), [#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18414), [#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18415)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened according to the provided reports.
    - A critical active issue is an `op-node` bug where it gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart, which is currently blocking some Base Mainnet node operators ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18468)).
    - Discussions are ongoing regarding the need for acceptance tests for new EIPs (EIP-7642 and EIP-7823) to ensure features are correctly disabled on OP chains ([#18221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18221)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active issue discussions. The `op-node` sync issue ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18468)), for example, saw confirmation from multiple users experiencing the same problem, highlighting a community effort to identify and diagnose critical bugs.
