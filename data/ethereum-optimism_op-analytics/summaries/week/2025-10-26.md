# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts focused on enhancing data infrastructure and resolving outstanding issues. Key progress was made on the data pipeline with critical fixes and the addition of new dashboard queries to improve reporting, including specific queries for Q3 2025 data. Several documentation and infrastructure issues were closed, notably fixing broken links and resolving a Flashblocks websocket timeout. Discussions continued around improving the `op-batcher`, with active collaboration with the Celestia team to upstream fixes related to data availability sizing.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the reliability and functionality of the project's data analytics and reporting systems.

- **Data Pipeline and Dashboard Enhancements:**
  Efforts were made to bolster the project's data infrastructure. This included implementing crucial pipeline fixes to ensure data integrity ([#1759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1759)). To improve reporting capabilities on the website dashboard, a new table generation query was added ([#1744](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1744)), along with a specific query to pull data for Q3 2025 ([#1760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1760)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on closing out documentation and infrastructure bugs, while discussions progressed on key active issues related to the `op-batcher`.

- **Closed Issues:**
  Several issues were resolved, improving documentation and system stability:
    - **Documentation:** Multiple issues concerning documentation content and broken internal tutorial links were fixed ([#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1797), [#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1802)). An issue related to a Q4 2024 audit page path was also closed ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1789)).
    - **Infrastructure:** The 30-second timeout issue on the Flashblocks websocket URL was investigated and resolved ([#17858](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17858)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  No new issues were opened this week. Discussions on active issues centered on the `op-batcher`'s interaction with alternative data availability (altDA) layers:
    - A conversation is ongoing regarding the `op-batcher`'s max frame size and its exemption from the altDA size limit ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17796)).
    - Investigation continues into upstreaming a batcher data availability size fix from Celestia. The proposed fix was reviewed and approved, with a request for the Celestia team to open a pull request ([#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17872)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the ongoing discussions around `op-batcher` improvements. Contributor `sebastianst` played a key role in reviewing a proposed fix from the Celestia team for a data availability size issue ([#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/17872)) and coordinating the next steps, which involve the Celestia team opening a PR to upstream their changes. This highlights active cross-team collaboration to enhance interoperability within the Superchain ecosystem.
