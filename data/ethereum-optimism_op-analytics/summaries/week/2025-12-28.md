# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Dec 28 - 3, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This was a quiet week for the `op-analytics` project, with development activity focused on essential maintenance. The primary action involved dependency cleanup to improve the project's stability and ease of installation. This housekeeping effort resolved installation conflicts by removing an unused package, ensuring a smoother experience for developers and contributors.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the project's underlying configuration and maintainability.

### Dependency Management
- A minor but important maintenance task was completed to remove the 'sugar' dependency. This package was identified as a source of installation problems in other projects and was not actively used within `op-analytics`. Its removal from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` streamlines the dependency tree and prevents future conflicts ([#1778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1778)).
