# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Sep 21 - 27, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on infrastructure maintenance and strategic cleanup, ensuring the long-term stability of the project's tooling and CI/CD pipelines. Key activities included proactively updating Helm chart configurations to address a dependency's upcoming sunset and fixing a bug in the weekly CI job. The team also closed several issues, notably confirming the successful enablement of flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers and officially deprecating the use of Kurtosis for test environments. Overall, it was a week focused on reinforcing the project's technical foundation rather than developing new features.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week was concentrated on maintaining the health and reliability of the project's infrastructure.

- **CI/CD and Helm Chart Maintenance:**
  - A bug affecting the weekly CI/CD job was resolved, restoring stability to the automated pipeline ([#1749](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1749)).
  - In response to an upcoming dependency change, the Dagster Helm chart values were updated to address a sunsetting requirement for Bitnami images ([#1748](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1748)). This proactive measure prevents future disruptions to the analytics stack.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on resolving outstanding items and addressing new infrastructure requirements.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Strategic Tooling Decisions:** An issue to add `op-test-sequencer` to Kurtosis was closed, as the team has decided to move away from using Kurtosis for its test environments ([#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15265)).
  - **Deployment Confirmation:** The issue tracking the enablement of flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers was closed, marking the successful completion of this deployment ([#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/16761)).
  - **Upstream Fixes:** A bug where `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` used default configurations was resolved. The issue was closed after an upstream fix in Go-Ethereum addressed the root cause ([#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/685)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - A new issue was opened to track the upcoming unavailability of Bitnami images used by the Dagster Helm chart ([#1747](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/1747)). This issue prompted the proactive maintenance work seen in PR [#1748](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1748).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
While there were no major collaborative threads on new features, the issue history reveals effective internal coordination and reliance on the broader ecosystem. The decision to deprecate Kurtosis ([#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/15265)) involved discussion among several team members before a final decision was made. Furthermore, the resolution of the `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` issue ([#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/685)) highlights the project's integration with and benefit from developments in upstream dependencies like Go-Ethereum.
