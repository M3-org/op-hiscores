      "repository": "ethereum-optimism/docs",
      "body": "Hi,\nWhile exploring the wonderful optimism doc website, I noticed that some internal links are broken. \n\nFor instance at:\nPath: /chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup/\nUrl: https://docs.optimism.io/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup/create-l2-rollup#manual-tutorial-overview\n\nThe links in this section are pointing to `https://docs.optimism.io/operators/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup/*`(leading 404 errors) while the tutorial pages stages are available at `https://docs.optimism.io/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup/*`\n\nI guess it's a redirection/migration problem that could solved here:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/optimism/docs/blob/16e50b51f8e7a8c040ad4dd6cffe6c0ca2576bbe/public/_redirects\nI tried fix it by myself following the contribution guide, but I was unable to reproduce the problem on local dev env, maybe I missed smtg...\n\nThanks for your attention 😊\n",
