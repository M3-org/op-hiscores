These are reviewed periodically to decide if they can be moved to a more active status.\n- `p-low`: (Nice to do) Tasks that have minimal impact on core operations and no immediate deadlines. These tasks are often more about quality of life improvements rather than essential needs.\n- `p-medium`: (Could do) Tasks that need to be done but are less critical than high-priority tasks. These often improve processes or efficiency but can be postponed if necessary without immediate severe repercussions.\n- `p-high`: (Should do) Important tasks that contribute significantly to long-term goals but may not have an immediate deadline. Delaying these tasks could have considerable negative effects but are not as immediate as critical tasks.\n- `p-critical`: Tasks that have immediate deadlines or significant consequences if not completed on time.
