      "body": "Hi,\nWhile exploring the wonderful optimism doc website, I noticed that some internal links are broken. \n\nFor instance at:\nPath: /chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup/\nUrl: https://docs.optimism.io/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup/create-l2-rollup#manual-tutorial-overview\n\nThe links in this section are pointing to `https://docs.optimism.io/operators/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup/*`(leading 404 errors) while the tutorial pages stages are available at `https://docs.optimism.io/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup/*`\n\nI guess it's a redirection/migration problem that could solved here:\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/optimism/docs/blob/16e50b51f8e7a8c040ad4dd6cffe6c0ca2576bbe/public/_redirects\nI tried fix it by myself following the contribution guide, but I was unable to reproduce the problem on local dev env, maybe I missed smtg...\n\nThanks for your attention 😊\n",

These are reviewed periodically to decide if they can be moved to a more active status.\n- `p-low`: (Nice to do) Tasks that have minimal impact on core operations and no immediate deadlines. These tasks are often more about quality of life improvements rather than essential needs.\n- `p-medium`: (Could do) Tasks that need to be done but are less critical than high-priority tasks. These often improve processes or efficiency but can be postponed if necessary without immediate severe repercussions.\n- `p-high`: (Should do) Important tasks that contribute significantly to long-term goals but may not have an immediate deadline. Delaying these tasks could have considerable negative effects but are not as immediate as critical tasks.\n- `p-critical`: Tasks that have immediate deadlines or significant consequences if not completed on time.
