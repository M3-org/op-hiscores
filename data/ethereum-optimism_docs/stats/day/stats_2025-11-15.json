      "number": 1871,
      "body": "This PR adds a short note to the README clarifying the distinction between\r\nUX-level finality on L2 and economic finality on L1.\r\n\r\nWhile transactions can be treated as final for user experience once they are\r\nincluded in an L2 block, economic finality is only achieved after the\r\ncorresponding state root has been posted and finalized on L1.\r\n\r\nThis helps developers set correct expectations when building on Optimism.\r\nDocumentation-only change, no code modifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nContributions welcome! See https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of the features you're adding in this pull request.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease describe any tests you've added.
