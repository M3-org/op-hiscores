## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Investigation into `op-node` Sequencer Recover Mode Behavior
Discussions continued on a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recover mode, specifically when it's enabled during normal operation. The core issue appears to be the sequencer requesting an L1 origin block that doesn't yet exist, leading to "not found" errors and a stalled L1 origin advancement, which violates the sequencer drift rule. A possible fix snippet was proposed to prevent temporary errors when recover mode catches up to the tip. Further investigation is ongoing to understand why temporary errors persist and if recent changes in async L1 origin fetching might be contributing.
