## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kurtosis Devnet Deprioritization
Several issues related to the Kurtosis devnet were closed with the rationale "Won't implement, closing" or "not currently a priority," indicating a shift away from active development in this area. These include adding genesis checks, improving idempotency and performance, extracting L1 chain config, creating tests for proxyd, adding a rotatory welcome message, and investigating selective service selection.

### Flashblocks Delivery Threat Modeling
An issue concerning infra threat modeling related to flashblocks delivery was closed. The discussion concluded that while the process for building and delivering flashblocks container images needs improvement for reliability and security, it doesn't introduce novel risks beyond what's already accepted for other images. The best short-term mitigation is to hardcode image digests in Kubernetes deployment manifests.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis Idempotency / Performance [#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/14390)
This issue, focused on improving Kurtosis devnet performance, was closed by alfonso-op, stating it's "Largely (if not fully) completed" and that Kurtosis is "not currently a priority." Earlier discussions highlighted significant improvements in deployment times, with fresh deployments taking around 4 minutes and incremental "noop" deployments taking 30 seconds on an M3 Max MBP. There was also a suggestion to track a separate issue for faster failure detection in case of Kurtosis API mismatches. The conversation also touched upon optimizing prestate and contract bundle build times, with ajsutton noting that local devnets don't always need the reproducible build process for prestates, which can be much faster.

### Implement Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17194)
This issue was initially closed by alfonso-op with "Won't implement, closing." However, ajsutton reopened it, pointing out a remaining TODO in the code that references this feature. The latest comment from alfonso-op requests the removal of the TODO in the code before closing the issue again, confirming that the feature will not be implemented.
