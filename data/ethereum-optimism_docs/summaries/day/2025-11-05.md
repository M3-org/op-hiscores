## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher: stay in sync with op-node rollup config
The discussion on [#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18178) revolves around the `op-batcher`'s current behavior of fetching the rollup config only once at startup from the `op-node` via RPC. Joshklop noted that making the endpoint provider control the batcher could introduce unnecessary concurrency and suggested that the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher. Sebastianst highlighted the brittleness of relying on error handling for outdated rollup configs and proposed an alternative where the active endpoint provider signals changes, triggering a reload of the rollup config.
