## CLOSED ISSUES

### Internal Process and System Refinements
Several issues related to internal system processes and logging were closed. This includes the closure of [#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17007) concerning `op-up` logging cleanup, which was deemed not worthwhile without `op-geth` eliminating global logger use. Additionally, [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16874) regarding `op-service` event call graph was closed as a similar solution exists and the team is moving towards removing the event system.
