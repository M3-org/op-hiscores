### Addressing `op-dispute-mon` Out-of-Sync Node Behavior
Discussions continued on [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17814) regarding `op-dispute-mon` incorrectly detecting disagreements when one of multiple configured rollup RPCs is behind. The latest comment from ajsutton on 2025-10-12T20:33:19Z suggests that simply trusting the highest L2 block might be problematic if it's from an incorrect fork. Instead, the focus should be on checking the `CurrentL1` from the sync status to determine if a node has processed the relevant L1 block for the dispute game. If the L1 block has been processed, the node is considered sufficiently in sync; otherwise, it's behind and its results may be invalid. This builds on a previous suggestion by pauldowman to use `syncStatus` to identify the highest unsafe block across all nodes as the expected current L2 head, ignoring results from nodes that are behind.
