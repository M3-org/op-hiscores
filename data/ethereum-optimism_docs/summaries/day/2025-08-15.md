### Data Availability Footprint Limit Discussions
Discussions continued on the Data Availability Footprint Limit, with updates provided on the design document and specification. The design document is available at [#17009](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17009) and the specification at [#17087](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17087).

### Event Call Graph Development
Discussion on [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16874) regarding an "Event Call Graph" noted that while a PR was submitted, the team is leaning towards removing the entire event system, making the proposed changes unlikely to be merged. The code may still be used to follow control flow during the event system removal.

### Go 1.24 Support in Cannon
Issue [#14760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/14760) was reopened to track the progress of supporting Go 1.24 in Cannon, with a sub-issue to be added for OPCM changes.
