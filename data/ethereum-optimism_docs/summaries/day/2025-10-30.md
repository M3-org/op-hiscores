## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Transaction Gas Limit for `op-deployer`**: Discussion on [#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17912) confirmed that the "transaction gas limit too high" error is due to the Fusaka hardfork enforcing a transaction gas limit cap of 16,777,216 (EIP-7825). The suggested solution is to break down large transactions or optimize them to be under this limit. It was also noted that the user is on an older `op-deployer` version, and a newer `v0.5.0*` release candidate is available, though its post-Fusaka behavior is yet to be fully tested.
- **L1 Chain Config for L3s**: On [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18070), the discussion revolved around the necessity of providing `op-node` and `op-program` with L1 chain configurations for L3s. A key suggestion was to automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID and apply L3 behavior, similar to how Mainnet and Sepolia are recognized, to simplify the process for most L3s.
- **Running Acceptance Tests Without Monorepo**: In [#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/469), a comment highlighted that modifying devnets with options often doesn't work because orchestrator fields are private, adding to the challenges of running acceptance tests outside the monorepo.
