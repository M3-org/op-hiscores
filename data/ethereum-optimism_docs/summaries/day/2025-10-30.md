## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Transaction Gas Limit for `op-deployer`**: Discussion on [#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17912) clarified that the "transaction gas limit too high" error is due to the Fusaka hardfork (EIP-7825) enforcing a 16,777,216 gas limit. The suggested solution is to break down large transactions or optimize them. It was also noted that the user is on an older `op-deployer` version, and testing with `v0.5.0*` (a release candidate) is recommended, though it might still encounter the same issue.
- **L1 Chain Config for L3s**: On [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18070), the conversation revolved around the necessity of providing L1 chain configuration for `op-node` and `op-program` for L3s. A key suggestion was to automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID to simplify the process for most L3s, similar to how Mainnet and Sepolia are recognized.
- **Running Acceptance Tests Without Monorepo**: The discussion on [#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/469) highlighted challenges in running acceptance tests outside the monorepo, specifically regarding contract artifacts and the limitations of modifying devnets due to private orchestrator fields.
