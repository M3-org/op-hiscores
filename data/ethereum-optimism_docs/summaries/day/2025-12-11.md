### Node Synchronization Problems and Potential Client Issues
Discussion on [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581) indicates multiple users are experiencing issues with node synchronization, specifically "missing trie node ... is not available" and "Failed to build payload" errors. These errors suggest that the L1 Execution Client (e.g., Geth or Erigon) might not be providing the necessary state data to the Op-Node for L2 block creation. Users reported similar problems across Base, Optimism, and Unichain, often when attempting to sync with snapshots. One user noted that `snapsync` with `--syncmode=execution-layer` worked for a new Unichain node, suggesting a potential workaround or configuration issue. There's speculation that a client update might be needed, and a request for more information on client configurations, full logs, and startup flags has been made to aid in diagnosis.
