# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Nov 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on documentation updates, including new tutorials for `op-geth` and versioning adjustments for notices. Two issues related to `op-program` hints and Kona compatibility were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Updates for Notices and Releases
*   Updated Rust stack releases and general versioning within notices. ([#1868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1868), [#1867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1867))

### New Operator Tutorial

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#1869](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1869) Update Actions SDK Config doc

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-program` Hint for Fast Block Header Oracle Lookup
*   The issue regarding adding a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program` has been closed. A hint was added to `op-program`, and while not currently used due to reliance on `op-geth`'s `debug_dbGet`, `kona-client`'s different lookup logic now outputs a relevant hint. ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17416))

### Kona Compatibility with Websockets
*   The issue concerning Kona's compatibility with websockets URLs in acceptance tests has been resolved. Kona has been updated to address this compatibility. ([#18203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18203))
