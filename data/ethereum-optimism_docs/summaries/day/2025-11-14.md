# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Nov 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's focus was on documentation updates, including new tutorials for `op-geth` and version updates for notices.
## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Updates for Chain Operators
A new tutorial was added to guide users on how to rewind `op-geth`, enhancing the resources available for chain operators [#1866](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1866).

### Notices and Release Versioning
Updates were made to the `fusaka-notice.mdx` and `upgrade-17.mdx` files, including an update to rust stack releases and general versioning information [#1868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1868), [#1867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1867).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-program` Hint for Fast Block Header Oracle Lookup
Issue [#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17416) was closed as a hint has been added to `op-program` for fast block header oracle lookup. The hint is not currently used as `op-geth` still handles the data lookup, but `kona-client` has different lookup logic that utilizes such hints.

### Kona Compatibility with Websockets URL
Issue [#18203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18203) was closed after Kona was updated to support websockets for connections to the L2 EL, resolving a compatibility issue with `sys go` which only provides websocket URLs.
