## CLOSED ISSUES

### Supervisor and Node Reset Improvements
An issue concerning the `op-supervisor` and `op-node`'s ability to improve reset unsafe targets was closed. The discussion highlighted that significant progress had been made in related PRs, and given recent project changes, the issue was no longer considered actionable. ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16314))

### Enhanced Logging Utility
An issue related to creating a more reusable logger utility for changing log levels of sub-loggers was closed. The resolution indicated that the desired functionality for adjusting log levels based on context data is already supported via `op-service` and its log handler methods.
