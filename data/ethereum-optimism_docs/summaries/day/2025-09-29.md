## CLOSED ISSUES

**Flashblocks RPC Deployment and Testing**
- The issue of deploying a flashblocks-rpc node was resolved with the successful spin-up of an instance identified as `op-opn-reth-f-fb-0` ([#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16764)).
- Load tests for the rollup-boost flashblocks forwarder were completed, and their results were documented in an augmented Notion page ([#17462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17462)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

**L2CL<>L2EL Synchronization Conditions**
Discussions continued on [#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17628) regarding the conditions for L2EL to start syncing. The latest comments from @pcw109550, @ajsutton, and @sebastianst indicate a general agreement that the EL client should primarily focus on syncing itself to the new chain head, regardless of the specific sync mechanism (e.g., snap-sync). The ticket may be closed as the focus shifts to handling EL Syncs after the initial run, potentially addressed by `engineController.insertUnsafePayload`.
