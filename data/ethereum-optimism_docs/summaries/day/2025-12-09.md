# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Dec 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant documentation enhancements, including splitting JSON-RPC references, updating network design examples, and porting `op-deployer` documentation. Several issues related to devnet deployment and JSON-RPC APIs were also resolved.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Node Operator Documentation
*   JSON-RPC documentation was split into separate sections for `op-geth` and `op-node`, improving clarity and organization for node operators ([#1905](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1905)).
*   The network design example was updated with detailed configurations for sequencers and Tx Ingress Nodes, providing more comprehensive guidance for chain operators ([#1913](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1913)).

### Streamlined Devnet and Deployment Processes
*   P2P functionality is now disabled by default in the `create-l2-rollup-example` devnet setup, addressing previous warnings and simplifying local development environments ([#1906](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1906)).
*   The `op-deployer` documentation was ported from the monorepo, providing a centralized and updated resource for deployment tools ([#1911](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1911)).

### Documentation Infrastructure Refinements
*   General refactoring of documentation files and the removal of old GitHub templates and CODEOWNERS files were completed to streamline the repository and improve maintainability ([#1909](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1909), [#1912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1912)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#1915](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1915) feat: changes to launch op stack
*   [#1914](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1914) docs: add Custom Gas Token v2 documentation

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Devnet and Node Configuration Issues Resolved
*   An issue regarding warnings in `op-node` when deploying a devnet using `create-l2-rollup-example` was closed, with the explanation that these warnings are not problematic for local devnets ([#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1898)).
*   The issue concerning the absence of ENV variables in `op-node` and `op-geth` documentation was fixed ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1874)).

### Documentation Updates Completed
*   The task to update the `op-deployer` documentation was completed, ensuring the latest contract and `op-deployer` versions are reflected ([#1769](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1769)).
*   The JSON-RPC API documentation was updated and split into `op-node` and `op-geth` specific pages, addressing the need for clearer reference material ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1773)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node Synchronization Challenges
*   Issue [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18510) reports that `op-node` v1.16.3 is failing to synchronize after an upgrade from v1.16.2 for Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments. The latest comment confirms that upgrading and resyncing `op-geth` resolved the synchronization issue. Previously, it was suggested that the log line indicating synchronization issues is not uncommon after an `op-node` restart, and an upgrade to `op-geth` v1.101603.5 was recommended.
