# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Dec 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing documentation for node operators and developers, including new features for devnet configuration and JSON-RPC splitting, alongside significant refactoring and the porting of `op-deployer` documentation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Node Operator Documentation & Configuration
- Disabled P2P by default in devnet examples to streamline local development setups ([#1906](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1906)).
- Split JSON-RPC documentation into separate sections for `op-geth` and `op-node` for improved clarity and reference ([#1905](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1905)).
- Updated network design examples with detailed sequencer and transaction ingress node configurations, including new diagrams ([#1913](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1913)).

### Documentation Infrastructure and Content Expansion
- Performed a significant refactoring of various documentation files, including style guides, contributing guidelines, and developer guides, to improve consistency and maintainability ([#1909](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1909)).
- Ported `op-deployer` documentation from the monorepo to the docs website, providing comprehensive guides on installation, usage, and architecture for chain operators ([#1911](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1911)).
- Simplified GitHub repository management by removing old issue templates and CODEOWNERS files ([#1912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1912)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#1915](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1915) feat: changes to launch op stack
- [#1914](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1914) docs: add Custom Gas Token v2 documentation

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Node Operator Documentation Improvements
- The JSON-RPC API documentation was updated and split into `op-node` and `op-geth` specific pages, addressing the need for clearer reference material ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1773)).
- Documentation regarding environment variables for `op-node` and `op-geth` flags was restored, resolving a previous omission ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1874)).

### Devnet and Deployment Documentation Updates
- The `op-deployer` documentation was updated and ported to the main docs site, fulfilling the need for current and comprehensive deployment guides ([#1769](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1769)).
- Warnings observed in `op-node` when deploying a devnet using `create-l2-rollup-example` were clarified as non-problematic for local devnets, stemming from P2P network gossip attempts ([#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1898)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node Synchronization Issues
- Issue [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18510) reports synchronization problems with `op-node` after upgrading to v1.16.3 for Optimism, Base, and Worldchain.
- The user J1a-wei confirmed that upgrading and resyncing `op-geth` resolved the synchronization issue.
- geoknee previously suggested that the log line indicating synchronization issues is not uncommon after an `op-node` restart and recommended upgrading `op-geth` to v1.101603.5.
- The user J1a-wei provided details on the `op-geth` and `op-node` versions being used.
