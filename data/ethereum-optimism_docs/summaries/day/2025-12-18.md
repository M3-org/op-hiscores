# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on minor fixes within the documentation, specifically addressing issues in chain and node operator guides. Discussions on interop transaction evaluation and op-challenger trace output continued, highlighting ongoing efforts in protocol refinement and testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Refinements for Operators
Minor fixes were implemented across various operator guides to improve clarity and accuracy. This included updates to snap-sync documentation and best practices for chain operators. ([#1925](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1925))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kona Interop Test Re-enablement
The Kona interop action tests have been re-enabled, addressing a previous disablement. While now active, these tests do not yet block CI, a change planned for Kona's migration to the Optimism monorepo. ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18613))

## NEW ISSUES

### Op-Challenger Trace Output Review
A new issue was opened to review the correct trace output in `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found. This involves examining the behavior of the super root provider and its handling of intermediate steps between super roots, particularly when the next one is unavailable. ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18643))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574))
Discussions continued regarding the necessity of an additional transaction for replacement blocks in the interop protocol. The latest comments indicate a consensus towards simplifying the spec by removing the additional transaction, especially considering its reduced value in a ZK dispute system where derivation is re-run during proof generation. The supernode's ability to generate necessary data for proofs without an extra deposit transaction was highlighted, suggesting a path to protocol simplification. The architectural refactoring and specification updates are now the next steps.

### Op-Challenger: Review Correct Trace Output When Next Super Root Is Not Found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18643))
The discussion on this newly opened issue quickly identified a potential problem with the `op-program` transitioning to an invalid hash on the first chain with insufficient data. There's a question about the correctness of the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test and how the `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC behaves when chains are not supported by L1, even if local-safe. The supervisor's logic for returning super roots for blocks that are not cross-safe but are local-safe was also brought into question.
