# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on minor fixes within the documentation, specifically addressing issues in chain and node operator guides. Discussions on interop transaction evaluation and op-challenger trace output continued, highlighting ongoing efforts in protocol refinement and testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Refinements for Operators
Minor fixes were implemented across various operator guides, enhancing clarity and accuracy for chain and node operators. This included updates to snap-sync and best practices documentation. ([#1925](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1925))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- None

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interop Test Re-enablement
The Kona interop action tests were re-enabled, ensuring their functionality. However, it was noted that Kona CI does not currently block on these tests, with plans to integrate them as a blocker once Kona is migrated to the Optimism monorepo. ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18613))

## NEW ISSUES

### Op-Challenger Trace Output Review
A new issue was opened to review the correct trace output in `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found. This involves examining the behavior of the super root provider and its handling of intermediate steps between super roots, particularly when the next super root is unavailable. ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18643))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop Transaction Evaluation and Rework
Discussions continued regarding the evaluation and potential rework of injected replacement transactions in interop. The latest comments indicate a consensus towards simplifying the protocol by removing the additional deposit transaction for proofs, as it provides no value in a ZK dispute system. It was noted that the Supernode should be capable of generating necessary data for proofs without an extra deposit transaction. The architectural refactoring and specification updates are now prioritized. ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574))
