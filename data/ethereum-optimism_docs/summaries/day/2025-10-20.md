## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened today:
- A new feature, "Feature/monitoring guide" ([#1796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1796)), was initiated.
- A pull request titled "U17 notice" ([#1795](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1795)) was also opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES

No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES

### Developer Tooling Improvements
- A new issue was opened to "Improve `op-up` so it can serve as a sysgo runner during development" ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17942)). This aims to adapt `op-up` as a replacement for Kurtosis for local devnet spin-up.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Implementation
Discussion on "[DA Footprint Limit] Complete implementation" ([#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17551)) indicates that the implementation is currently blocked by a spec derivation issue in the `optimism` repository.

### Rollup Configuration Changes
The issue "jovian: do not marshal new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active" ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17907)) continues to be discussed. The latest comments revolve around whether to update `op-succinct/kailua` directly or to justify the change on the grounds of not updating APIs in an uncoordinated way.

### Local Development Environment
A new issue, "Improve `op-up` so it can serve as a sysgo runner during development" ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17942)), was opened. The initial discussion questions whether a CLI tool is strictly necessary for local devnet spin-up, suggesting that long-running acceptance tests might already provide a simple alternative.
