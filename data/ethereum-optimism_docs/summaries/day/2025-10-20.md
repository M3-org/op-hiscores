## NEW ISSUES

### Developer Tooling Improvements
- A new issue was opened to "Improve `op-up` so it can serve as a sysgo runner during development" ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17942)). This aims to adapt `op-up` as a replacement for Kurtosis for local devnet spin-up.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Implementation
Discussion on "[DA Footprint Limit] Complete implementation" ([#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17551)) indicates that progress is currently blocked by a spec derivation issue in the `optimism` repository ([#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17946)).

### Rollup Configuration Compatibility
The issue "jovian: do not marshal new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active" ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17907)) continues to be discussed. The latest comments revolve around whether to update `op-succinct/kailua` directly or to implement a nullable system config to avoid breaking zk stacks. There's also a consideration about justifying such changes on the grounds of coordinated API updates.
