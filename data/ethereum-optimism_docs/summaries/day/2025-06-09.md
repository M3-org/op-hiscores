# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Jun 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on documentation refinement, with minor fixes to existing content and navigation updates. A significant issue regarding an outdated L2 rollup testnet guide was closed, and discussions continued on CI flakiness and supervisor L1 origin handling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Typos and Structure
Minor typographical errors were corrected in the documentation, specifically in `pages/notices/upgrade-15.mdx` and `pages/notices/superchain-withdrawal-pause-test.mdx` ([#1652](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1652), [#1653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1653)). Additionally, navigation titles were updated in `pages/stack/smart-contracts/_meta.json` to address a broken smart contracts navigation link ([#1638](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1638)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Outdated Documentation Closure
An issue concerning an outdated L2 rollup testnet guide was closed ([#1614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1614)). The guide referenced a deprecated L2OutputOracleProxy contract, and the issue was closed as the team tracks these updates internally.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI Flakiness Investigation
Discussions continued on investigating and improving CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16271)). The latest comments highlight that most flakiness is due to infrastructure issues (e.g., CircleCI machine issues, networking) rather than acceptance testing. A list of the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests was provided, with `TestSequencingWindowExpiry` and `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` being the most frequent.

### Supervisor L1 Origin Validity
The issue regarding improving L1 origin validity handling during supervisor resets saw further discussion ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16315)). The latest comments suggest that the supervisor should ensure all provided targets are valid, rather than the op-node performing complex walkbacks or duplicate validity checks. It was noted that a L1 origin verifier method now exists at the supervisor side for local unsafe heads, and there's a proposal to extend this to safe heads.

### Incorrect Nonce from eth_getTransactionCount
The issue concerning `eth_getTransactionCount` returning an incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending transactions on the Base node remains active ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/623)). Users are still awaiting an update on this problem, which causes transactions to get stuck in the mempool.

### Superchain Interop Environment Quickstart Guide
Discussions are ongoing for a quickstart guide for the Superchain Interop environment ([#1644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1644)). The team is considering this content for a potential homepage and is exploring a wider lens for its scope. A draft is expected by tomorrow.

### Complete Withdrawal Flow Test
Progress was reported on the complete withdrawal flow test ([#327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/327)). An implementation using `op-devstack` has been completed, with two follow-up tickets identified: adding support for `kt (sysext)` and executing a withdrawal without proving it (devnet).
