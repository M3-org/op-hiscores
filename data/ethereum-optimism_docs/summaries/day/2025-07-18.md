# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Jul 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on documentation consistency, with a significant update to explorer links across various sections. Additionally, progress was made on resolving interop acceptance test failures and aligning test topologies with production environments.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Standardization
A major effort was undertaken to standardize explorer URLs throughout the documentation, ensuring consistency and preventing broken links across numerous pages related to app development, Superchain, and the OP Stack. This enhancement improves the overall user experience and reliability of the documentation. ([#1693](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1693))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interop Acceptance Test Resolution
An issue related to failing interop acceptance tests due to an `op-geth` version bump was closed, with a solution identified in a related pull request. ([#16731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16731))

### Interop Test Functionality
The issue concerning the basic functionality of an interop network in acceptance tests was closed, with the responsibility for its resolution transferred to the Protocol team. ([#298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/298))

## NEW ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Topology Alignment
A new issue was opened to address the discrepancy between the current local Kurtosis interop devnet topology and the production environment, aiming to match the acceptance test topology to real-world conditions. ([#16746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16746))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Topology Alignment ([#16746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16746))
The discussion highlights that the current Kurtosis interop devnet exposes the sequencer publicly, which differs from production. This issue stems from a missing flag in the `op-geth` sequencer used by acceptance tests, causing test failures. The focus is on making the Kurtosisnet YAML description match the production environment, including adding `proxyd` and `verifier` nodes.
