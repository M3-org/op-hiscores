## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-acceptance-tests: sysgo to support flashblocks / rbuilders ([#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16450))
The discussion on this issue revolves around the current limitation of `sysgo` not being aware of flashblocks/rbuilders, which prevents flashblocks-related tests from running with the `sysgo` orchestrator. The latest comment from @geoknee asks @teddyknox for an update on whether this task is completed.

### create a new op-spammer component for deployment in devnets ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18482))
This issue proposes creating a simple service for devnets that can be configured with a private key and Ethereum RPC endpoint to periodically send user transactions. The goal is to catch bugs on devnets more effectively. The latest comments suggest exploring existing solutions like Flashbots' Contender, with @geoknee pointing to it as potential prior art and @scharissis specifically highlighting an issue within Contender.

### Update op-node v1.16.3. EL node can’t synchronize ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18510))
This issue reports that after upgrading `op-node` from v1.16.2 to v1.16.3, Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments are unable to synchronize. The logs show a consistent issue across all three. @J1a-wei provided details on the `op-geth` and `op-node` versions being used. @geoknee requested more detailed logs/metrics, specifically regarding safe and unsafe heads, and advised upgrading `op-geth` to v1.101603.5, noting that the reported log line is not uncommon after an `op-node` restart.
