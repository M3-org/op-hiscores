## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-acceptance-tests: sysgo to support flashblocks / rbuilders
Discussion continues on issue [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16450) regarding sysgo's lack of awareness for flashblocks/rbuilders, which prevents flashblocks-related tests from running. The latest comment from @geoknee asks for an update on whether this task is complete, following an earlier comment from @teddyknox indicating a desire to implement this to validate a `kona-node + rollup-boost` change.

### create a new op-spammer component for deployment in devnets
Issue [#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18482) discusses the creation of a new `op-spammer` component for devnet deployments to catch bugs. The latest comment from @geoknee suggests that existing prior art, specifically `https://github.com/flashbots/contender`, might be sufficient.

### Update op-node v1.16.3. EL node can’t synchronize
Issue [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18510) reports synchronization problems after upgrading `op-node` to v1.16.3 for Optimism, Base, and Worldchain. The latest comment from @J1a-wei provides the specific `op-geth` and `op-node` docker image versions being used.
