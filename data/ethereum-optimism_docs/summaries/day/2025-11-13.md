## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Report Script
Discussion continues on updating the `print_staging_report` script to be compatible with dispute-game v2. The latest comments clarify that the script primarily reads from the permissioned game and that changes to the JSON output format might cause disruption. The script's current assumption of only two games (Permissioned and Permissionless) will need to be addressed as there will be two permissionless games in the future.
