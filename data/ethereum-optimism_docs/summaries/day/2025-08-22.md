### Validation Test Refinement
Discussion on [#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/686) continues regarding adding validation tests for chain configurations. The latest comment from alfonso-op (2025-08-22T17:01:27Z) indicates a planned discussion with @bitwiseguy and Tess to review "not planned" validation tests and determine if any should still be implemented. This follows an earlier action item for @bitwiseguy to create sub-issues for different validation tests (2024-12-11T15:13:17Z). Previous comments from geoknee (2024-11-25T18:04:39Z) suggested moving complexity into pure functions for easier testing and increasing code coverage, highlighting the brittleness of TOML file parsing (2024-11-25T18:02:51Z).
