# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `create-l2-rollup-example` with a new feature for funding developer accounts and a critical bug fix related to sequencer HTTP settings. Several long-standing issues were closed, primarily concerning validation processes and Kurtosis investment, while new issues highlighted broken internal links in tutorials.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **L2 Rollup Example Enhancements**
    *   Added a feature to fund developer accounts within the `create-l2-rollup-example` setup script, streamlining the development process ([#1803](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1803)).
    *   Fixed a bug in the `create-l2-rollup-example`'s `docker-compose.yml` to prevent setting `rollup.sequencerhttp`, addressing an issue referenced in an external HTTP link ([#1804](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1804)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   A new pull request, [#1805](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1805), was opened to add missing redirects to the documentation.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Validation Process Streamlining**
    *   Closed issues related to validating all chains on PRs and running genesis validation checks for frontier chains, as the project has moved to a report-based approach rather than blocking validations ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/689), [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/696)).
*   **Jovian Upgrade Finalization**
    *   The issue concerning the update of Jovian upgrade transactions' bytecode was closed, following the finalization of specs and `op-node` updates ([#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/772)).
    *   The issue tracking the update of the Jovian `daFootprintGasScalar` default value was closed, with the value settled at 400 ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/773)).
*   **Kurtosis Investment and Devnet Funding**
    *   Closed the issue regarding the ability to use local `op-geth` builds with Kurtosis, as investment in Kurtosis is no longer a priority ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16975)).
    *   The issue for adding a Sepolia ETH faucet to the Protocol R&D Discord was closed, as the team is moving away from Discord for this purpose and account funding is now in-scope for devnet efforts ([#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/12952)).

## NEW ISSUES

*   **Documentation Link Integrity**
    *   An issue was reported concerning broken internal links within tutorials on the Optimism documentation website, specifically in the `/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup/` path ([#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1802)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **DA Footprint Limit Investigation** ([#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17946))
    *   The latest comment confirms that the issue has been identified: the first block's L1 block attributes were populated from the genesis SystemConfig, which could have a 0 scalar that was not translated. A fix has been implemented in PR #17947.
*   **Update OPCMStandardValidator to handle new dispute game contracts** ([#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17267))
    *   The issue was initially closed but then reopened because tests are still being skipped when V2 is enabled, indicating that the problem is not fully resolved despite previous work.
