# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `create-l2-rollup-example` with new features and bug fixes, alongside significant progress in closing several long-standing issues related to chain validation, Kurtosis, and Jovian upgrade specifications.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **L2 Rollup Example Enhancements**
    *   Added a feature to fund developer accounts within the `create-l2-rollup` example ([#1803](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1803)).
    *   Fixed an issue where `rollup.sequencerhttp` was incorrectly set for the example ([#1804](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1804)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   A new pull request, [#1805](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1805), was opened to add missing redirects to the documentation.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Deprecation of Kurtosis and Discord Faucet**
    *   The issue regarding the ability to use local `op-geth` builds with Kurtosis was closed as Kurtosis is no longer being actively invested in ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16975)).
    *   The request for a Sepolia ETH faucet in the Protocol R&D Discord was closed due to a shift away from Discord for such functionalities, with account funding now in-scope for devnet efforts ([#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/12952)).

*   **Jovian Upgrade Specification Finalization**
    *   The issue to update the Jovian upgrade transactions' bytecode was closed, with the specifications and `op-node` implementation finalized today ([#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/772)).
    *   The `daFootprintGasScalar` default value for Jovian was finalized and the issue closed, settling on 400 as a good tradeoff ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/773)).

*   **Chain Validation Process Improvements**
    *   The issue to validate all chains on PRs modifying validation test code was closed, as the project has moved to chain reports instead of blocking validations ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/689)).
    *   The issue to not run genesis validation checks for frontier chains was closed, also due to the adoption of a report-based approach over strict validations ([#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/696)).

*   **Dispute Game Contract Updates**
    *   The issue to rewire `interopgen` config was closed as "won't fix," noting that `interopgen` is only used by `op-e2e` and new tests are now acceptance tests, removing the need for further configuration ([#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17614)).

## NEW ISSUES

*   **Documentation Link Integrity**
    *   An issue was reported concerning broken internal links within tutorials on the Optimism documentation website, specifically citing the `/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup/` path ([#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1802)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Dispute Game Contract Updates**
    *   [#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17267) "Update OPCMStandardValidator to handle new dispute game contracts": The issue was initially closed but then reopened by ajsutton because tests are still skipped when V2 is enabled, indicating that the problem is not fully resolved despite related PRs.

*   **DA Footprint Limit Investigation**
    *   [#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17946) "[DA Footprint Limit] Investigate why block right after genesis still has 0 gas scalar": sebastianst confirmed that the issue has been found and fixed in [#17947](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17947). The problem was related to how the first block's L1 block attributes were populated from the genesis SystemConfig, which could have a 0 scalar that was not translated.
