## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-proposer` Transaction Failures
Discussions on [#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/13502) continued regarding `op-proposer` failing to create transactions. The latest comment from `dariusL3` (Aug 26, 2025) confirmed that setting `--game-type=1` fixed the issue for them, aligning with previous suggestions about upgrading the game factory address proxy and checking game types.

### Sync Testing Enhancements
On [#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16703), `pcw109550` (Aug 26, 2025) outlined test case ideas for sync testing, prioritizing checking all OP Stack Hard Fork transitions, not just Isthmus. Other ideas include testing with multiple CLs and user transactions, with items 2 and 3 being captured in a separate issue.

### Load Testing Flashblocks
Issue [#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16756) saw a brief update from `zhwrd` (Aug 26, 2025) clarifying that they are working on the report after accidentally moving the issue to "done." `alfonso-op` (Aug 26, 2025) requested a summary document of the load test outcomes.

### Flashblocks Sequencer Alerts
Discussions on [#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16867) regarding alerts for non-flashblocks-enabled sequencers saw `jelias2` (Aug 26, 2025) link to a relevant pull request, stating that the alert will be created once it lands. Similarly, for [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16868) concerning low peer count alerts for flashblocks-enabled sequencers, `jelias2` (Aug 26, 2025) noted existing peer count alerting for `op-node` and plans to add `reth`/`op-rbuilder` peer count for this specific alert.
