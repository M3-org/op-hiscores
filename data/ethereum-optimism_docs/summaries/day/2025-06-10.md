## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes
Discussions continue on the necessary changes to support OPCM updates for the Fault Proof creator contract ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15789)). The latest comment outlines a detailed checklist of tasks, including moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, and reviewing test updates. A related pull request in the `optimism` repository was also referenced.

### op-supervisor: Event Overflow on Large Unsafe Head Gap
The issue concerning the `op-supervisor` entering a crash-loop due to a large unsafe head gap is still active ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16335)). Recent comments discuss the nature of `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` and whether it contributes to the event overflow. While some believe these events do not stack up, others are working on adding counters per event type to better diagnose the issue if it recurs. A pull request to add a gauge for in-flight events has been created to help monitor this.
