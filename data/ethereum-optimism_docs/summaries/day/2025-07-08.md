### Clarification on Precompile Address Initialization
Discussion continued on [#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16620) regarding the initialization of addresses 0x00-0xff in the OP Stack. The latest comment from tynes clarified that these are precompile addresses and the 1 wei balance is normal due to rules concerning empty accounts, ensuring they are not treated as empty.
