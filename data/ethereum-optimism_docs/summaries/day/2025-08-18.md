# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Aug 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on critical documentation updates, including corrections to the Fault Proofs Explainer, an outdated chain-dev-net tutorial, and a precompile tutorial to ensure EIP-7587 compliance.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Accuracy and Updates
- Corrected misleading information in the Fault Proofs Explainer to accurately reflect the `op-challenger` tool ([#1706](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1706)).
- Updated the `chain-dev-net.mdx` tutorial, which was outdated and prevented new users from launching the devnet ([#1714](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1714)).

### Tutorial Enhancements for EIP-7587 Compliance
- Fixed a precompile address conflict in the "Adding a precompile" tutorial to ensure compliance with EIP-7587 ([#1715](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1715)).
