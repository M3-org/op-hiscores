## NEW ISSUES
### Documentation Site Display Issues
*   A new issue was reported concerning the theme-switcher button text visibility in light mode on the Optimism docs site, where the text is not displayed properly when the button is active ([#1752](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1752)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### L2EL Syncing Conditions
Discussions continued on the issue of determining the conditions under which L2EL can start syncing ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17628)). On September 27th, ajsutton commented that `op-geth` will still sync even if it has a finalized sync, and the primary concern is for the EL to reach the new chain head, regardless of the specific syncing mechanism. This suggests that the focus should be on the EL's ability to sync rather than the method it uses.
