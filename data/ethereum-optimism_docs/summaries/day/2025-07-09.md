## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fault Proof Creator Contract Changes
- **[#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15789) Fault Proof creator contract OPCM changes**: Discussions are ongoing regarding necessary OPCM changes to support recent updates. The latest comment outlines a detailed checklist of tasks, including moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, removing `anchorStateRegistry`, unskipping and updating tests, reviewing comments, addressing TODOs, and rebasing updates from EVM safety refactoring.

### Abnormal CPU Usage with op-geth
- **[#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/613) Abnormal CPU usage with latest op-geth (v1.101511.0)**: Users continue to report high CPU usage with `op-geth`. The latest comment confirms the issue and provides a `pprof` file, noting that the performance issue might be related to an index update that took about 24 hours to complete on an Orange Pi 5 Plus. Previous comments suggested that the high CPU usage could be temporary due to log indexing rebuilds or a persistent bug.

### RV Audit - TestCrossSafeUpdate
- **[#16548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16548) RV Audit - `TestCrossSafeUpdate` testing impossible cases ; No clear `invalid` signal during Hazard Set construction**: The discussion revolves around a specific test (`TestCrossSafeUpdate`) that appears to be testing impossible cases. The latest comment indicates a pull request has been made to address this.
