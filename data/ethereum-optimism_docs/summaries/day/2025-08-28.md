# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Aug 28, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day's focus was on enhancing documentation, particularly with a new tutorial for upgrading ERC-20 tokens for Superchain interoperability. Several issues related to documentation and audit processes were closed, indicating ongoing efforts to refine content and internal workflows.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Interoperability Documentation
A significant new tutorial was added to guide users on upgrading existing ERC-20 tokens for interoperability within the Superchain ecosystem. This involves detailed steps for contract upgrades, custom bridging, and lockbox mechanisms, crucial for seamless asset migration and utilization in the new interop environment. ([#1577](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1577))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-deployer Documentation Overhaul
Discussion continues on overhauling the documentation for creating an OP Stack Rollup testnet using `op-deployer` ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1530)). The latest comment from @krofax highlights a "rich PR" ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705/](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705/)) that aims to completely revise the existing "Create an op stack Rollup testnet with op-deployer" guide, inviting review from @opfocus. Earlier comments from April 2025 discussed high RPC call numbers on Alchemy when using the permissioned fault-proof system, particularly from the challenger, and discrepancies between old manual deployment methods and the new `op-deployer` approach, which defaults to FaultDisputeGame. There was also a question about potential issues when deploying a chain with permissioned fault proofs.

### Monorepo CI for op-geth PRs
The discussion around running the monorepo CI suite on `op-geth` PRs ([#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/665)) saw a new suggestion from @ajsutton. Option C proposes a periodic job in the monorepo to check for the latest `op-geth` commit from the Optimism branch, notifying via Slack if it fails. This approach aims to quickly alert to problems, though it might produce false alarms if it runs between `op-geth` and corresponding monorepo PR merges. The core problem is ensuring that `op-geth` changes are validated against the broader monorepo CI.
