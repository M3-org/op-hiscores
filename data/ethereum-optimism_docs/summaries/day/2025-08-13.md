### `op-challenger` Interoperability Testing Re-evaluation
Issue [#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15948), concerning `op-challenger` acceptance tests on interop chains, was re-opened on August 13th by mbaxter to address remaining TODOs. The issue aims to ensure `op-challenger` successfully disputes invalid proposals and, if possible, covers game resolution. Previous discussions highlighted the need to identify the `op-challenger`'s EOA for assertion purposes.

### `op-sync-tester` `eth` Namespace Support
Issue [#16700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16700), which tracks `op-sync-tester` support for the `eth` namespace, was re-opened on August 13th by pcw109550 to track test case implementation for the `eth` namespace. The issue outlines the need for `op-sync-tester` to serve `eth_getBlockReceipts`, `eth_getBlockByHash`, and `eth_getBlockByNumber` methods for blocks prior to the `test_head`.
