## NEW ISSUES
### Documentation for Node Operators
New issues were opened to enhance documentation for node operators, specifically to add an `op-reth` section to the execution configuration guide ([#1893](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1893)) and a subsection for running `op-reth` with historical proofs exex ([#1894](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1894)). The latter is dependent on the former. An issue was also raised regarding the `/node-operators/reference/consensus-layer-sync` path ([#1895](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1895)).

### Monthly Metrics Reports
Two issues were created to generate metrics reports for November 2025, covering closed issues ([#1891](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1891)) and opened pull requests ([#1892](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1892)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### ZK Game Challenging Strategy
The issue [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18322) regarding how to support challenging ZK games was closed today. The decision was made to proceed with `op-challenger` for this purpose.

### SuperchainConfig Type Porting
Discussion continued on [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/741) regarding porting the `SuperchainConfig` type from `superchain-registry`. A PR ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/867)) was opened by @Himess based on previous feedback from @emhane regarding the notation, ensuring it aligns with the expected format for specs rather than Go syntax.
