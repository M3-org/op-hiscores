## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Superchain Registry 2.0 Implementation**: Several issues related to the Superchain Registry were closed, indicating successful refactoring and updates. This includes modifications to the `add-chain` tool to allow chains to opt into hardforks ([#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/610)), resolution of an L2 key handover test issue ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/643)), and improvements to the `golang-validate-all` CI job for better pass/fail summaries ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/644)).

## NEW ISSUES
None.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **`op-node` Interop and Sync-Start Logic**: Discussions on [#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16141) and [#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16140) highlight the need for `op-node`'s sync-start algorithm to be aware of Interop activation and the removal of the anchor point RPC. These issues were reopened by ajsutton, noting that several TODOs still reference them, emphasizing the need for better tracking of such items outside of code comments.
*   **`op-supervisor` Multi-Node Support and Backward Compatibility**: Issue [#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16174) regarding dropping multi-node support in `op-supervisor` was reopened by ajsutton due to a remaining TODO. Similarly, [#16245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16245), concerning the removal of a backward compatibility fallback in `op-supervisor`, was reopened by ajsutton for the same reason.
*   **Event System Refactor Comments Cleanup**: Issue [#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16917) was reopened by ajsutton, indicating that comments related to the event system refactor still need to be cleaned up, with multiple TODOs referencing this issue.
*   **`op-devstack` Address Book Fix**: Issue [#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15817) was reopened by ajsutton, noting that the `sysext` address book needs to be updated to reflect changes in the local devnet description, with several TODOs still referencing this issue.
*   **`op-node` Initial EL Sync UX and Correctness**: Discussion on [#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17631) continues, with mslipper suggesting it be addressed after full deprecation of req/res sync. The issue concerns the `op-node` marking blocks as finalized after initial EL Sync, even if not truly finalized, and potential edge cases during `insertUnsafePayload`.
*   **`op-node` Safe Head Advancement and Unsafe Rewind during EL Sync**: Issues [#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18124) and [#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18125), both related to potential problems found during the deprecation of RR Sync, were punted by mslipper until the full deprecation of RR sync is decided.
*   **Fusaka-on-L2 Design Finalization**: Issue [#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/355) is awaiting finalization after checking with customers, as noted by mslipper.
