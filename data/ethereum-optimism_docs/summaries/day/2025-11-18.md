## OVERVIEW 
The day saw updates to notice pages with Rust version information. Several long-standing issues related to the Superchain Registry and Interop features were closed, indicating progress in refactoring and deprecating older functionalities. Discussions continued on various `op-node` and `op-supervisor` issues, particularly those related to EL Sync and Interop activation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Notice Page Updates**: The `fusaka-notice.mdx` and `upgrade-17.mdx` files were updated to include Rust version information, ensuring documentation reflects current technical details. ([#1878](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1878))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
None.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Superchain Registry 2.0 Implementation**: Several issues related to the Superchain Registry were closed, indicating successful refactoring and updates. This includes modifications to the `add-chain` tool to allow chains to opt into hardforks ([#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/610)), resolution of an L2 key handover test issue ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/643)), and improvements to the `golang-validate-all` CI job for better pass/fail summaries ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/644)).

## NEW ISSUES
None.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **`op-node` Interop and Sync-Start Logic**: Discussions on [#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16141) and [#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16140) highlight the need for `op-node`'s sync-start algorithm to be aware of Interop activation and the removal of the anchor point RPC. These issues were reopened by ajsutton, noting that several TODOs still reference them, emphasizing the need to track these items more formally.
*   **`op-supervisor` Multi-Node Support and Backward Compatibility**: Issue [#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16174) regarding dropping multi-node support in `op-supervisor` was reopened by ajsutton due to a remaining TODO. Similarly, [#16245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16245), concerning the removal of check-access-list backward compatibility, was reopened by ajsutton for the same reason, indicating ongoing work to streamline `op-supervisor` functionalities.
*   **Event System Refactor Comments Cleanup**: Issue [#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16917) was reopened by ajsutton, who noted that numerous TODOs still exist related to cleaning up comments from the event system refactor. This suggests that while the refactor is underway, documentation and comment hygiene require further attention.
*   **`op-node` EL Sync Behavior**: Discussions on [#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17631) (Initial EL Sync UX and Correctness), [#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18124) (Safe Head Advancement during EL Sync), and [#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18125) (Unsafe not rewound while `INVALID` during EL Sync) indicate ongoing analysis of `op-node`'s synchronization mechanisms. mslipper commented that these issues can be punted until the full deprecation of request/response sync, suggesting they are not immediate blockers but will require attention in the future.
*   **Fusaka-on-L2 Design Finalization**: Issue [#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/355) is awaiting finalization of the Fusaka-on-L2 design. mslipper commented that this will be finalized after checking with customers, indicating a user-centric approach to design decisions.
