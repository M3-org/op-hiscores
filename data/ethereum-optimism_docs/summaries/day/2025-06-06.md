## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Fault Proofs and Interop Challenges
Discussions continued on [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16166) regarding the `op-supervisor`'s ability to provide data for fault proofs with non-genesis interop. The core problem is that `op-challenger` doesn't fully support non-Genesis Interop upgrades, leading to invalid actions when proving the non-genesis activation block.

*   **Proposed Solutions:**
    *   One option is for `op-challenger` to manually construct pre-interop super roots directly from rollup nodes or via the supervisor as a proxy, as there's no risk of unresolved cross-dependencies before interop activation.
    *   Another option is to start indexing the safe DB in the supervisor from the first random derived block it receives, even if pre-interop, allowing it to serve super roots consistently. This would remove any special meaning of the first block in the safe DB.
*   **Current Status:** An implementation of the second option is underway. It was also noted that fixing this issue before moving forward with devnets is crucial, as the current code is not viable for the migration process.

### Improving L1 Origin Validity in op-supervisor
Discussions on [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16315) focused on improving the `op-supervisor`'s L1 origin validity handling during resets. The current reset logic only checks consistency between local and node safe databases, without verifying if the L1 origin of the found target is canonical.

*   **Key Points:**
    *   The supervisor should ensure that all provided targets are valid. If a target is invalid, the `op-node` should request another reset from the supervisor, rather than duplicating validity checks or walkbacks.
    *   This approach would reduce complexity and handle cases where the L1 chain changes during the reset bisection.
    *   It was noted that pre-interop, some of this functionality was handled by `sync.FindL2Heads`, which did check L1 origin canonicality.

### Incorrect Nonce for Pending Transactions
Issue [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/623) highlights that `eth_getTransactionCount` returns an incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending transactions, causing transactions to get stuck in the mempool. Users are seeking updates on the resolution of this issue.
