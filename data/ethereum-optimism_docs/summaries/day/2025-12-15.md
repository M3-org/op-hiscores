## NEW ISSUES

### Documentation and Tutorial Issues
- A new issue was opened regarding a problem with the `/governance/gov-faq` documentation page ([#1918](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1918)).
- A tutorial execution issue was reported for `create-l2-rollup-example`, specifically a failure during `make init` with a fee vault error ([#1919](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1919)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Node Synchronization and Client Compatibility
Discussions on [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581) highlighted issues with node synchronization, specifically "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. These errors are often linked to the L1 Execution Client's inability to provide necessary state data. Users reported similar problems with Publicnode snapshots and `op-geth` on various chains (Base, Optimism, Unichain). A request was made for more information on client configurations, full logs, and startup flags to aid in diagnosis.

### Interoperability and Replacement Transactions
Issue [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574) focused on evaluating and reworking injected replacement transactions for interop. The discussion revolved around the necessity of an additional deposit transaction for proofs and whether the Supernode could generate the required data without it. There was a consensus that simplifying the protocol by eliminating the extra deposit transaction for proofs is the best architectural solution. The next steps involve assigning someone to architecturally refactor this mechanism and updating the Interop specification.

### op-challenger Panic Related to BlobBaseFee
Issue [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18608) reported a panic in `op-challenger` due to an "invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference" when trying to record `BlobBaseFee`. The root cause is suspected to be an L1 client that does not support `BlobBaseFee` (e.g., an older Geth version not upgraded to Dencun). The reporter suggested adding a flag like `--data-availability-type=calldata` to prevent the panic. Information on the `op-challenger` version and L1 client configuration was requested to further investigate and patch the issue.

### Kona Interop Action Tests
Discussion on [#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18613) confirmed that this issue, concerning ensuring kona interop action tests are not disabled, is a duplicate of an existing issue in the `op-rs/kona` repository. Work is currently underway to get these tests functioning.

### Finalizing Upgrade 18 Releases
Issue [#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18548) discussed the finalization of Upgrade 18 releases. Questions were raised regarding the status of governance approval for `op-program` and any critical issues found on the testnet that could block or delay the finalization.

### Expensive Operations Offloading in Kona-SP1
Issue [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18533) addressed ensuring expensive operations in kona-sp1 are offloaded to the host. The discussion inquired about identifying all areas where `keccak` and `sha2` (and other expensive operations) are performed outside the EVM and require offloading via syscall, and if other cryptographic or computationally intensive operations might also need this approach.

### op-reth <-> op-geth Connection Flakiness
Issue [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18570) highlighted flakiness in `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` P2P connections in system tests. This was deemed a critical issue affecting test environment stability and potential production compatibility, requiring investigation into P2P implementation differences and `admin_peers` encoding.

### Run Precompile FP Tests on Jovian Fork
Issue [#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17348) was reopened due to a remaining TODO in the code related to running precompile FP tests on the Jovian fork.
