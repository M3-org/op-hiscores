# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Dec 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the identification of several critical issues, including a nil pointer dereference in op-challenger related to L1 blob support and a fuzzing test failure in OptimismPortal2. Discussions also continued on interop transaction evaluation and node synchronization problems.

## NEW ISSUES
### Documentation and Tutorial Issues
- An issue was reported regarding the `/governance/gov-faq` path [#1918](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1918).
- A tutorial for `create-l2-rollup-example` is failing with an error related to the fee vault being set to zero [#1919](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1919).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Fault Proof System Challenges
- **`op-challenger`: Invalid Memory Address or Nil Pointer Dereference** [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18608): The issue describes a nil pointer dereference in `op-challenger` when the L1 does not support `blobBaseFee`, likely due to an uninitialized field. The user confirmed using `op-challenger` version `untagged-09dfe35b-1748891588` and Geth `v1.13.15` on a local private chain that has not been upgraded to Dencun. The user suggested adding a flag similar to `--data-availability-type=calldata` to prevent the panic.

### Interoperability and Transaction Handling
- **Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx** [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574): Discussion revolves around the necessity of an additional transaction to record the block hash for the proofs system. `ajsutton` emphasized its criticality for preventing easy overwhelming of honest challengers. `axelKingsley` questioned if the Supernode could provide the necessary data, potentially simplifying the protocol. `Inphi` agreed that the Supernode should be able to generate proof data, suggesting simplification by not adding an extra deposit transaction.

### Node Synchronization and Client Compatibility
- **The Node is Not Synchronized** [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581): Users are experiencing `missing trie node` and `Failed to build payload` errors, indicating L1 Execution Client issues in providing state data to Op-Node. `rdin777` requested detailed information on client configurations (L1 Execution/Consensus clients, versions, full logs, and startup flags) to diagnose the problem. `tsulhc` noted similar issues with Publicnode snapshots but found success with `snapsync` using `--syncmode=execution-layer`.

### Protocol Security and Decentralization
- **`_7702Target = address(0)` will result in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` fuzzing test failure** [#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18554): A critical bug report highlights a fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when `_7702Target` is `address(0)`. `rdin777` stressed the severity of this issue, suggesting immediate prioritization with `bug` and `critical` labels, and assigning a contract developer to fix the logical error related to etching empty bytes.

### Superchain Ecosystem and Client Stability
- **`chore(sysgo/p2p)`: fix `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` connection flakiness** [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18570): An issue was identified regarding flaky P2P connections between `op-reth` and `op-geth` in system tests. `rdin777` recommended classifying this as a major bug or high-priority chore due to its impact on test stability and potential production compatibility, and suggested assigning a developer to investigate P2P implementation differences and `admin_peers` encoding.

### OP Stack Development and Optimization
- **`kona-sp1`: Ensure expensive operations are offloaded to the host** [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18533): The discussion focuses on optimizing `kona-sp1` for ZK Proofs by offloading expensive cryptographic operations like `keccak` and `sha2` to the host. `rdin777` inquired about the progress in identifying all areas where these operations occur outside the EVM and if other computationally intensive operations might require similar treatment.

### Release Management
- **Finalize U18 releases** [#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18548): This issue tracks the finalization of Upgrade 18 releases. `rdin777` requested an update on the status of governance approval for `op-program` and any critical issues found during testnet operations that could block or delay the finalization.
