## NEW ISSUES
### Documentation and Tutorial Issues
- An issue was reported regarding the `/governance/gov-faq` documentation path ([#1918](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1918)).
- A tutorial for `create-l2-rollup-example` is failing with a fee vault error during execution after `make init` ([#1919](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1919)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Fault Proof System Stability
- **`op-challenger` nil pointer dereference**: A critical bug was reported where `op-challenger` experiences a nil pointer dereference when the L1 does not support `blobBaseFee`, likely due to uninitialized fields related to BlobBaseFee metrics. The user provided details on their setup (op-challenger untagged-09dfe35b-1748891588, Geth v1.13.15 on a local private chain without Dencun upgrade) and suggested adding a flag similar to `--data-availability-type=calldata` to prevent the panic ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18608)).

### Interoperability and Transaction Handling
- **Interop: evaluate and rework injected replacement Tx**: Discussion continues on the necessity and implementation of replacement transactions for invalid interop transactions. There's a debate on whether the additional transaction recording the block hash is critical for the proofs system, with arguments for its importance in preventing overwhelming honest challengers and against its necessity if the Supernode can provide the required data ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574)).

### Node Synchronization and Client Compatibility
- **Node Synchronization Issues**: Users are reporting `missing trie node` and `Failed to build payload` errors, indicating L1 Execution Client issues in providing necessary state data to Op-Node. Requests for more information on client configurations (L1 Execution/Consensus clients, full logs, and startup flags) have been made to aid diagnosis ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581)).
- **`op-reth` <-> `op-geth` Connection Flakiness**: An issue was identified with P2P connection instability in system tests involving mixed `op-geth`/`op-reth` nodes. This is considered a critical bug affecting test environment stability and potential production compatibility, with a call for investigation into P2P implementation differences and `admin_peers` encoding ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18570)).

### Protocol Upgrades and Release Management
- **Finalize U18 releases**: An update was requested on the status of Upgrade 18 finalization, specifically regarding governance approval for `op-program` and any critical issues found during testnet operations ([#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18548)).

### Security and EVM Operations
- **`OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` fuzzing test failure**: A critical bug was reported where `_7702Target = address(0)` causes a fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction`, pointing to potential incorrect behavior when handling deposits with a zero address and its impact on aliasing. Immediate prioritization and assignment to a contract developer were suggested to fix the logical error ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18554)).
- **Kona-sp1: Ensure expensive operations are offloaded to the host**: Progress on optimizing `kona-sp1` for ZK Proofs by offloading expensive operations like `keccak` and `sha2` to the host is being tracked. Questions were raised about identifying all areas requiring syscall offloading and other potentially expensive cryptographic operations ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18533)).
