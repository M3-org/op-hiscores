## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the opening of two new issues, one concerning a governance FAQ path and another detailing an execution error in the `create-l2-rollup-example` tutorial. Discussions continued on several active issues, including interop transaction evaluation, node synchronization problems, and an `op-challenger` nil pointer dereference.

## NEW ISSUES

### Documentation and Tutorial Issues
- An issue was opened regarding a path in the governance FAQ documentation ([#1918](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1918)).
- A tutorial execution issue was reported for `create-l2-rollup-example`, specifically a failure during setup related to a fee vault set to zero ([#1919](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1919)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interoperability and Replacement Transactions
Discussion on [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574) (interop: evaluate and rework injected replacement Tx) centered on the necessity of additional transactions for the proofs system. @ajsutton emphasized that the transaction recording the replaced block hash is critical for the proofs system to prevent overwhelming honest challengers. @axelKingsley questioned if the Supernode could supply the necessary data, potentially simplifying the protocol by not adding an extra deposit transaction. @Inphi agreed that simplifying the protocol by not adding the extra deposit transaction would be worthwhile if the Supernode can generate what's needed for proof.

### Node Synchronization and Client Configuration
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581) (the node is not synchronized) saw @rdin777 requesting more information from @yaki-1337 regarding their L1 Execution and Consensus client configurations, full logs, and startup flags to diagnose "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. This indicates a potential issue with the L1 client providing necessary state data to the Op-Node.

### `op-challenger` Nil Pointer Dereference
On issue [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18608) (`op-challenger`: : invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference), @lyh169 provided further details, confirming the issue occurs with an older Geth version that does not support Dencun and Blob transactions. @rdin777 acknowledged the severity of the nil pointer dereference in `RecordBlobBaseFee` and requested the `op-challenger` version and L1 client details to investigate the initialization of `txmgr` metrics. @lyh169 suggested adding a flag like `--data-availability-type=calldata` to `op-challenger` to prevent the panic.

### Kona Interop Action Tests
Issue [#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18613) (Ensure that kona interop action tests are not disabled) was identified by @Inphi as a duplicate of `op-rs/kona/issues/3010`, confirming the need to get these tests working and that work is currently in progress.

### Kona-SP1 Optimization
Discussion on [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18533) (kona-sp1: Ensure expensive operations are offloaded to the host) involved @rdin777 asking @lnphi for an update on identifying all areas where expensive operations like keccak and sha2 need offloading and if other cryptographic operations might require similar treatment.

### U18 Release Finalization
On issue [#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18548) (Finalize U18 releases), @rdin777 requested an update from @pauldownman on the status of governance approval for `op-program` and any critical issues found on the testnet that could block or delay the U18 release finalization.

### `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` Fuzzing Test Failure
Issue [#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18554) (`_7702Target = address(0)` will result in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` fuzzing test failure) saw @rdin777 emphasizing the criticality of the reported fuzzing test failure, suggesting immediate prioritization with `bug` and `critical` labels, and assigning a contract developer to address the logical error in handling deposits with a zero address.

### `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` Connection Flakiness
Regarding [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18570) (chore(sysgo/p2p): fix op-reth <-> op-geth connection flakiness), @rdin777 recommended classifying this as a major bug or high-priority chore due to its impact on test environment stability and potential production compatibility. They also suggested assigning someone to investigate the P2P implementation differences and `admin_peers` encoding.

### Run Precompile FP Tests on Jovian Fork
Issue [#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17348) (Run precompile FP tests on Jovian fork) was reopened by @ajsutton due to an existing TODO in the code related to this task.
