## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Abnormal CPU Usage in op-geth
Discussion continued on [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/613) concerning abnormal CPU usage with `op-geth` v1.101511.0. `jsvisa` provided detailed command-line arguments for `cpuchainorg` to enable metrics and capture `pprof` data to diagnose the CPU consumption. `cpuchainorg` reiterated that the issue persists even after index upgrades, suggesting a potential bug in a goroutine. `hekich` noted that in their case, the CPU usage returned to normal after the index upgrade completed, which took less than 24 hours.

### Refactoring `signFromChildMultisig` Output
Community members expressed interest in contributing to [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/781), which aims to reduce noisy terminal output from the `signFromChildMultisig` function. `Mau1401` and `JoseValperga` (the latter highlighting Solidity experience and focus on user-friendly output) both offered to work on the issue. `nsancheznez` also inquired about working on it.
