## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **`cannonKonaPrestate` Documentation for Upgrades**
  Discussion on [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18095) continued regarding the need to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for standard chain upgrades. The latest comment from ajsutton indicates that the docs team has been provided with a one-pager that includes this mention. Previously, Inphi noted that this is a concern for the U18 upgrade and that highlighting this requirement in the Optimism docs makes sense.

- **`op-program` vm-compat for go1.25 Fix**
  A new issue, [#18334](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18334), was opened concerning the `vm-compat` program failing to analyze go1.25 binaries. The issue describes an error related to "not handled modification of register in r-type instruction". ajsutton provided a potential code hack as a temporary solution, though expressing uncertainty about its correctness.
