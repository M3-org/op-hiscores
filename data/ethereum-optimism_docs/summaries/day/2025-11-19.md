**Min-Base-Fee Simulation Conclusion**
The issue [#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16958), which focused on conducting simulations to prove the effectiveness of the `min-base-fee` feature, has been closed. The current approach is to observe the feature's performance in production rather than conducting further simulations.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Documenting `cannonKonaPrestate` Requirement**
Discussions are ongoing regarding [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18095), which aims to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades. The latest update indicates that a one-pager has been provided to the docs team, including mention of the need to provide a Kona prestate. Previously, it was noted that this requirement is a concern for the U18 upgrade and should be highlighted in the Optimism documentation.
