# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Sep 19, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant documentation enhancement, specifically updating the L2 rollup testnet tutorial to reflect the latest `op-d` tools. Additionally, two dependency updates were initiated, and an issue regarding redundant address structs was closed. A new issue was opened to establish a convention for network upgrade transactions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced L2 Rollup Testnet Tutorial
A comprehensive and modernized tutorial for deploying an OP Stack testnet chain using the latest `op-d` tools was added. This update significantly improves the documentation for chain operators. ([#1705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705))

### Dependency Updates
Two pull requests were opened to update project dependencies, specifically `brace-expansion` and `next`. ([#1747](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1747), [#1748](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1748))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Dependency Updates:** Two pull requests were opened to bump the versions of `brace-expansion` from 1.1.11 to 1.1.12 ([#1747](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1747)) and `next` from 14.2.21 to 14.2.32 ([#1748](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1748)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Address Struct Standardization
The issue concerning the duplication of address structs across various packages was closed, with the intended scope of work completed. ([#14977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/14977))

## NEW ISSUES

### Network Upgrade Transaction Convention
A new issue was opened to establish a new convention for Network Upgrade Transactions, particularly for those that deploy new contracts. The current practice of choosing a `from` address with `nonce=0` is being re-evaluated due to its impact on deployed contract addresses. ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/781))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Enshrine new convention for Network Upgrade Transactions which deploy new contracts ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/781))
The discussion revolves around establishing a new convention for `from` addresses in network upgrade transactions that deploy new contracts. @protolambda provided a detailed note on address collision resistance for the suggested approach, comparing `CREATE`, `CREATE2`, and the proposed upgrade source-hash computation. They highlighted that the start of the keccak preimage always differs, preventing collisions. As an extra safety measure, @protolambda suggested using the `CREATE2` computation with a system address as the deployer and the source-hash as the salt, to fit within existing address computation frameworks and prevent future collisions.
