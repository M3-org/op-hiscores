# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Jun 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on documentation fixes, including navigation and hardware date updates, alongside the addition of a new tutorial for relaying arbitrary log messages. Node operator configurations were also updated.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Bug Fixes
Several documentation issues were addressed, including a fix for a navigation problem within the `pages/stack/smart-contracts` section ([#1659](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1659)) and an update to the hardware requirements date in the node operator tutorial ([#1662](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1662)).

### New Interoperability Tutorial
A new tutorial was added explaining how to relay arbitrary log messages using attestations, enhancing the `pages/interop/tutorials` section ([#1613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1613)).

### Node Operator Configuration Updates
Updates were made to the `execution-config.mdx` to align `devp2p/disc` defaults with OP EL's default discovery topology ([#1565](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1565)). Additionally, the U16 challenger version was updated in relevant notices and metrics documentation ([#1658](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1658)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#1660](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1660): Update op-challenger version for upgrade 16 to 1.5.1.
*   [#1661](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1661): U16 contract upgrades.
*   [#1663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1663): Updating the cross domain messenger overview.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dependency Resolution
The issue concerning the missing `dist` directory in `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` versions after `10.0.238` was closed ([#1146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1146)). This was resolved by the merge of [#1161](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1161).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI Flakiness Investigation
Discussions on [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16271) (Investigate and improve flakiness) indicate ongoing efforts to address CI instability. The latest comment from scharissis (Jun 24, 2025) confirms the release of a test flake report generator, its iteration with Protocol feedback, and publicization, leading to improved test flakiness. Previous comments highlighted specific flaky acceptance tests and the observation that much of the flakiness was due to CircleCI machine, networking, and infrastructure issues.

### Acceptance Test Reliability
The issue [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16378) (Improve reliability of acceptance tests) was closed on Jul 9, 2025, with nonsense stating that tests have been considerably improved and that continuous monitoring and improvement will be maintained. Earlier discussions on Jun 13, 2025, by scharissis pointed to a new "Flakiness Report" and the inclusion of "Job Name" to help identify the source of flakiness. Nonsense also noted that certain packages and tests, like `op-acceptance-tests/tests/interop/reorgs` and `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor`, passed with `-count=5`, indicating some progress in stability. The discussion also touched upon the importance of measuring flakiness by package rather than by individual test, as shared environments can influence results.
