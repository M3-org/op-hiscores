# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw no new features, bug fixes, or documentation enhancements. However, there was significant discussion on active issues related to node synchronization, interop transaction evaluation, and proof action testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No completed work to report for this period.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No newly opened pull requests to report for this period.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation of Cannon-Kona Prestate Requirement
The issue [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18095) regarding the documentation of the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades was closed as done. This issue aimed to ensure that standard chains always set the `cannon-kona` prestate, a requirement for the U18 upgrade.

### Governance FAQ Issue Resolution
Issue [#1918](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1918), which pointed to a problem on the `/governance/gov-faq` documentation page, was closed.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues to report for this period.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Node Synchronization Challenges
Discussions on [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581) continued, focusing on issues with node synchronization, specifically "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. The latest comments from @yaki-1337 indicate that the full node is being used without an archive, and there were no improper shutdowns. @yaki-1337 is using OP-GETH and is considering switching to Reth, also asking for guidance on where to download OP-GETH now. @rdin777 previously suggested that these errors often point to an incomplete or corrupted state database and asked for clarification on the client configuration and logs.

### Interop: Evaluating and Reworking Injected Replacement Transactions
The conversation on [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574) revolved around simplifying the protocol by eliminating the additional deposit transaction for proofs in interop. @ajsutton highlighted the two downsides of having the super node just record the data: lack of consensus check for accuracy and data availability only if derivation is run locally. However, @ajsutton noted that these are not showstoppers and become less of a concern with ZK proofs. @rdin777 summarized the consensus to simplify the protocol and suggested assigning someone for architectural refactoring and updating the Interop specification.

### Reworking Proofs Action Testing for Supernodes
Issue [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18621) saw further discussion on adapting proof action testing to the Supernode architecture. @ajsutton emphasized that challenger tests require running against a real Supernode to accurately test the interaction between the challenger and Supernode. @ajsutton also questioned how the actual Supernode implementation would be tested and suggested that if a better approach exists for testing these scenarios in Supernode, rewriting the proofs tests to fit that approach would be worthwhile. @Inphi agreed that action tests might be overkill for testing only the proof program but was less certain about a better way to test `op-challenger` for interop, especially given the intrusiveness required for test setup.

### Use File-Relative Paths Instead of Project-Relative
Discussion on [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/10202) continued with @manu-qiro confirming that context-aware remappings, as suggested by @alexkeating, solved the issue for them. This issue addresses the problem of project-relative paths in imports causing compilation failures, with a proposed solution of using file-relative paths for better portability.
