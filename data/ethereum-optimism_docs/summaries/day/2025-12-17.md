## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Node Synchronization and Database Corruption
Discussion on [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581) continued with user `yaki-1337` reporting persistent synchronization issues, specifically "missing trie node" errors, even after deleting and attempting to re-download OP-GETH. `rdin777` provided troubleshooting steps, inquiring about the node type (full/archive), shutdown history, and execution client, suggesting `yaki-1337` might consider switching to Reth or using the `--syncmode=full` flag.

### Interoperability and Replacement Transactions
Issue [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574) saw active debate regarding the necessity of injected replacement transactions for invalid interop transactions. `Inphi` and `axelKingsley` discussed simplifying the protocol by removing the additional deposit transaction for ZK proofs, as the Supernode should be able to generate necessary data. `ajsutton` highlighted the importance of the additional transaction for the current fault proof system to avoid overwhelming challengers, but acknowledged that with ZK, the concerns might diminish, making protocol simplification more appealing.

### Proofs Action Testing for Supernodes
The discussion in [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18621) revolved around re-evaluating the proofs action testing approach for compatibility with the Supernode architecture. `ajsutton` emphasized the need for challenger tests to run against a real Supernode to accurately test interactions. `Inphi` suggested that while action tests might be overkill for testing only the proof program, they could be crucial for `op-challenger` in interop scenarios, especially if the Supernode records blocks that fail interop validity checks.

### File-Relative Paths vs. Project-Relative Paths
Issue [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/10202) saw recent comments from `manu-qiro` confirming that context-aware remappings, as suggested by `alexkeating`, resolved their compilation issues related to project-relative paths. This indicates a potential solution for the problem of `foundry` and `Remix` failing to correctly import dependencies when using project-relative paths.
