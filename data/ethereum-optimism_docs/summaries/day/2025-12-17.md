## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Node Synchronization and Trie Node Errors
Discussions continued on an issue regarding node synchronization problems, specifically "missing trie node" errors. The latest comments from @yaki-1337 and @rdin777 focused on debugging steps, including clarifying the type of node (full vs. archive), checking for unclean shutdowns, and identifying the execution client (op-geth or reth). @yaki-1337 mentioned deleting everything and asked for guidance on where to download OP-GETH or if it's time to switch to Reth.

### Interop Transaction Evaluation and Rework
The issue concerning the evaluation and rework of injected replacement transactions for interop saw further discussion. @ajsutton highlighted the downsides of the supernode just recording data, emphasizing the lack of consensus checks and potential data unavailability for challengers. @rdin777 summarized a consensus to simplify the protocol by eliminating the additional deposit transaction for proofs and suggested assigning someone for architectural refactoring and updating the Interop specification. [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574)

### Reworking Proofs Action Testing for Supernodes
Discussions on reworking proofs action testing to support Supernodes continued. @ajsutton questioned how the actual Supernode implementation would be tested and suggested that if a better approach exists for testing these scenarios in Supernode, rewriting the proofs tests to fit that approach would be worthwhile. @Inphi noted that while action tests might be overkill for testing only the proof program, they are less certain about a better way to test `op-challenger` for interop, especially given the intrusiveness required to generate scenarios for the super STF. [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18621)

### File-Relative vs. Project-Relative Paths
The ongoing discussion about using file-relative paths instead of project-relative paths in the documentation saw a new comment from @manu-qiro. They stated that "context aware remappings" solved the issue for them, referencing a previous suggestion by @alexkeating. This indicates a potential solution for the problem of project-relative paths causing compilation issues. [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/10202)
