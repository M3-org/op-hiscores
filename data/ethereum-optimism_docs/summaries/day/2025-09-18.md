## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-node: Prepare for Fusaka Hardfork
Discussion on [#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17493) continued with a comment from geoknee noting that tight coupling to upstream Geth code could necessitate absolute prestate updates with every upstream merge and `op-geth`/`op-node` release. The issue focuses on ensuring compatibility for the derivation pipeline, specifically converting excess blob gas into L1 cost and hardcoding Fusaka and blob parameters for EIP 7892.

### op-acceptor Configuration and Parallelism Improvements
Discussions on `op-acceptor` issues concluded today. Issue [#461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/461), concerning logging all configuration at start-up and in the HTML report, was marked as done by scharissis, referencing a pull request in the `infra` repository. Similarly, issue [#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/462), which aimed to improve package parallelism to correctly support `t.Parallel()` and `devtest.ParallelT()`, was also marked as done by scharissis, referencing the same `infra` pull request.
