# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Oct 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on refining documentation, specifically by removing a duplicated L1_BEACON_URL and adding missing redirects to improve navigation and accuracy within the `create-l2-rollup-example` and other documentation sections.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Cleanup and Accuracy
- Removed a duplicated `L1_BEACON_URL` from the `create-l2-rollup-example/.example.env` file, enhancing documentation accuracy and reducing redundancy ([#1806](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1806)).

### Redirects and Navigation Improvements
- Added missing redirects, impacting files such as `create-l2-rollup-example/docker-compose.yml`, `create-l2-rollup-example/scripts/setup-rollup.sh`, `docs.json`, and `pages/notices/upgrade-16a.mdx`, to ensure smoother navigation and correct page routing ([#1805](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1805)).
