## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node` Invalid Block Signature
A user reported encountering an "op-node invalid block signature unrecognized signer" error while deploying on the testnet ([#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17448)). Another user commented today, stating they have the same problem and are seeking a solution.

### Proxyd Backwards Time Travel
Discussion continued on the issue of Proxyd potentially returning previous blocks as `unsafe` if backends are not in sync, leading to "backwards time travel" ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/501)). The latest comment from @joshklop acknowledged an update from @yashvardhan-kukreja, who plans to focus on this issue from January 1st, 2026, onwards. Previously, @yashvardhan-kukreja had brainstormed several approaches, including a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call`, Proxyd being aware of "block out of range" errors, and IP-based or signature-based sticky sessions, each with its own pros and cons.
