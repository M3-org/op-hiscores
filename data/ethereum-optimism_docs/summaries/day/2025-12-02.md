### Proxyd Backwards Time Travel Issue
Discussion continued on the `proxyd` issue where backwards time travel is possible when backends are not in sync ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/501)). The latest comment from `joshklop` acknowledged an update from `yashvardhan-kukreja`, who plans to focus on this issue from January 1st, 2026, and expressed no immediate concerns. Previous discussions included brainstorming various approaches to address the problem, such as multicall strategies, backend fallback mechanisms, and sticky sessions based on IP or signatures, each with its own trade-offs.
