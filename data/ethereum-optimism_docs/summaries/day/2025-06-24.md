# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Jun 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on documentation improvements, including fixing typos in the `op-deployer` documentation and updating `supersim` reference docs. Several issues were closed, notably those related to CI flakiness and a feature request for deterministic gas testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Documentation Refinements for Operator Tools**
    *   Fixed formatting typos in the `op-deployer` documentation, enhancing readability for chain operators ([#1667](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1667)).

*   **Supersim Reference Documentation Updates**
    *   Added missing commands and help text to the `supersim` documentation, specifically for the `fork` and `vanilla` commands, ensuring comprehensive reference material for app developers ([#1669](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1669)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **CI Stability and Performance Improvements**
    *   An issue tracking the investigation and improvement of CI flakiness was closed, with progress noted on a test flake report generator and ongoing monitoring ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16271)).
    *   A spike exploring the adoption of internal SLAs for the continuous integration pipeline was closed, with a decision not to implement CI SLAs for now ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16437)).

*   **Developer Tooling and Testing Enhancements**
    *   A feature request to enable deterministic gas testing by setting a fixed base fee was closed, with the understanding that adapting tests to query `baseFee` is a more suitable approach ([#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/408)).
    *   An issue related to porting `TestWithdrawalsRoot` to devstack was closed, as the implementation was completed in a related pull request ([#412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/412)).

*   **Bridging Documentation Clarification**
    *   A suggestion regarding bridging ERC-20 tokens with Viem was closed, as the issue had been addressed by a previous PR providing a complete implementation for token bridging using Viem ([#1508](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1508)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **`op-node` Goroutine Stuck Issues** ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16332))
    *   Users continue to report `op-node` (v1.13.3) getting stuck with thousands of goroutines after several hours of uptime, primarily in `select`, `IO wait`, or `yamux` session handlers, leading to sync issues. The problem persists for multiple users on the same version.
