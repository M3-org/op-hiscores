# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Oct 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a documentation update for analytics tools, specifically regarding Dune. Several issues related to the 2024 Q4 audit were opened, and existing issues concerning dispute game implementation, RPC provider coordination, and DA footprint block limit specifications were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Analytics Tools Documentation
- Updated `analytics-tools.mdx` to reflect changes related to Dune, improving the accuracy of documentation for application developers using these tools ([#1784](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1784)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dispute Game Implementation
- The issue regarding the use of v2 dispute game implementation in OPCM.deploy was closed, though a comment indicated a remaining TODO in the code ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17257)).

### RPC Provider Coordination
- Coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers around the new Flashblocks RPC node was completed, with most providers having gone ahead and Blockscout acknowledging to complete it later in the week ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17857)).

### Data Availability Footprint
- The issue concerning the update of DA footprint block limit specifications with the latest design was closed, confirming the use of the `blobBaseFee` header field instead of modifying `gasUsed` ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/792)).

## NEW ISSUES

### 2024 Q4 Audit Documentation
- Two new issues were opened to track updates required for the 2024 Q4 audit, each specifying a page path and acceptance criteria for the necessary documentation changes ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1789), [#1790](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1790)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Use v2 dispute game implementation in OPCM.deploy ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17257))
The issue was reopened due to a remaining TODO in the code related to the v2 dispute game implementation. This indicates that while progress has been made, further work is needed to fully resolve the implementation and remove the placeholder.

### Coordinate with Flashblocks RPC providers around the new Flashblocks RPC node ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17857))
The issue was closed with a comment confirming that most RPC providers have completed the coordination, with Blockscout expected to follow suit later in the week. This suggests successful outreach and integration with the new Flashblocks RPC node.

### Update DA footprint block limit specs with latest design ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/792))
The issue was closed, referencing PR #800, which likely contains the changes to update the DA footprint block limit specifications. This indicates that the documentation has been updated to reflect the new design using `blobBaseFee` instead of `gasUsed`.
