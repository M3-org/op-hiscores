# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Oct 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing documentation for creating L2 rollups with example code. Several issues related to the Isthmus upgrade, L2CL<>L2EL syncing conditions, and acceptance testing were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced L2 Rollup Creation Documentation
- Documentation was updated to clarify how containers are run and to reflect the target version for L2 rollup creation.
- Example code and related files were added to provide a practical guide for users creating L2 rollups, covering aspects like environment setup, Makefile, Docker Compose, and scripts for deploying and setting up the rollup components ([#1775](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1775)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Isthmus Upgrade Tracking
- The tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade was closed as the upgrade is now complete ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/12703)).

### L2EL Syncing Conditions
- An issue investigating the conditions for L2EL to start syncing was closed, with the conclusion that the process is likely handled by `engineController.insertUnsafePayload` after initial EL Sync runs ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17628)).

### Acceptance Test Reporting
- The issue to include setup information in the HTML output of `op-acceptance-test` was closed, indicating the feature has been implemented ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/386)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### cannon: Support go1.25 ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17060))
Discussion today confirmed that the Go 1.25 compatibility issue significantly affects Cannon, specifically causing incorrect Keccak hashes when running in Cannon with Go 1.25. This prevents correct block hash calculations. A detailed diagnosis is available, and the underlying problem is linked to a known Go issue. While Go 1.25.1 has been released, it does not appear to include the necessary MIPS fix.

### op-acceptance-test: add back op-reth to jovian kt-devnet ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17475))
The latest comment suggests that since Kurtosis devnet is deprecated, the focus should shift to integrating `op-reth` into the `devstack` / `sysgo` system instead of adding it back to the `jovian kt-devnet`. This implies a change in strategy for `op-reth` integration.
