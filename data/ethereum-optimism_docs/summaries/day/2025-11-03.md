## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Updates
A minor update was made to a notice page within the documentation. This change is part of ongoing content maintenance. [#1829](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1829)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#1828](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1828), was opened to update details regarding sender address modification for L1 to L2 transactions.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Reporting
The issue [#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16273), which aimed to discover and report unused acceptance tests, was closed. The decision was made as the team has largely switched to using gateless mode for tests, rendering the original goal less relevant.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Documentation
Discussion continued on issue [#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1742), which concerns documenting the DA Footprint Limit. The latest comment suggests that this issue could be tracked alongside [#1710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1710), which focuses on documenting the MinBaseFee feature, as the concepts are considered self-explanatory and related.
