## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain-Ops Tooling and CI/CD Enhancements
- Completed work on improving the OPCM Migrate Script, including sanity checks for inputs. ([#16326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16326))
- Implemented "stacked" simulations in CI, allowing for sequential execution of tasks with incrementing nonces and addressing previous nonce coordination challenges. ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/342), [#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/337))
- Addressed issues related to `SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER` usage, ensuring more robust simulation behavior. ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/448))
- Updated task paths and fetch-task scripts to correctly reference mainnet task directories, improving the accuracy of simulations and operations. ([#547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/547), [#600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/600), [#548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/548))
- Completed the setup of training calls and created Loom videos for the new Superchain-ops tooling, enhancing user adoption and understanding. ([#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/514))
- Refactored `MultisigTask` architecture and updated tests to use `stdStorage` and `SafeTestTools`, improving maintainability and readability. ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/636), [#605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/605))
- Enhanced CI job performance for template regression tests by optimizing chain discovery. ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/648))
- Implemented checks for domain and message hashes in CI simulations against `VALIDATIONS.md`, ensuring consistency and security. ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/679))
- Improved the granularity of `addresses.json` checking to reduce the frequency of `scr` submodule updates. ([#753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/753))
- Enhanced the user experience for overriding nonces within the Superchain-ops flow. ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/770))
- Fixed an issue where `StateOverrideManager` always added the nonce as a state override, streamlining the override process. ([#814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/814))
- Ensured that templates check against `StandardValidator` contracts where appropriate, improving validation logic. ([#838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/838))
- Added a quick way to read addresses for chains not yet in the Superchain Registry, improving flexibility for upgrades. ([#923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/923))
- Closed an issue related to testing Sepolia task for transferring ownership of ProtocolVersions, as templates for L1 and L2 owner transfers are now implemented. ([#554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/554))
- Closed an issue regarding making a mainnet example for OPCM template, as many examples for various OPCM versions are now available. ([#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/651))
- Closed an issue regarding prevalidations not being hindered by address registry availability, as prevalidations can now be performed in task `_templateSetup` functions. ([#654](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/654))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Release Pipeline Automation and GoReleaser Integration
- **[#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16097) Use GoReleaser for op-node/batcher/proposer/challenger release pipeline**: Discussion continues on automating the release pipeline for core OP Stack components. The latest comment from `geoknee` suggests wiring up `op-workbench release-notes` to automatically execute `git cliff` commands for changelog generation and potentially push to GitHub via API, aiming for a more automated and consistent release note process. Previous comments highlighted the need for a unified build system, avoiding further bloat from multiple build methods (docker bake, makefiles, justfiles), and ensuring GoReleaser is approached from a monorepo-first perspective.

### op-geth CPU Usage and Performance
- **[#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/613) Abnormal CPU usage with latest op-geth ( v1.101511.0 )**: Users are reporting high CPU usage with `op-geth v1.101511.0`. The latest comments from `PierrickGT` and `jsvisa` focus on how to enable and capture pprof metrics to diagnose the CPU consumption. `PierrickGT` shared a `profile.pb.gz` and noted that the issue might be due to an index update, which took about 24 hours to complete on their system. `jsvisa` previously suggested that the high CPU usage is temporary due to a log indexing rebuild in the backported go-ethereum v1.15.11.

### Terminal Output Refactoring
- **[#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/781) Refactor signFromChildMultisig to reduce noisy terminal output**: Community members are actively engaging with this issue, expressing interest in contributing to reduce the verbosity of `MultisigTask.sol`'s `signFromChildMultisig` function. `JoseValperga` and `Mau1401` have offered to work on this, aiming to make the terminal output cleaner and more user-friendly by focusing on critical signing information. `Cass402` identified that the `print` function within `simulateRun` is the primary cause of the noisy output and proposed removing or commenting it out.

### Interop Devnet vs. Supersim
- **[#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/399) what's the difference between supersim and interop kurtosis devnet?**: The discussion clarifies the distinction between `supersim` and `kurtosis` devnets. `zhiqiangxu`'s latest comment seeks to confirm if `supersim` is primarily for testing dapps rather than chains, with `kurtosis` being used for chain testing. `fainashalts` previously explained that `supersim` is a lighter-weight wrapper around Anvil for testing multichain/interop applications, particularly for dapps planning to launch when interop is live on mainnet.
