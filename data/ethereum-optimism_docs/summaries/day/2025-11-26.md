### ZK Proof Generation and Execution Strategy
Discussions on [#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18319) and [#18325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18325) centered on the optimal service for ZK proof generation and how to support ZK execution in the vm-runner. Inphi suggested that the succinct Rust challenger should generate ZK proofs due to the ongoing transition to a Rust stack and the existing SP1 library integrations. For vm-runner, Inphi noted that ZK execution would need to be written in Rust, potentially by embedding a Rust executor within the Docker image or adding an option to the vm-runner.

### ZK Game Challenging Mechanisms
Issue [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18322) explored how to support challenging ZK games. Inphi commented that the challenger logic is straightforward and could be reimplemented in op-challenger, acknowledging that the Rust challenger might eventually consume all challenging functionalities in the long term.

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency Refinement
The discussion on [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18347) revolved around removing the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry`. Inphi clarified that the sanity check for the same AnchorStateRegistry (ASR) is a valuable defense mechanism against accidentally using the wrong ASR. They suggested expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface to require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method to maintain this check.

### Runbook Routing for Proofs System
Issue [#18372](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18372) focused on documenting a process for routing to the correct runbook for the Proofs system. Inphi provided a link to a "Universal Proofs Runbook" on Notion, indicating progress on this documentation effort.
