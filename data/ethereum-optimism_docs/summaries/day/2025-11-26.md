# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Nov 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on strategic discussions around ZK proof generation and challenging mechanisms, alongside refining dispute game dependencies and documenting runbook routing for the Proofs system. A new pull request was opened to update batcher throttling documentation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **ZK Proof Generation and Challenger Strategy**
  Discussions on [#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18319) and [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18322) centered on where ZK proofs should be generated and how ZK games should be challenged. It was suggested that the Succinct Rust challenger should generate ZK proofs due to the ongoing transition to a Rust stack and its native interaction with SP1 libraries. For challenging ZK games, while the logic is straightforward enough for `op-challenger`, the long-term strategy might involve the Rust challenger as the Rust stack expands.
- **VM-Runner ZK Execution Support**
  Issue [#18325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18325) discussed updating the `vm-runner` to support ZK execution. The main point raised was that the actual ZK execution would need to be written in Rust, given its dependency on SP1, but an option could be added to `vm-runner` to drive this executor.
- **Refining AnchorStateRegistry Dependencies**
  On [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18347), the conversation revolved around removing the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry`. The consensus was that while the sanity check for the same ASR is valuable, it might be better to expand the `IDisputeGame` interface to explicitly require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method, rather than relying on a cast that might not work for all game types.
- **Proofs System Runbook Routing**
  Issue [#18372](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18372) saw the completion of a runbook for the Universal Proofs system, which aims to clarify which runbook to use for any given proofs deployment based on on-chain information. The runbook has been produced and is available at a Notion link.
