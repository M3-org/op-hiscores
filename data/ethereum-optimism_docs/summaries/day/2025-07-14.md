# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Jul 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on a documentation update for node operators, specifically regarding the `p2p.sync.onlyreqtostatic` flag. Discussions continued on several active issues, including sync testing, interop transaction re-injection, and stress testing the expiry window.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Node Operator Documentation Update**
    *   Updated `consensus-config.mdx` to document the `p2p.sync.onlyreqtostatic` flag, which restricts sync to static peers ([#1688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1688)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Resolved Nonce Errors in Execution**
    *   An issue related to nonce errors when approving and executing after one approval was closed, indicating a resolution ([#1106](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1106)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **[Tracking] op-sync-tester: service for mock EL sync testing** ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16452))
    *   Discussion revolved around session management for the `op-sync-tester`. @protolambda suggested using a UUID in the URL for session identification to avoid special RPC steps, leveraging HTTP middleware to attach session info to the context. @pcw109550 proposed a session management flow involving a `sync_init` RPC to initialize an API endpoint and return a session ID, with the sync tester registering a new endpoint for stateful proxying of CL requests.

*   **Consider making VerifyOPCM a wrapper around DeployImplementations for v2** ([#16653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16653))
    *   @maurelian stated that auditors felt `VerifyOPCM` provides redundancy and complements `DeployImplementations.s.sol`, acting as a check if either script is modified. A suggested approach is to re-run `DeployImplementations` within `VerifyOPCM` alongside other checks.

*   **E2E: Invalid Interop Tx Reinjection Test** ([#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16656))
    *   @pcw109550 outlined a testing approach using `op-test-sequencer` to force invalid execution messages, then checking for reorgs of invalid blocks, absence of invalid interop transactions in new L2 blocks, and their removal from the mempool. Reference was made to a PR for inspecting the mempool.

*   **interop: Stress test expiry window** ([#15285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15285))
    *   @pauldowman clarified that the "consolidation step" refers to the final stage in the fault proof program where executing messages are validated after derivation. @mds1 sought clarification on the term.

*   **op-batcher: duplicate code** ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16677))
    *   @geoknee acknowledged the observation by @chuwt regarding duplicate `checkTxpool` calls and welcomed a PR to address it.
