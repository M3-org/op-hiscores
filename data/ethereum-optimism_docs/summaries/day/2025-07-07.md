# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Jul 7, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day's focus was on documentation refinement, including a new guide for chain operators and several updates to ensure consistent terminology and capitalization across various sections. A broken link was also fixed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Refinement and Consistency
Efforts were made to standardize terminology and capitalization across the documentation. This included updating "crosschain" to "cross-chain" ([#1672](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1672)), ensuring proper capitalization for product names like "Superchain" and "Supersim" ([#1677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1677)), unifying case for terms like "L2toL2" to "L2ToL2" ([#1678](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1678)), and standardizing "Blockspace Charters" and "Standard Rollup Charter" ([#1679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1679)). Capitalization of "L1 Date Fee" was also corrected ([#1680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1680)).

### Operator Guides and Tutorials
A new tutorial guide was added to assist chain operators in setting up their proposer after initial configuration ([#1645](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1645)). Additionally, corrections were made to the upgrade 16 instructions ([#1684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1684)).

### Bug Fixes
A broken link to Vitalik's website was fixed, resolving a 404 error ([#1683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1683)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interop Logic and Flashblocks Validation
An issue related to adding a mode to `op-node` for pre-Interop logic in trivial-Interop cases was closed, with the decision to no longer prioritize it ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16520)). Another issue concerning the flashblocks gate's awareness of `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` was closed, with an associated PR mentioned ([#16630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16630)).

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-node: Add mode to use pre-Interop logic in trivial-Interop case ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16520))
This issue, created on June 20, 2025, aimed to add a mode to `op-node` to use pre-Interop logic when no supervisor RPC is provided, allowing it to function without a supervisor in trivial Interop cases. The discussion included a suggestion from tynes on July 7, 2025, to consider running services in the same process, similar to `op-e2e` or `sysgo`. However, the issue was closed on July 9, 2025, by tynes, stating that it would no longer be prioritized.
