## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Token Bridging Clarification
Discussion continued on [#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1203) regarding a token bridging issue. A maintainer clarified that `@superbridgeapp` is not responsible for the repository and suggested that the token in question might not be an `OptimismMintableERC20`, which would explain why a bridge address was not generated. Verification of the token's implementation was recommended to confirm this assumption.

### Protocol System Configuration Cleanup
Ongoing discussion on [#771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/771) suggests improvements for `protocol/system-config.md`. A new suggestion was made to include both the numerical value and the canonical name (e.g., `MIN_BASE_FEE` and `6`) for config update enums, rather than just the name.

### Flaky Test Investigation
The issue [#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17298) concerning the flakiness of `TestPreNoInbox` received an update. Another flake was reported, and it was noted that a recent pull request ([#17495](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17495)) did not resolve the issue.
