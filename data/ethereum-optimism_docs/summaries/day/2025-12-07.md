## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Devnet Deployment Warnings ([#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1898))
Discussion on this issue clarifies that "failed to publish newly created block" and "invalid block signature" warnings observed during devnet deployment using `create-l2-rollup-example` are not problematic for a local devnet. These warnings occur because the op-node attempts to publish blocks to the P2P network, but the peer does not recognize the block signature.
