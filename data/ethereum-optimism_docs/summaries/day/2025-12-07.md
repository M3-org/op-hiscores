## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Devnet Deployment Warnings
Discussion on [#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1898) clarifies that warnings observed during devnet deployment, such as "failed to publish newly created block" and "invalid block signature," are not problematic for a local devnet. These warnings occur because the op-node attempts to publish blocks to the P2P network, but the peer does not recognize the block signature.
