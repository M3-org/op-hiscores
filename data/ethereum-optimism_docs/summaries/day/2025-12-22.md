### op-challenger Trace Output Review
Discussion on [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18643) continued regarding the correct trace output when the next super root is not found. The latest comment from ajsutton confirms that this works correctly in the super node trace provider and suggests keeping the issue open until an integration test confirms `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Inphi previously identified this as a real problem, noting that `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash with insufficient data and questioned the correctness of a specific test.
