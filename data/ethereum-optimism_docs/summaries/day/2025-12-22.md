### op-challenger Trace Output Review
Discussion continued on [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18643) regarding the correct trace output when the next super root is not found. The latest comment from ajsutton confirms that this functionality now works correctly in the super node trace provider. It was noted that a fix for op-supervisor is not needed as it is being deleted, but the issue will remain open until an integration test confirms op-challenger and op-program alignment. Previously, Inphi identified this as a real problem, noting that op-program transitions to an invalid hash with insufficient data and questioning the correctness of a specific test.
