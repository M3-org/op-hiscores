# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Sep 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's activity focused on closing several issues related to `min-base-fee` implementation and addressing a large genesis file panic in `op-geth`. Discussions also continued on making Superchain configurations fully explicit.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `min-base-fee` Implementation Issues Closed
Several issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature were closed, indicating progress in its integration. These include adding `minBaseFee` to the block header's `extraData` field [#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/649), adding an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3` [#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/650), and updating `eip1559.CalcBaseFee` to enforce the minimum when the feature is active [#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/651). All closures were linked to the `op-geth` pull request [#666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/666).

### `op-nat` Kurtosis Integration Deprioritized
The issue concerning running `op-nat` in Kurtosis [#158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/158) was closed, with the rationale that other local devnet environments are now being prioritized.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Large Genesis File Panic in `op-geth`
Discussion continued on an issue where `op-geth` panics when initialized with a large genesis file [#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/668). The latest comment from @protolambda suggests modifying `op-geth` for a one-time state import by not storing the alloc data as a flat JSON blob and including the `stateHash` attribute in the chain-`config` part of `genesis.json`. This approach aligns with how `op-mainnet` handles large genesis states, enabling fresh nodes to snap-sync from bootstrap nodes.

### Superchain Configuration Explicitness
An ongoing discussion revolves around making Superchain chain configurations fully explicit [#763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/763). The latest comment from @alfonso-op questions whether chain configs are already self-descriptive and if the issue can be closed.
