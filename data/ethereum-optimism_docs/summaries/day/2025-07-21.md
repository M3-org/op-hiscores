## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-supervisor,op-node: Improve reset unsafe target ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16314))
The discussion on improving the `op-supervisor` and `op-node` reset unsafe target functionality indicates that most actionable items have been covered, particularly with work done in a related pull request. The issue is being considered for closure, especially given upcoming refactoring of these components. The current implementation partially addresses the need for the supervisor to provide correct reset targets, but still lacks handling for pre- and post-Interop scenarios where the supervisor's logs database differs.
