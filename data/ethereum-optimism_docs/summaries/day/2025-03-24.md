## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Documentation for OP Stack Rollup Testnet Creation [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1530)
The discussion on this newly opened issue highlights the current challenges with existing documentation, which mixes old manual deployment methods with the new `op-deployer` approach, making it difficult for external chain operators to launch their chains. There's also a question about `op-deployer` defaulting to FaultDisputeGame instead of L2OO. A user noted a high number of RPC calls on Alchemy when using the permissioned fault-proof system, primarily `eth_call` requests targeting Permissioned Dispute Game contracts, suggesting the challenger might be contributing to the high RPC load. Another comment clarifies that `op-deployer` currently only deploys the permissioned dispute game (game type 1) with a placeholder for the absolute prestate hash, creating a circular dependency. A related pull request ([#1539](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1539)) is in progress to detail these aspects.
