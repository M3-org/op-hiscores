### Congestion-based Builder Transaction Reordering Discussion
The discussion on issue [#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/306), concerning congestion-based builder transaction reordering, saw a new comment from @moonfury-ops. The comment, posted at 2025-07-29T20:33:56Z, expressed interest in collaborating on the issue with @sebastianst. This issue proposes designing a system to track data availability usage excess over time, applying an exponential cost/score penalty, and suggests that this could be implemented outside the protocol to test the idea for an L1 congestion cost component.
