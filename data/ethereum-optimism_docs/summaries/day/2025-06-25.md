# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Jun 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's activity focused on documentation cleanup, specifically removing outdated devnet information. Several issues related to flashblocks, CI/CD, and developer tooling were closed, indicating progress in these areas.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Documentation Cleanup**: Outdated devnet information was removed from the `pages/interop` section of the documentation, streamlining the content for current tools and configurations. ([#1670](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1670))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Flashblocks Implementation & Testing**: Several issues related to the implementation and acceptance testing of flashblocks were closed, indicating successful integration and validation of this feature. This includes enabling flashblocks on `eris-0` and developing acceptance tests for transactions. ([#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16468), [#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/354))
*   **Developer Tooling Enhancements**: Progress was made on developer tooling, with an issue related to modifying predeploys in Supersim being closed. This improves the ability for developers to test future predeploy changes. ([#393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/393))
*   **CI/CD Process Review**: An issue exploring the adoption of internal SLAs for the continuous integration pipeline was closed, with the decision not to implement CI SLAs for now. ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16437))
*   **Documentation Link Fix**: A broken link in the documentation for `L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol` was resolved. ([#283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/283))

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Batcher Memory Optimization**: Discussions on [#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16537) indicate that the `op-batcher` is experiencing memory spikes, particularly during L1 congestion. Initial profiling with `pprof` suggests the compressor is the primary source of memory usage. Proposed optimizations include making the shadow compressor more memory-efficient and eagerly discarding the compressor after channel submission.
*   **Batcher Observability**: Issue [#16572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16572) focuses on increasing the observability of `op-batcher` memory consumption. Key points include integrating `pprof` into Kurtosis devnet and adding CI tests to measure memory usage. Existing benchmarks for channel compressors are being reviewed to ensure they are up-to-date and run effectively in CI.
*   **Withdrawal Pathways for Superchain Output Roots**: Issue [#821](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/821) highlights the need to update `viem`'s withdrawal code to support the Superchain's new output roots structure after the interop hard fork. The team is confirming if testing can be done against RC Beta to prioritize the necessary updates before Sepolia.
*   **Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet**: Discussion on [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/399) clarifies that Supersim is a lighter, Anvil-based local development tool primarily for testing multi-chain/interop applications, while Kurtosis is used by OP Stack for chain testing. Supersim is designed for dApp developers to test upcoming features like interop.
