## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node EL Sync Mode Issue
Discussion continues on [#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18468), where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart when Reth already has synced data. Users are reporting similar issues, with one user suggesting a temporary fix by changing the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restarting `op-node`. This issue is blocking Base Mainnet nodes configured for execution layer syncing.
