### State Dumping Query
A new comment was added to [#390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/390), an issue concerning how to dump all state of addresses. The user "0xWilliamWang" inquired if a solution has been found for exporting all addresses, similar to `alloc` in `genesis.json`, as the `dump` command was not exporting all addresses.
