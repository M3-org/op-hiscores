## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-test-sequencer` Integration Deprioritized
The issue concerning the addition of `op-test-sequencer` to the devnet environment and Kurtosis was closed ([#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15265)). The decision to close was based on a strategic shift away from Kurtosis.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-test-sequencer` Integration ([#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15265))
The issue, which aimed to integrate `op-test-sequencer` into the devnet environment and Kurtosis, was closed today. The latest comment from janjakubnanista confirms the closure, stating, "Closing since we are moving away from `kurtosis`." This follows earlier discussions about the necessity of this integration for reorg tests and a previous deprioritization by teddyknox, which was later re-opened by ajsutton due to a pending todo in the code.

### ChainConfig.BlobConfig Default Behavior ([#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/685))
This newly opened issue highlights that `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` was always using default configurations instead of the actual config contents. However, geoknee's immediate comment indicates that this issue has already been fixed upstream in `ethereum/go-ethereum` ([#32579](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/32579)) and should be resolved with the next upstream merge.
