# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Nov 7, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes related to node operator documentation and updates to release notices. Key issues regarding flaky tests and batcher configurations were also addressed and closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Link Fixes
*   Fixed broken links to node troubleshooting and monitoring guides within the node operator documentation, improving accessibility for users seeking support ([#1855](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1855)).

### Release Notice Updates
*   Updated release notices for `op-reth` to version `v1.9.1` ([#1856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1856)).
*   Added Kona releases to the notices ([#1853](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1853)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   A new pull request, [#1854](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1854), was opened to address an issue where "the unclean shutdown is invisible" in node troubleshooting.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flaky Test Resolution
*   The `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` flaky test issue ([#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17548)) was closed as it is no longer appearing in the top 100 flaky tests, indicating a resolution.

### Batcher Configuration Clarification
*   The issue regarding `op-batcher` not limiting max frame size to max input size in generic mode ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17796)) was closed, as it was addressed in a previous pull request.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
*   **op-batcher [altda]: should not limit max frame size to max input size in generic mode** ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17796)): This issue, though closed today, had recent discussion. The latest comment from `nuke-web3` on November 7th, 2025, suggests that the `alt-da` specification might need updating to reflect the changes made, as the current spec still contains a statement that is now false regarding the `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` limit. This highlights a potential need for documentation synchronization with code changes.
