# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Nov 7, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes related to node operator documentation and updates to release notices. Key issues regarding flaky tests and batcher configurations were also addressed and closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Link Fixes
*   Fixed broken links to node troubleshooting and monitoring guides within the `node-operators` documentation, improving navigation and usability for node operators ([#1855](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1855)).

### Release Notice Updates
*   Updated release notices for `fusaka-notice.mdx` and `upgrade-17.mdx` to include `op-reth` version 1.9.1 and Kona releases ([#1856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1856), [#1853](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1853)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   A new pull request, [#1854](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1854), was opened to address an issue with the invisibility of unclean shutdowns in node troubleshooting.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flaky Test Resolution
*   The long-standing flaky test `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` in `op-acceptance-tests` was confirmed to be fixed and no longer appearing in the top 100 flaky tests, leading to the closure of the issue ([#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17548)).

### Batcher Configuration Update
*   The issue regarding the `op-batcher` not limiting max frame size to max input size in generic mode for altDA was addressed and closed, following the implementation of the necessary changes ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17796)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
*   **op-batcher [altda]: should not limit max frame size to max input size in generic mode** ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17796)): The issue was confirmed to be addressed by a pull request in the `optimism` repository. A follow-up comment suggested updating the `alt-da` specification to reflect the implemented changes, as the current spec contains a statement that is now false regarding the `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` limit.
