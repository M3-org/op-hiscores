# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Nov 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a critical fix for an incorrect `op-geth` tag in upgrade documentation. Several older issues related to node stability, testing, and state corruption were closed due to age or resolution.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Documentation Accuracy:** A fix was implemented to correct an incorrect `op-geth` tag name in the `upgrade-17.mdx` documentation, ensuring accuracy for upgrade procedures ([#1877](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1877)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Node Stability and Performance:** Several issues concerning `op-node` stability, including thousands of stuck goroutines in p2p.SyncClient/libp2p ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16332)) and state DB corruption after upgrades ([#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/549)), were closed due to age or presumed resolution in newer releases. An issue regarding Engine API status/error return values matching the spec was also closed ([#596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/596)).
*   **Testing Infrastructure Improvements:** An issue to parallelize the "memory-all" job in `op-acceptance-tests` was closed as it is no longer needed ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17525)). A flaky test related to `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` was also closed as it hasn't been observed recently ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17966)).
*   **Deprecated Features and Test Issues:** An issue regarding L2 networks diverging over multiple reorg test runs was closed due to the deprecation of KT ([#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15782)). A flaky test `TestMissingBatchE2E` was also closed ([#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18138)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **`op-devstack`: sysext: fix address book ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15817))**
    The issue was initially closed by `mslipper` due to KT being deprecated. However, `ajsutton` reopened it, noting that there are still several TODOs that need to be addressed. The issue concerns updating hardcoded address keys in the `sysext` address book due to changes in the KT local devnet description.

*   **min-base-fee: conduct simulations which prove effectiveness of the feature ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16958))**
    `mslipper` inquired whether this issue is still relevant. The issue proposes using the Kurtosis devnet, a transaction spamming tool, and batcher throttling to simulate a priority fee auction on L2, testing different minimum base fees to observe their impact on auction duration.

*   **min-base-fee: runbook for low batcher throughput ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16959))**
    `mslipper` questioned the continued relevance of this issue. The issue outlines the need to establish alerting for high `MinBaseFee` settings that could lead to unincluded transactions and to create a runbook for responding to such scenarios.

*   **op-acceptance-test: add back op-reth to jovian kt-devnet ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17475))**
    `mslipper` asked if this issue remains relevant. `geoknee` previously commented that since Kurtosis devnet is deprecated, `op-reth` should instead be integrated into the devstack/sysgo system once it supports the min base fee.

*   **Flaky test: TestBreakTimestampInvariant ([#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18137))**
    `mslipper` provided an example failure link for this flaky test, indicating ongoing investigation into its instability.
