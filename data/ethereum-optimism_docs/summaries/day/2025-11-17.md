# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Nov 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on maintenance, specifically correcting an `op-geth` tag in upgrade documentation and closing several aged or resolved issues across various components, including flaky tests and node stability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Documentation Accuracy for Upgrades**
    *   Corrected an incorrect `op-geth` tag name in the `upgrade-17.mdx` file, ensuring accurate documentation for upgrade procedures. ([#1877](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1877))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Resolution of Flaky Test Cases**
    *   Closed a flaky test related to `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` as it has not been observed recently. ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17966))
    *   Closed the `TestMissingBatchE2E` flaky test, with logs indicating a "transaction indexing is in progress" error. ([#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18138))
    *   Closed the issue regarding parallelizing the "memory-all" job in `op-acceptance-tests` as it is no longer needed. ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17525))

*   **Addressing Node Stability and Data Integrity**
    *   Closed an issue concerning `op-node v1.13.3` experiencing thousands of stuck goroutines, citing age and requesting reopening if the issue persists in later releases. ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16332))
    *   Closed an issue regarding `op-geth` full node state DB corruption after an upgrade path, due to its age and suggesting re-snap-sync as a recovery method. ([#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/549))
    *   Closed an issue to ensure Engine API status/error return values match the spec, also due to its age. ([#596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/596))

*   **Deprecation and Outdated Information Cleanup**
    *   Closed an issue related to `op-devstack: sysext: fix address book` as the KT local devnet description is deprecated. ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15817))
    *   Closed an issue where L2 networks diverged over multiple reorg test runs, citing its age. ([#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15782))

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **`op-node v1.13.3`: thousands of stuck goroutines in p2p.SyncClient / libp2p** ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16332))
    *   The issue, describing `op-node` getting stuck with numerous goroutines after several hours, was closed by `mslipper` due to its age, with a request to reopen if the problem recurs in newer releases. Earlier comments from `rrrengineer` and `Creamers158` confirmed similar observations on `v1.13.3`.

*   **`op-geth` full node state DB corruption after following upgrade path from `v1.101411.8` to `v1.101500.0`** ([#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/549))
    *   The issue was closed by `mslipper` due to its age, suggesting reopening if the problem returns. `protolambda` previously speculated that the problem might stem from too many non-buffer layers in the journal, which could be dropped during a journal-version upgrade, exceeding `geth`'s recovery capabilities. `sebastianst` had acknowledged the issue and suggested re-snap-sync as the fastest recovery method.
