# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the closure of two significant issues related to blob priority fee tracking and a potential bug in op-node sequencer recovery mode. Additionally, two new issues were opened concerning documentation and a bug in artifact extraction.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking
The issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18102) concerning `op-batcher/txmgr: Blob priority fee tracking` was closed. Discussions highlighted that the blob tip oracle is now deployed to production, and the current configuration of `min blob cap` at `4 gwei` is overpaying compared to the oracle's suggestion of `2.51 gwei`. The oracle is currently informational but is expected to be utilized soon.

### Op-Node Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug
The issue [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18350) regarding a `possible bug in op-node sequencer recover mode` was closed. The issue involved a refactoring of the L1 origin code in `op-node` and a fix to prevent errors when the L1 origin is up to tip. The drift issue could not be reproduced, but the fix was implemented.

## NEW ISSUES

### Documentation Issues
Two new issues were opened related to documentation. Issue [#1926](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1926) reports a general "Issue on docs" at a specific path. Issue [#1927](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1927) requests to "[DOCS] Add PR title" with a description template.

### Artifact Extraction Bug
A new bug report, [#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18663), was opened titled "`ExtractFromFile expects 'out/' but should expect 'forge-artifacts/' - breaks self-hosted .tzst artifacts`". The issue describes how `ExtractFromFile()` in `op-deployer/pkg/deployer/artifacts/embedded.go` incorrectly expects an `out/` directory within the tarball, while the `mktar` tool packages artifacts with a `forge-artifacts/` prefix. A contributor suggested using constants instead of copy-pasting text for a better solution.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking
In issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18102), the latest comment from `nonsense` on December 19, 2025, at 16:07:54Z, confirms the deployment of the blob tip oracle to production. It notes that the current `min blob cap` of `4 gwei` is leading to overpayment, as the oracle suggests a lower priority fee of `2.51 gwei`. The `op-batcher` logs a warning about the suggested `blobTipCap` being lower than the configured minimum. While currently informational, the oracle's data is expected to be used soon. Earlier discussions by `sebastianst` and `ajsutton` explored potential solutions like tracking own transactions for fee estimation or decaying the starting priority fee from the previous transaction to improve backlog handling.

### Op-Node Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug
Issue [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18350) saw its latest comment from `geoknee` on December 19, 2025, at 16:31:08Z, stating that the drift issue could not be reproduced. However, the L1 origin code in `op-node` was refactored, and a similar fix was adopted to avoid errors when the L1 origin is up to tip, referencing a pull request. The issue was closed with the possibility of reopening if the drift reoccurs. Previous discussions by `geoknee` and `sebastianst` explored why temporary errors persisted in recover mode and potential fixes to prevent these errors when the sequencer is up to tip. They also discussed the implications of the sequencer requesting a non-existent L1 origin block and how this could violate the sequencer drift rule, leading to derivation stalls.
