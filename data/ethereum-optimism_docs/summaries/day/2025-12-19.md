## CLOSED ISSUES

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking
The issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18102) regarding `op-batcher/txmgr: Blob priority fee tracking` was closed. Discussions highlighted that the blob tip oracle is now deployed to production, and the current configuration of `min blob cap` at `4 gwei` is leading to overpayment, as the oracle suggests a lower priority fee of approximately `2.51 gwei`. While the oracle is currently informational, its use is anticipated soon.

### Op-node Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug
The issue [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18350) concerning a "possible bug in op-node sequencer recover mode" was closed. The issue involved a scenario where recover mode was enabled on the sequencer during normal operation, leading to specific log entries on verifier nodes. The resolution involved refactoring the L1 origin code in `op-node` and adopting a fix to prevent errors when the L1 origin is up to tip, as detailed in a related pull request. The issue may be reopened if the drift problem reoccurs.

## NEW ISSUES

### Documentation Issues
Two new issues were opened today. Issue [#1926](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1926) reports a general "Issue on docs" with a specific path `/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup/create-l2-rollup`. Issue [#1927](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1927) titled "[DOCS] Add PR title" requests the addition of a PR title.

### Artifact Extraction Bug
Issue [#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18663) describes a bug where `ExtractFromFile()` in `op-deployer/pkg/deployer/artifacts/embedded.go` expects an `out/` directory within the tarball, but the `mktar` tool packages artifacts with a `forge-artifacts/` prefix, causing self-hosted `.tzst` artifacts to break. A potential fix involving using constants instead of copy-pasting text for `.Join` functions was suggested.
