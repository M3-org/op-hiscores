## CLOSED ISSUES

### Monthly Metrics Reports
Two metrics reports for September 2025 were closed today, detailing performance for closed issues ([#1777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1777)) and opened pull requests ([#1778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1778)).

### Flashblocks Issue Resolution
An issue concerning the loss of Flashblocks when forwarding from `rollup-boost` to RPC nodes was closed, with the resolution attributed to new upgrades of `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` with `rollup-boost` ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17856)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-dispute-mon Node Synchronization
Discussion continued on an issue regarding `op-dispute-mon`'s handling of out-of-sync nodes ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17814)). The latest comments indicate that a proposed solution (PR #17819) will reduce the problem to specific error scenarios. There's an ongoing debate about whether to trust the highest L2 block or to use `syncStatus` to determine node synchronization, with a suggestion to ignore results from behind nodes. The issue was briefly closed by mistake and then reopened.

### Flashblocks RPC Coordination
An issue concerning coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers for a new Flashblocks RPC node ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17857)) was active. The latest update indicates that most providers have proceeded, with Blockscout acknowledging to complete it later in the week.
