# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Nov 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on expanding documentation for the Actions SDK and updating notices related to the Jovian upgrade. A minor bug fix was also implemented to improve navigation within the base fee guide.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Actions SDK Documentation
Significant progress was made in documenting the Actions SDK, with new reference pages added for configuring actions, integrating wallets, and detailing the Wallet and Lend APIs. This greatly expands on the existing Quickstart guide, providing more comprehensive resources for developers utilizing the SDK. ([#1857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1857))

### Jovian Upgrade Notices and Documentation
New release notices for the Jovian upgrade were added, including updates to archived upgrade notices and a new notice specifically for Fusaka. This ensures that users have access to the latest information regarding network upgrades. ([#1860](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1860))

### Documentation Bug Fixes
A minor but important fix was implemented to add a link to the Jovian notice page within the minimum base fee guide, improving the discoverability of relevant upgrade information for chain operators. ([#1859](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1859))

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Jovian Action Test Verification
The issue concerning ensuring Kona had passing action tests for Jovian was closed. It was confirmed that Jovian action tests were added in `op-e2e/actions/proofs` and are being run by Kona in their CI. ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17303))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Optimizing Safe-Head Advancement FCU Messages
Discussion continues on optimizing the `op-node` to send a single aggregate safe-head advancement FCU message per channel instead of multiple. The latest comment from `teddyknox` suggests that a recently merged PR ([#18234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18234)) might help address this issue. Earlier discussions highlighted the problem of "FCU spam" when the batcher runs with a considerable `--max-channel-duration`, leading to numerous FCU calls that can be slow, especially when the Execution Layer (EL) is not local. There was also a question about why `no_tx_pool` flag isn't set for these rapid FCU calls. ([#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15393))

### Documenting `cannonKonaPrestate` Requirement for Upgrades
The discussion around documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades is ongoing. `Inphi` noted that after discussions with devrel, it's agreed that this requirement should be highlighted in the Optimism docs, especially as it's a concern for the U18 upgrade. They plan to update the issue once the documentation is set up. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18095))

### Improving Batcher Update Safeguards on SystemConfig
The issue of improving safeguards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig was opened recently. `geoknee` noted that this issue is somewhat related to or similar to another existing issue ([#17490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17490)). The problem description indicates a need for better protection during batcher updates. ([#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18246))
