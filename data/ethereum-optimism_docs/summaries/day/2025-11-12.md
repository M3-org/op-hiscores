# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Nov 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on expanding documentation for the Actions SDK and updating notices related to the Jovian upgrade. A minor bug fix was also implemented to improve navigation within the base fee guide.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Actions SDK Documentation
Significant progress was made in documenting the Actions SDK, with new reference pages added for configuring actions, integrating wallets, and detailing the Wallet and Lend APIs. This greatly expands on the existing Quickstart guide, providing more comprehensive resources for developers utilizing the SDK. ([#1857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1857))

### Jovian Upgrade Notices and Documentation
New release notices for the Jovian upgrade were added, including updates to archived upgrade notices and a new notice specifically for Fusaka. This ensures that users have access to the latest information regarding network upgrades. ([#1860](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1860))

### Documentation Bug Fixes
A minor but important fix was implemented to add a link to the Jovian notice page within the minimum base fee guide, improving the discoverability of relevant upgrade information for chain operators. ([#1859](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1859))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Jovian Action Test Verification
The issue concerning ensuring Kona has passing action tests for Jovian was closed. It was confirmed that Jovian action tests have been added to `op-e2e/actions/proofs` and are being run by Kona's CI, addressing the initial concern. ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17303))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Optimizing `op-node` Safe-Head Advancement
Discussions continued on optimizing the `op-node`'s safe-head advancement mechanism to reduce the number of `FCU` (Fork Choice Update) messages sent to the Execution Layer (EL). The latest comment from `teddyknox` indicates that a related pull request ([#18234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18234)) was merged today, which may help address the issue. Earlier comments highlighted the problem of "FCU spam" when the `batcher` runs with a considerable `--max-channel-duration`, leading to numerous `FCU` calls. Solutions proposed include sending only one `FCU` per span batch in the happy-path and potentially adding a debounce to the engine-controller `FCU` code. ([#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15393))

### Documenting `cannonKonaPrestate` Requirement for Upgrades
The discussion around documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades is ongoing. `Inphi` noted that after discussions with devrel, it's agreed that this requirement should be highlighted in the Optimism docs, especially as it's a concern for the U18 upgrade. An update will follow once the documentation is set up. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18095))

### Improving Batcher Safeguards on SystemConfig Updates
The issue of improving safeguards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig was raised. `geoknee` pointed out a related issue ([#17490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17490)), suggesting a similar problem or area of concern. The issue aims to enhance the robustness and safety of batcher updates. ([#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18246))
