## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No completed work was reported for this period.
 
## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Documentation Restructuring:** Two new pull requests were opened to address the organization and structure of the documentation. These include [#1792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1792) for "Restructure clone" and [#1791](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1791) for "IA restructure."

## CLOSED ISSUES

- **DA Footprint Limit Testing:** Two issues related to the DA Footprint Limit were closed. [#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17278) focused on writing acceptance tests, which was resolved via a pull request in the `optimism` repository. Similarly, [#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17395), concerning the addition of unit tests for the DA Footprint Limit, was closed via a pull request in `op-geth`.
- **Sequencer Configuration Adjustment:** Issue [#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17683), which aimed to demote and lighten `op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1` on Sepolia, was closed. The resolution involved removing `prod-sepolia-op-opn-geth-f-sunnyseq-1` instead, as detailed in a commit to the `k8s` repository.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **op-conductor Sequencer Startup Failure:** Issue [#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17899) reports a problem where `op-conductor` fails to start the sequencer with an "no unsafe head" error after linking. The issue was opened today, and a user has requested assistance.
- **Jovian Operator Fee Saturating Math:** Issue [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17888) discusses revisiting a saturating math issue in the `operatorFee` getter. The latest comment suggests that an analysis might indicate no need for saturating math in this context.
