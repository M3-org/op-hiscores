# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Oct 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant activity in documentation restructuring with two new pull requests. Several issues related to DA Footprint Limit and sequencer configuration were closed, indicating progress in these areas. An active discussion is ongoing regarding saturating math in operator fee calculations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- Two new pull requests were opened today focusing on documentation restructuring: [#1792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1792) "Restructure clone" and [#1791](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1791) "IA restructure".

## CLOSED ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Testing
Two issues related to the DA Footprint Limit were closed. [#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17278) "[DA Footprint Limit] Write acceptance test" was closed via a pull request in the `optimism` repository. Similarly, [#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17395) "[DA Footprint Limit] add unit tests" was closed via a pull request in the `op-geth` repository, which aimed to build a block with a fixed DA footprint and vary `da_footprint_gas_scalar` to ensure `gasUsed` changes.

### Sequencer Configuration Adjustment
The issue [#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17683) "demote and lighten op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1 of sepolia" was closed. The resolution involved not lightening `op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1` but instead removing `prod-sepolia-op-opn-geth-f-sunnyseq-1` from the voter set, as indicated by a commit in the `k8s` repository.

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Operator Fee Calculation Review
Discussion continues on [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17888) "jovian/operator-fee/GPO: revisit saturating math issue in operatorFee getter". The latest comment suggests that a recent analysis might imply no need for any saturating math in the operator fee calculation.

### op-conductor Sequencer Startup Failure
Issue [#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17899) "op-conductor :Failed to start sequencer, err="no unsafe head"" describes a problem where a sequencer, after being linked to a conductor, fails to start with an "no unsafe head" error. A user has requested assistance with this issue.
