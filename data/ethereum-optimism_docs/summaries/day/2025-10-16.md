## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No completed work was reported for this period.
 
## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Documentation Restructuring:** Two new pull requests were opened to address the organization of documentation. [#1792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1792) focuses on a "Restructure clone," while [#1791](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1791) proposes an "IA restructure."

## CLOSED ISSUES

- **DA Footprint Limit Implementation:** Two issues related to the DA Footprint Limit were closed. [#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17278), concerning writing an acceptance test, was closed via a pull request in the `optimism` repository. Similarly, [#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17395), which aimed to add unit tests for the DA Footprint Limit in `op-geth`, was closed via a pull request in the `op-geth` repository.
- **Sequencer Configuration Adjustment:** Issue [#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17683), regarding the demotion and lightening of `op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1` on Sepolia, was closed. The resolution involved keeping the sequencer in the Sepolia voter set and instead removing `prod-sepolia-op-opn-geth-f-sunnyseq-1`, as detailed in a commit to the `k8s` repository.

## NEW ISSUES

No new issues were reported for this period.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **op-conductor Sequencer Startup Failure:** Issue [#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17899) reports a "Failed to start sequencer, err="no unsafe head"" error after linking `op-conductor` to a previously deployed sequencer. The user `wluisw` has requested assistance from `@zhwrd` to resolve this.
- **Jovian Operator Fee Saturating Math:** Issue [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17888) discusses whether to use saturating math for the `operatorFee` getter to prevent overflows. `geoknee` commented that recent analysis might suggest no need for saturating math, referencing a discussion in a `design-docs` pull request.
