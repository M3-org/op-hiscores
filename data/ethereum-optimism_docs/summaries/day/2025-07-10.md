### Interoperability Prestate Checks
The issue regarding checking the L2 genesis state for pre-interop CrossL2Inbox configuration faults ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15765)) was closed. The discussion concluded that the execution client is not the ideal place for this validation, and the risk has been mitigated through improvements in the genesis generation tooling (op-deployer).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Interop: check EL prestate for pre-interop CrossL2Inbox configuration fault ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15765))
This issue was closed today. The latest comment from ajsutton at 2025-07-10T03:03:24Z stated that the issue is being closed as the execution client is not well-suited for this check, and the risk has been sufficiently mitigated by improvements in the genesis generation tooling. Previous discussions highlighted that `op-deployer` now automatically handles the inclusion of `CrossL2Inbox` based on the number of chains, ensuring correct genesis generation and reducing the need for this validation within the execution client itself.
