Several issues related to the `op-challenger` and ZK game types were closed, indicating progress in integrating ZK proof capabilities. This includes decisions on which service should generate ZK proofs ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18319)), support for challenging ZK game types ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18321)), and improvements to test coverage ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18427)).

### Challenger Configuration Refinements
Issues concerning the `op-challenger`'s ability to read from the DGF registry ([#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18412)), fetch challenger bonds from game arguments ([#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18413)), reload bond values ([#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18414)), and support challenger address changes ([#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18415)) were all closed.

## NEW ISSUES

### Devnet Deployment Warnings
A new issue was reported concerning warnings in `op-node` when deploying a devnet using the `create-l2-rollup-example` script ([#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1898)). The warning message indicates a failure to publish a newly created block.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node` EL Sync Mode Stuck After Restart
Discussion continues on an issue where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart when Reth already has synced data ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18468)). A new comment confirms that another user is experiencing the same issue, which is blocking their Base Mainnet node.

### Unused OP Constants
A discussion is ongoing regarding the presence of unused OP constants in the codebase ([#13440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/13440)). A recent comment suggests that the issue might already be resolved and asks if it can be closed.

### Fusaka-on-L2 Acceptance Tests
The plan to write acceptance tests for new EIPs for Fusaka-on-L2 is being discussed ([#18221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18221)). A recent comment suggests adding acceptance tests to ensure that features not included in Fusaka-on-L2 are properly disabled on OP chains.
