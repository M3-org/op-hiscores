# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Dec 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant activity in addressing and closing several issues related to the `op-challenger` and ZK proof generation, alongside discussions on existing issues concerning `op-node` synchronization and EIP acceptance tests.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### ZK Challenger Development Refinement
Several issues related to the `op-challenger` and its integration with ZK games were closed. This includes decisions on which service should generate ZK proofs, with the succinct proposer being chosen for its rust stack compatibility and SPN interaction capabilities ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18319)). Additionally, support for challenging ZK game types was marked as done, with further acceptance tests planned to cover this functionality ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18321)).

### Challenger Configuration and Bond Handling
Multiple issues concerning the `op-challenger`'s configuration, such as improving test coverage, reading from the DGF registry, fetching challenger bonds from game arguments, reloading bond values, and supporting challenger address changes, were closed. These were resolved with the decision to use `op-challenger` for ZK games, as it already handles these functionalities ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18427), [#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18412), [#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18413), [#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18414), [#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18415)).

## NEW ISSUES
### Devnet Deployment Warnings
A new issue was reported regarding warnings in `op-node` when deploying a devnet using the `create-l2-rollup-example` script, specifically concerning failed block publishing ([#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1898)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-node` EL Sync Mode Stuck
Discussion continued on an issue where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart, even when Reth has synced data ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18468)). A user confirmed experiencing the same issue, blocking their Base Mainnet node, and a temporary fix was suggested: changing the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restarting `op-node`.

### Unused OP Constants
A comment was added to an issue discussing unused OP constants, suggesting that the issue might already be resolved and could potentially be closed ([#13440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/13440)).

### Fusaka-on-L2 Acceptance Tests
A new comment on the issue for writing acceptance tests for new EIPs for fusaka-on-l2 suggested that additional acceptance tests might be added to ensure features not included in fusaka-on-l2 are properly disabled on OP chains ([#18221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18221)).
