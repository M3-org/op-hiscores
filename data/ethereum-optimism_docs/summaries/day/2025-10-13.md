### Monitoring and Alerting for Replica-Healthchecks
Discussion continued on [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17686) regarding graceful monitoring and alerting of multiple replica-healthchecks per namespace. A user, CreeptoGengar, submitted a pull request with the intention of solving the issue. However, yashvardhan-kukreja clarified that the issue is out of the scope of op-conductor and is meant to be implemented on the infra end, hence its "blocked" status and association with the Platforms Team Tracker. The pull request was subsequently closed, with yashvardhan-kukreja encouraging future contributions after discussing with a maintainer and getting the issue assigned.
