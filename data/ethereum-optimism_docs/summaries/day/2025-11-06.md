## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Compatibility with Go 1.25
Discussions on [#17060] continue regarding Cannon's compatibility with Go 1.25. The latest comments confirm that the issue, which causes incorrect Keccak hashes and potentially other crypto problems, has been fixed in Go 1.25.4. Previously, it was noted that Go 1.25.1 did not include the necessary MIPS fix.

### op-batcher and AltDA Frame Size
Issue [#17796] discusses whether `op-batcher` should limit the max frame size to the max input size in generic mode for altDA. The latest comment from nuke-web3 suggests updating the spec to reflect that the previous statement regarding `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` is now false, indicating a need for spec clarification. tessr confirmed that the issue was addressed in a previous pull request.

### op-sync-tester Support for Jovian
The issue [#18126] focuses on patching Sync Tester to support Jovian and adding Jovian HF tests. CreeptoGengar has submitted a pull request that is expected to resolve this issue.

### op-batcher Synchronization with op-node Rollup Config
Discussions on [#18178] revolve around the `op-batcher`'s initial fetching of the rollup config from `op-node` and its lack of subsequent updates. joshklop suggested making the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher to make the dependency clear. sebastianst agreed, noting that this pragmatic solution would ensure consistent rollup config within the batcher, though it might require a new batcher release for each Superchain Registry config change.
