## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation for New Features and Guides
*   Added documentation for the operator fee vault, detailing its integration into contract addresses introduced in Isthmus, impacting various SuperSim chain environments and smart contract concepts ([#1741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1741)).
*   Introduced a new guide for setting the minimum base fee, providing essential instructions for chain operators ([#1849](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1849)).

### Documentation Maintenance and Enhancements
*   Fixed numerous broken links across various sections of the documentation, improving navigation and accessibility for app developers, chain operators, and node operators ([#1850](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1850)).
*   Updated execution and consensus configuration documentation for node operators, addressing a previously closed issue ([#1823](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1823)).
*   Updated notice pages for communications, specifically for the Fusaka Defense and Upgrade 17, and clarified upgrade execution details for the Jovian hard fork, including the Optimism Security Council's role ([#1847](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1847), [#1852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1852)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#1851](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1851) docs(node): restruct the snap sync: This PR aims to restructure the snap sync documentation for nodes.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Configuration and Upgrade Documentation
*   [#1770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1770) Update consensus layer and execution config: This issue, created on September 28, 2025, was closed today after updates to the consensus layer and execution configuration documentation were completed.

### Audit and Compatibility
*   [#17371](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17371) Kona + Cannon: Audit OPCM changes: This issue, created on September 8, 2025, was closed as its scope is now covered by a related issue in the main Optimism repository.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility
*   [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17060) cannon: Support go1.25: The discussion revolves around the compatibility of Cannon with Go 1.25, specifically addressing a bug in Go 1.25 that affects MIPS emulation and leads to incorrect Keccak hashes. It was noted that Go 1.25.1 was released, but it did not include the MIPS fix. The latest comment indicates that the fix is in Go 1.25.4.

### Op-Batcher Frame Size and Rollup Config Sync
*   [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17796) op-batcher [altda]: should not limit max frame size to max input size in generic mode: This issue discusses exempting `op-batcher` max frame size from altDA max input size limit in generic commitment mode. It was confirmed that this was addressed in a previous pull request, and the issue is being considered for closure.
*   [#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18178) op-batcher: stay in sync with op-node rollup config: The core problem is that `op-batcher` fetches the rollup config only once at startup, leading to potential desynchronization. Solutions discussed include making the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher, which is seen as a pragmatic solution, or implementing a mechanism to reload the config when the active endpoint changes. The current approach of relying on the embedded superchain-registry for known chains is also mentioned.

### Op-Sync-Tester Jovian Support
*   [#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18126) op-sync-tester: Support Jovian: This issue focuses on patching the Sync Tester to support the Jovian hard fork and adding corresponding tests. A pull request has been made to address this issue.
