# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Jun 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on enhancing documentation for chain operators, specifically adding a detailed guide for setting up sequencer nodes. Discussions on active issues revolved around `op-supervisor` behavior during resets and `op-geth` CPU usage.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Operator Documentation Expansion
A significant addition was made to the operator documentation, providing a detailed guide for chain operators on how to set up sequencer nodes for custom OP Stack chains after L1 configuration. This enhances the clarity and completeness of deployment instructions for new chains. ([#1632](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1632))

## NEW ISSUES

### Tutorial Request for Fee Vault Updates
A new tutorial request was opened to guide users on how to update a fee vault, specifically changing its recipient and withdrawal network. This highlights a need for more practical, step-by-step guides for smart contract interactions. ([#1671](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1671))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-supervisor` Reset Behavior and L1 Origin Validity
Discussions continued on improving the `op-supervisor`'s reset target logic and L1 origin validity handling.
- For [#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16314) (Improve reset unsafe target), a comment from July 25th indicates the issue is being closed due to recent project changes, with much of the actionable work completed in a related PR. A comment from June 27th noted partial implementation for supervisor responsibility in providing reset targets, but highlighted remaining gaps in handling pre- and post-Interop scenarios.
- For [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16315) (Improve L1 origin validity handling during resets), a June 27th comment noted that a L1 origin verifier method now exists in the supervisor, used for local unsafe detection, but needs extension to safe heads to fully address the issue's goal of checking L1 origin canonicality during resets.
- For [#16321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16321) (Improve reorg during reset behavior), a June 27th comment stated that while local unsafe head detection now includes L1 origin checks at the supervisor level, other safety levels still lack this validation, linking back to issue [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16315).

### `op-geth` CPU Usage Spikes
The issue of abnormal CPU usage with `op-geth` ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/613)) saw continued discussion.
- A comment from June 28th provided detailed instructions on how to capture `pprof` data for `op-geth` to diagnose CPU consumption.
- Another comment from June 28th suggested that high CPU usage might be temporary due to log indexing rebuilds in the latest `op-geth` version, with CPU returning to normal after completion.
- A June 27th comment from `jsvisa` reiterated that the high CPU usage is likely temporary due to log indexing rebuilds, as the latest `op-geth` version backported changes from `go-ethereum` that involve this process.
- A June 27th comment from `cpuchainorg` contrasted `op-geth`'s 50% CPU usage with `go-ethereum`'s lower usage, suggesting a potential bug in the backporting process.

### `op-supervisor` Event Spikes
An investigation into spikes of `local-derived` and other events in `op-supervisor` ([#16603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16603)) was initiated. A June 27th comment speculated that the issue might be related to `ChainsDB` or `GlobalSyncExec` deadlocks, awaiting a full panic stack trace for confirmation.

### `op-chain-ops` Broken Dependency
A new issue was opened regarding a broken dependency in `op-chain-ops` related to `github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39` ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16612)). A June 27th comment clarified that `cosmos/go-bip39` is a fork, but `op-chain-ops` uses a newer version (`v1.1.0`) than the fork's latest (`v1.0.0`), indicating a potential version mismatch or refactoring issue.
