# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the documentation saw an update to correct a directory reference within the L2 rollup creation guide. Discussions continued on several active issues, including flashblock support in `sysgo`, `proxyd`'s handling of out-of-sync backends, and blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Corrections
A pull request was merged to fix an incorrect directory reference in the `create-l2-rollup` documentation, ensuring accuracy for users setting up L2 rollups ([#1822](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1822)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblock Support in `op-acceptance-tests`
Discussion on [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16450) highlighted the need for `sysgo` to support flashblocks and builders to enable related test cases. A recent comment from teddyknox indicated this is desired to validate changes related to `kona-node` and `rollup-boost`.

### `proxyd` Backend Synchronization Issues
Issue [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/501) continues to address `proxyd`'s "backwards time travel" problem when backends are out of sync. Recent comments from joshklop and yashvardhan-kukreja explored various approaches, including a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, silent fallbacks on "block out of range" errors, and IP-based or signature-based sticky sessions. The trade-offs between reliability, implementation complexity, and performance impact were discussed, with a preference for simpler, drop-in fixes if traffic allows.

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr`
On issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18102), the conversation focused on improving blob priority fee estimation. sebastianst responded to a suggestion about decaying priority fees, noting that while it could help with backlogs, a dedicated blob priority fee tracker would provide better estimates from startup, despite being a larger implementation effort.
