## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on addressing existing issues, particularly around `proxyd`'s handling of out-of-sync backends and `op-batcher/txmgr`'s blob priority fee tracking. A new pull request was opened to add configuration sections for `minBaseFee` and `DA Footprint`.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Proxyd Backend Synchronization Challenges**: Discussions on [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/501) explored various approaches to prevent "backwards time travel" in `proxyd` when backends are out of sync. Suggestions included a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, silent fallbacks on "block out of range" errors, and IP-based or signature-based sticky sessions. Concerns were raised about the impact of "backwards time travel" on `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory`.

- **Blob Priority Fee Tracking in op-batcher/txmgr**: Issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18102) continues to discuss the need for improved blob priority fee tracking. The latest comments explored the possibility of the batcher's priority fee "decaying" from previous transactions as a potential quick win, though it was noted that a dedicated blob priority fee tracker would provide a more robust solution, especially after restarts.

- **Update `migrate` method**: Discussion on [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17743) clarified that this issue specifically tracks OPCM changes, with devstack changes being covered in a separate issue. The latest comment suggests this issue might be ready for closure.
