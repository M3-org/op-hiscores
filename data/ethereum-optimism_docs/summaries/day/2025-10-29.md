## ACTIVE ISSUES

### L1 Chain Configuration for L3s
Discussion on [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18070) explored the ability for `op-node` and `op-program` to skip L1 chain configuration for L3s, especially when the L1 chain ID is a known L2 chain ID. The latest comment suggests automatically applying L3 behavior in such cases, similar to how L1 mainnet and Sepolia are recognized.

### `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` Marshaling
Issue [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17907) continues to address the problem of new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` breaking zk stacks due to changes in commitment hashing. A new field, `daFootprintGasScalar`, has caused further breakage. The discussion highlights the need for versioning or better expectations for RPC method bodies, as third-party integrations are affected. A new Kona release for Jovian is now available, which might help address some of these issues.

### Race Conditions in `op-devstack`
The discussion on [#18063](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18063) revolves around resolving race conditions arising from `dsl.EOA` abuse in `op-devstack` acceptance tests. The latest comments emphasize that assuming complete ownership of a `*dsl.EOA` is reasonable and that tests should fund new, unique wallets via faucets to ensure isolation and prevent nonce and balance issues. The idea of a "custom test runner" and `op-acceptor` for managing wallet objects and test preconditions is also being explored.
