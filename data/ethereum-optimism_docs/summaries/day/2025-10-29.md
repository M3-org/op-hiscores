## ACTIVE ISSUES

### L1 Chain Config for L3s
Discussion on [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18070) centered on the need for `op-node` and `op-program` to skip L1 chain config for L3s. The latest comment from ajsutton suggests automatically detecting known L2 chain IDs to apply L3 behavior, similar to how Mainnet and Sepolia are recognized. Sebastianst agreed, emphasizing that this would simplify the process for most L3s.

### Resolving Race Conditions in `op-devstack`
Issue [#18063](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18063) addresses race conditions arising from `dsl.EOA` abuse in `op-devstack`. ajsutton commented that assuming complete ownership of `*dsl.EOA` is reasonable and suggested using faucets to fund new, unique wallets for tests to ensure isolation. joshklop acknowledged that the idea of a custom test runner might not be as powerful as initially thought for parallelization, and clarified that `op-acceptor` wraps the go test runner, which prevents EOA synchronization across packages. pcw109550 noted that some tests cannot be parallelized by nature and suggested that `op-acceptor` could potentially manage external wallet objects for tests.

### Marshaling New Fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig`
The discussion on [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17907) highlights a breaking change for zk stacks due to new fields being marshaled in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig`. fakedev9999 announced a Jovian-ready release for Kona. emiliano-conduitxyz reported a new occurrence of the issue with `daFootprintGasScalar`, emphasizing the need for versioning or better expectations for RPC method bodies due to third-party integrations. geoknee mentioned checking with emilianobonassi about a potential solution, while tynes questioned if updating `op-succinct/kailua` would be a better approach than adding a nullable system config.
