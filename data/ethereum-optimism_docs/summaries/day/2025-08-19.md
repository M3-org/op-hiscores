# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Aug 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on documentation enhancements, specifically refactoring OP-Challenger docs and updating faucet links. Several audit-related and metric report issues were closed, and new PRs and issues were opened, indicating ongoing development and maintenance.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Refinement for Operators
Significant updates were made to the operator documentation, particularly for `op-challenger`. This involved a comprehensive refactor and link updates across multiple files related to chain operators and fault proofs, improving clarity and accuracy for those deploying and managing Optimism infrastructure. ([#1702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1702))

### Developer Tooling Documentation Improvements
The documentation for developer tools saw an update to the `faucets.mdx` file. This included adding a new faucet link for Sepolia and reordering existing faucet lists alphabetically to enhance consistency and user experience for app developers. ([#1703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1703))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#1718](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1718), was opened today, focusing on a redesign of the documentation homepage.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Monthly Metrics Reporting
Several issues related to monthly metrics reports for July 2025 were closed. These reports provided insights into the average and median times for first responses, issue closure, and answer times for both closed issues ([#1707](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1707)) and opened pull requests ([#1708](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1708)).

### Documentation Audit Follow-ups
An issue related to the 2024 Q4 audit, specifically concerning a page path, was closed ([#1713](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1713)). This indicates progress in addressing findings from the audit.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblocks on Sunnyside Sequencers
Issue [#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16688), concerning the enablement of flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers, was closed today. The latest comment from @parkgunou confirmed that all Sunnyside sequencers for Sepolia are now running with Flashblocks and are connected to the websocket proxy, with failover tested on the `eris-0` devnet. This resolves the challenge of enabling flashblocks on Sunnyside's infrastructure.

### Missing Test Logs in `op-acceptance-tests`
Issue [#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17151) highlights missing test logs in `op-acceptance-tests` despite failed tests in a CI run. @scharissis commented that the "go-tests-short" workflow job is not designed for acceptance tests and that the few sysgo acceptance tests it runs are not processed via `op-acceptor` to capture logs. A PR ([#16755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16755)) is in progress to move these tests, which should resolve the logging issue. @janjakubnanista later confirmed that the logs were found in one of the root logs.

### Outdated Content in 2024 Q4 Audit
Issue [#1673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1673) points to outdated content on a page related to the 2024 Q4 audit, specifically regarding the Movement Network, MOVE token utility, and DAO governance. @krofax requested clarification on the specific page being referred to, indicating a need for more precise information to address the content update.
