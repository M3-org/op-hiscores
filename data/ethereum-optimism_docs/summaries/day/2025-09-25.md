## NEW ISSUES

### Engine API Validation Improvements
*   A new issue was opened to deduplicate Engine API validations in `Miner.prepareWork`, noting that many checks are already performed as part of the Engine API validation in `eth/catalyst/api_optimism.go` ([#688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/688)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Superchain-ops Flow Improvements
Discussion continued on improving the `superchain-ops` flow ([#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1224)). @blmalone provided detailed responses to feedback from @geoknee, addressing several "snags" encountered during the signing flow. Key points included:
*   Clarification on why "TODOs" are printed during task simulation (for task developers to create `VALIDATION.md` files).
*   Acknowledgement that audit reports were an experimental addition and the language around them needs to be changed.
*   Discussion on the necessity of `op-txverify` for some signers.
*   Confirmation that the "normalized state diff hash" explanation should be included.
*   A PR was raised to address some of the identified issues.

### op-batcher preparation for Fusaka
Discussion on preparing `op-batcher` for Fusaka activation continued ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17472)). @geoknee provided a recipe for manual testing against a Fusaka L1, emphasizing the need for the batcher to send blob transactions with cell proofs rather than blob proofs once Fusaka activates.
