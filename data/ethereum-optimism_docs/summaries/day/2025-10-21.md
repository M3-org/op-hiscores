# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Oct 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical infrastructure improvements, including fixing Superchain redirects and a significant restructuring of documentation related to app development, bridging, and tools. Several new pull requests were opened, addressing redirects and draft content, while active issues saw discussions around observability, installation errors, and Fusaka preparations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Restructuring and Organization
A major restructuring effort was completed, reorganizing numerous documentation files across app-developers guides, reference materials, tools, and tutorials. This aims to improve the clarity and accessibility of information for developers building on Optimism.
- Restructured files related to bridging, interoperability, transactions, and Superchain guides.
- Reorganized reference documentation for contracts, networks, RPC providers, and tokens.
- Consolidated and updated documentation for various developer tools, including Supersim, data analytics, and testing utilities.
- Updated tutorial paths for bridging, development, and interoperability.
([#1792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1792))

### Superchain Redirect Fixes
A bug fix was implemented to correct redirects related to the Superchain, ensuring proper navigation within the documentation.
- Fixed incorrect Superchain redirects in `docs.json`.
([#1800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1800))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Redirect and Content Updates**: Two new pull requests were opened to address further redirect issues ([#1801](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1801)) and to add draft content related to actions ([#1799](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1799)).
- **Setup Rollup Fix**: A pull request was opened to fix an issue where `op-program` uses `genesi-l2.json` during setup ([#1798](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1798)).

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed on Oct 21, 2025.

## NEW ISSUES
- **Documentation Path Issue**: A new issue was reported regarding an incorrect path in the `/get-started/interop` documentation, specifically concerning the `op-up/install.sh` script ([#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1797)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Observability in Sysgo**: Discussion continued on enabling observability and monitoring in sysgo for long-running op-stack devnets ([#17941](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17941)). A recent comment suggests this might be a duplicate of an existing issue in the `optimism` repository.
- **Mise Install Error**: An issue regarding an Optimism `mise install` error due to a version prefix "v" was actively discussed ([#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17963)). The latest comment clarifies that this is an issue with the latest version of `mise` and recommends using the install script from the `develop` branch of the `optimism` repository for correct functionality.
- **op-geth Fusaka Preparation**: The task to prepare `op-geth` for Fusaka was discussed, with a recent comment confirming that the Sepolia update is complete but the Mainnet update is still pending ([#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/682)).
- **Superchain-ops Task for Absolute Prestate Update**: Discussions continued on writing a `superchain-ops` task for updating the absolute prestate for Fusaka ([#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1206)). The latest comment confirms that this has been done and executed on Sepolia, with a question raised about keeping the ticket open for the Mainnet task.
