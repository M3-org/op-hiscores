# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Oct 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on significant restructuring of documentation related to app development and bridging, alongside a critical bug fix for Superchain redirects.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Restructuring for App Developers
A major restructuring of documentation was completed, impacting numerous files across app-developers guides, tools, reference, and tutorials. This effort aims to improve the organization and accessibility of content for developers building on Optimism.
- Restructured content across 50+ files related to app development, bridging, and interoperability ([#1792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1792)).

### Superchain Redirect Fix
A bug fix was implemented to correct redirects related to the Superchain, ensuring proper navigation within the documentation.
- Fixed Superchain redirects in `docs.json` ([#1800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1800)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Redirects and Content Drafts:** Three new pull requests were opened, including one to fix redirects ([#1801](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1801)), another for actions draft content ([#1799](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1799)), and a fix for `op-program` using `genesi-l2.json` in `setup-rollup` ([#1798](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1798)).

## CLOSED ISSUES
- No issues were closed on this day.

## NEW ISSUES
### Documentation Path Issue
A new issue was reported concerning a path error in the `/get-started/interop` documentation, specifically related to a `curl` command for installing `op-up` ([#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1797)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Mise Install Error
Discussion on [#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17963) regarding an Optimism `mise install` error due to a version prefix "v" indicates that the issue stems from the latest version of `mise`. The recommended solution is to install `mise` using the script provided in the `optimism` repository's `ops/scripts/install_mise.sh`, which uses a compatible version.

### op-geth Preparation for Fusaka
Issue [#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/682) tracks the preparation of `op-geth` for the Fusaka upgrade. It has been confirmed that the work for Sepolia is complete, but the task remains open for Mainnet.

### Superchain-ops Task for Absolute Prestate Update
Issue [#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1206) concerns the creation of a `superchain-ops` task to update the absolute prestate for Fusaka. This task has been completed and executed on Sepolia. The discussion suggests keeping the ticket open to track the Mainnet task, and a template for drafting the task was previously discussed.
