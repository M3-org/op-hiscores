## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game Creator Pattern Audit
Issue [#17069](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17069) concerns the audit for the Dispute Game Creator Pattern refactor. The latest comment from pauldowman indicates that this is "In progress as part of general U18 audit." Previously, pauldowman requested @stevennevins to add an overview and specific points for auditors in the security readiness document.

### `op deployer` with Custom Intent Reverts
Issue [#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18407) reports that `op deployer` reverts when using custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values. The latest comment from ajsutton suggests that this is likely due to a validation check in `FaultDisputeGame.sol`, requiring `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` to be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration`. The comment also advises against significantly reducing the preimage oracle challenge period or using a very short dispute game clock in production.
