### Dispute Game Creator Pattern Audit
Issue [#17069](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17069) concerns the audit for the Dispute Game Creator Pattern refactor. The latest comment from pauldowman indicates that this is "In progress as part of general U18 audit." Previously, pauldowman requested @stevennevins to add an overview and specific points for auditors in the security readiness document.

### `op deployer` with Custom Intent Reverts
Issue [#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18407) reported that `op deployer` was reverting when using custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values. ajsutton identified the likely cause as a validation in `FaultDisputeGame.sol` requiring `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` to be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration`. InoMurko later confirmed this was the issue, stating they had to override `PreimageOracleChallengePeriod` for testnets.
