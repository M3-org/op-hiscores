# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Sep 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, particularly addressing an upgrade notice. Significant progress was made in closing out several long-standing issues related to documentation updates, audit requirements, and flashblocks implementation, streamlining the project's backlog.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Upgrade Notice Bug Fixes**
    *   Fixed a bug related to the U16a upgrade notice page, ensuring accurate information for users and chain operators ([#1740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1740)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   A new pull request, [#1739](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1739), was opened to fix the U16a notice page by adding chain operator tasks.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Documentation & Audit Updates**
    *   Closed several issues related to outdated documentation and audit requirements, including a suggestion for custom chains in bridging ETH ([#1473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1473)), and audit-related tasks ([#1673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1673), [#1727](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1727)).
*   **Flashblocks Implementation & Monitoring**
    *   Resolved multiple issues concerning the enablement and monitoring of flashblocks on mainnet sequencers, confirming stability and successful deployment ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16759), [#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16760), [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17317)).
    *   Addressed alerting for low peer count health of flashblocks-enabled sequencers ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16868)) and health of non-flashblocks enabled sequencers ([#17143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17143)).
*   **Infrastructure & Metrics Reporting**
    *   Closed issues related to op-conductor deployment with EL p2p healthchecks ([#17153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17153)) and monthly metrics reports for closed issues and opened PRs ([#1730](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1730), [#1731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1731)).
*   **Proof System Smoke Tests**
    *   Closed several smoke test issues for op-challenger, op-dispute-mon, and op-proposer, as they are no longer required ([#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/141), [#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/140), [#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/142), [#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/143)).

## NEW ISSUES

*   **Contract Upgrade Testing**
    *   An issue was opened to add "soneium" to the contract upgrade tests in CI, requiring configuration ([#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17332)).
*   **OP-Program Enhancements**
    *   A new issue proposes adding a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in op-program specifications ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17416)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Websockets Support in Kurtosis Reverse Proxy ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17194))**
    *   The issue was initially closed as "won't implement" but was reopened due to a lingering TODO in the code referencing this feature. The latest comment indicates that the TODO should be removed if the feature is indeed not being implemented, to groom the backlog.
*   **Add soneium to contract upgrade tests ([#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17332))**
    *   A PR has been opened that aims to close this issue, indicating active progress on integrating "soneium" into the contract upgrade tests.
*   **op-program: Add hint for fast block header oracle lookup ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17416))**
    *   A draft PR has been created to address this issue, which aims to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookup. The next step involves validating the information in the PR.
