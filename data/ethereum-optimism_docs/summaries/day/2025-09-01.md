## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#1732](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1732), was opened to remove a dead link from the documentation.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Op-proposer Error Resolution
Issue [#17042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17042), concerning persistent `op-proposer` errors, was closed. The discussion clarified that `GameAlreadyExists` errors are expected if the safe head has not advanced, indicating no new valid proposals. Solutions involve ensuring the batcher is running correctly and potentially shortening its maximum channel duration.

## NEW ISSUES

### Monthly Metrics Reports
Two new issues were opened to track monthly metrics:
- [#1730](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1730) for the August 2025 metrics report on closed issues.
- [#1731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1731) for the August 2025 metrics report on opened pull requests.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Op-dispute-mon Support for Kona + Cannon
Issue [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17286) discusses the need for `op-dispute-mon` to support `cannon-kona` game types. The latest comment from pauldowman indicates a change to "Update to support cannon-kona games." Earlier, ajsutton clarified that `dispute-mon` must return an error for unsupported game types and that arbitrary game types cannot be created without an existing implementation. The core challenge is updating `dispute-mon` to recognize and handle these new game types.
