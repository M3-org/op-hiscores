## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Blocking Acceptance Tests
Issue [#16270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16270) discusses making the `op-acceptance-tests` workflow blocking to prevent merges with failing tests. The latest comment from janjakubnanista confirms that "The tests are now blocking," indicating successful implementation of this feature. Previously, alfonso-op had raised concerns about test runtime and flakiness as prerequisites for making the workflow blocking.

### Reporting Unused Acceptance Tests
Issue [#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16273) aims to discover and report unused acceptance tests. janjakubnanista's latest comment asks @scharissis if this is still a desired feature. Earlier, alfonso-op suggested a "staging" gate for tests that run but don't block merges, to ensure all tests are within a gate.

### Flashblocks Alerting
Issue [#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16867) focuses on creating an alert for when a non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off. zhwrd's latest comment questions the current relevance of the ticket and whether a detection mechanism for disabled flashblocks already exists. jelias2 previously noted that an alert would be created once a specific pull request landed.

### Parallelizing "memory-all" Job
Issue [#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17525) proposes parallelizing the "memory-all" job in `op-acceptance-tests` to avoid increasing CI duration when the workflow becomes blocking. janjakubnanista's latest comment asks @scharissis if this is still needed, as the PR addressing it was autoclosed.

### Tuning Flashblocks WebSocket Proxy Alert
Issue [#17716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17716) concerns tuning the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy-upstream-messages-low` alert on Sepolia. The issue was closed by yashvardhan-kukreja, who stated that the task is completed and `op-conductor` is still not in the flashblocks propagation flow. They noted that troubleshooting progress was made but was deprioritized. zhwrd had previously inquired about the status and `op-conductor`'s presence in the flow.

### Investigating L2 Key Handover Test
Issue [#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/643) is about investigating an L2 key handover test. janjakubnanista's latest comment asks @bitwiseguy if this issue remains relevant after a recent refactor.

### CI: Update `golang-validate-all` Job Summary
Issue [#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/644) aims to improve the `golang-validate-all` CI job by providing a summary of passes/failures. janjakubnanista's latest comment asks @bitwiseguy if this has been addressed by SCR 2.0. jmcoplabs previously moved the issue to the backlog, awaiting a refactor to decouple the golang test framework from the validation core logic.

### Encoding ProxyAdminOwner Exceptions
Issue [#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/675) addresses encoding ProxyAdminOwner exceptions for Base and Unichain, allowing their PAO to be a 3/3 instead of the standard 2/2. janjakubnanista believes this has been addressed with SCR 2.0 and asks @bitwiseguy for confirmation. alfonso-op noted it was blocked on Unichain launch, and bitwiseguy had previously asked for clarifications on the specific addresses and scope of the exception.

### Proxyd Backwards Time Travel
Issue [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/501) describes a scenario where Proxyd can "travel back in time" and return previous blocks if its backends are not in sync. alfonso-op's latest comment links to a related issue with more details.
