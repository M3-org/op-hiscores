## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Updates
* A new notice, "U17 notice," was added to the documentation, impacting `docs.json` and `notices/upgrade-17.mdx` ([#1795](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1795)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
* **Add GoldRush (powered by Covalent) details** ([#1824](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1824)): This pull request aims to integrate information about GoldRush, powered by Covalent, into the documentation.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Registry Enhancements and Refactoring
* Several issues related to the Superchain Registry were closed, indicating significant progress in its refactoring and functionality. This includes improvements to diff tools ([#284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/284)), checking config parameters for each chain ([#294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/294)), and moving L1 RPC URL from superchain init to validation ([#609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/609)).
* Issues concerning the `add-chain` script's ability to handle input variations ([#220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/220)) and a flakey nil pointer dereference during `add-chain` tests ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/635)) were also resolved.

### Test Suite and CI Improvements
* The issue of making the `op-acceptance-tests` workflow blocking was closed, with the tests now preventing merges ([#16270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16270)).
* A CI flake related to the `add-chain` help flag being redefined was closed as the workflow is no longer active and codegen does not flake ([#477](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/477)).

### Contract and Configuration Updates
* Issues related to adding `L2ProxyAdminOwner` to TOML files ([#470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/470)) and supporting Holesky testnets ([#518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/518)) were closed as completed.
* The issue of adding contract implementation addresses to superchain config was closed as addressed ([#520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/520)).
* The overhaul of how fault proofs contract addresses are stored and discovered was closed as fixed by a related issue ([#604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/604)).

### Miscellaneous Closures
* An issue regarding `op-deployer` verification guides was closed as it is no longer a priority ([#17145](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17145)).
* The issue of tuning the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy-upstream-messages-low` alert for Sepolia was closed as completed ([#17716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17716)).
* An issue concerning `op-deployer` logs and Etherscan verification on Sepolia was closed in favor of another issue ([#18089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18089)).
* A UX consideration to add chain names to `addresses.json` was closed due to past issues with breaking changes ([#999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/999)).

## NEW ISSUES
* **Proxyd Time Travel Issue** ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/501)): This new issue describes a scenario where Proxyd can "travel back in time" and return previous blocks as the `unsafe` block if its backends are not in sync. A related issue with more details has been referenced.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Test Suite and CI Improvements
* **[op-acceptance-tests] Report unused tests** ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16273)): The latest comment from janjakubnanista asks if this is still a desired feature, suggesting a re-evaluation of its relevance.
* **[op-acceptance-tests] Parallelise "memory-all" job** ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17525)): janjakubnanista noted that the PR addressing this was autoclosed and questioned if the task is still relevant.
* **ci: update `golang-validate-all` job to give summary of passes/failures** ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/644)): janjakubnanista inquired if this has been addressed by SCR 2.0, indicating a potential resolution through recent refactoring.

### Flashblocks and Monitoring
* **alert when non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off** ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16867)): zhwrd asked for an update on the ticket's relevance and if a detection mechanism for disabled flashblocks is already in place.

### Superchain Registry and Configuration
* **investigate L2 key handover test** ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/643)): janjakubnanista questioned if this issue remains relevant after the recent refactor.
* **encode ProxyAdminOwner exceptions for Base and Unichain** ([#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/675)): janjakubnanista believes this has been addressed with SCR 2.0 and sought confirmation from @bitwiseguy.
