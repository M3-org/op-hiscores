# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Dec 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on documentation improvements, including moving the faucets page, adding a new faucet, and incorporating a missing document. Refactoring efforts streamlined file organization and navigation within the documentation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Structure and Navigation Refinements
The documentation underwent significant structural improvements, with the `faucets` page being relocated and unused files and links cleaned up. This refactoring ensures a more logical and user-friendly navigation experience for developers seeking testing tools. [#1921](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1921)

### Faucet Information Expansion
A new faucet, ethfaucet.com, was added to the documentation, providing developers with an additional resource for obtaining testnet ETH across various Superchain networks. This enhancement directly supports the developer experience by making testing more accessible. [#1917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1917)

### Content Integration and Organization
A previously missing document was integrated into the Superchain information section, enhancing the completeness of the documentation. Additionally, a page was reorganized to improve its accessibility and relevance within the developer guides. [#1923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1923), [#1924](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1924)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#1922](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1922) Za/konaproofs docs: This PR likely introduces new documentation related to Kona proofs.
- [#1920](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1920) Permissionless switch update: This PR suggests an update to documentation concerning a permissionless switch.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona-SP1 Optimization for ZK Proofs
Discussion on [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18533) centers on optimizing Kona-SP1 for ZK Proofs by offloading expensive cryptographic operations like keccak and sha2 to the host. The latest comment from @lnphi clarifies a notification mix-up, while @rdin777's earlier comment inquired about the progress in identifying all areas requiring offloading and if other computationally intensive operations might need similar treatment.

### Interoperability: Evaluating and Reworking Injected Replacement Transactions
Issue [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574) discusses the protocol's handling of invalid interop transactions through Replacement Blocks. The latest comment from @ajsutton highlights the downsides of the super node merely recording data, emphasizing concerns about accuracy and data availability, especially in the context of FaultDisputeGame and the transition to ZK proofs. @rdin777 previously noted a consensus to simplify the protocol by eliminating additional deposit transactions for proofs and requested architectural refactoring and specification updates.

### Node Synchronization Issues
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581) addresses problems with node synchronization, specifically "missing trie node" errors. @yaki-1337's latest comment indicates they are using a full node without an archive, experienced no improper shutdowns, and are using OP-GETH, asking for snapshot download locations or advice on switching to Reth. @rdin777 previously provided troubleshooting steps, asking for details on the execution client, full logs, and configuration flags to diagnose the issue.
