# ethereum-optimism/docs Daily Update (Dec 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW
Today's focus was on documentation refinement, including moving the faucets page, adding a new faucet, and addressing a missing document. Discussions on active issues covered optimizing Kona-SP1 for ZK Proofs, evaluating interop transaction replacement, and node synchronization problems.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Structure and Navigation Refinements
The documentation structure was improved by moving the faucets page to a more logical location and cleaning up unused files and links. This included updating navigation to reflect the new location and adding redirects for old paths. Additionally, a missing document was added to the Superchain information section.

- [#1923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1923)

### Faucet Information Enhancement
A new faucet, ethfaucet.com, was added to the documentation, providing 0.1 testnet ETH for various Superchain networks including Sepolia, OP Sepolia, and Base Sepolia.

### Content Reorganization
Several pages related to transactions, tools, and account abstraction were reorganized by removing introductory phrases and bringing the content up a level for better readability and structure.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona-SP1 Optimization for ZK Proofs
Discussion on [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18533) centered on optimizing Kona-SP1 for ZK Proofs by offloading expensive operations like keccak and sha2 to the host. A user expressed concern about a Cyrillic notification, which turned out to be a username similarity. The main discussion points revolved around identifying all code areas requiring offloading and whether other cryptographic or computationally intensive operations might also benefit from this approach.

### Interoperability Transaction Replacement Evaluation
Issue [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574) discussed evaluating and reworking injected replacement transactions for invalid interop transactions. The latest comments indicate a consensus to simplify the protocol by eliminating the additional deposit transaction for proofs. The proposed actions include assigning someone for architectural refactoring and updating the Interop specification to reflect how the Superlayer will generate necessary data without the extra deposit.

### Node Synchronization Issues
The issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581) addresses problems with node synchronization, specifically "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. The latest comment from @yaki-1337 asks for information on where to download snapshots with the latest blocks, following a previous request for more details on client configurations and full logs to diagnose the issue.
