# ethereum-optimism/docs Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
November began with a focus on project health and process management. The primary activity involved generating and closing monthly metrics reports for October 2025. This administrative task provided key insights into the repository's responsiveness, tracking the time-to-first-response and time-to-close for both issues and pull requests. No new documentation enhancements or code changes were made during this reporting period.
