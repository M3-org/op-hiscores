# ethereum-optimism/docs Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
August was a month of significant documentation enhancement and refinement, focused on supporting the latest OP Stack and Superchain capabilities. Major efforts were dedicated to creating comprehensive guides for advanced features, including a new tutorial for upgrading ERC-20 tokens for Superchain interoperability and detailed documentation for Flashblocks. Alongside new content, the team prioritized documentation health by updating outdated tutorials, correcting inaccuracies in the Fault Proofs Explainer, and refactoring operator guides for `op-challenger`. This combination of new feature support and rigorous maintenance demonstrates a commitment to providing a clear, accurate, and robust resource for developers and operators in the ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month's development work centered on expanding and improving the documentation to keep pace with the evolving Optimism ecosystem.

### Superchain and Interoperability Documentation
To support the growing Superchain, significant new content was added to guide developers through interoperability features:
- A new, detailed tutorial was introduced to guide users on upgrading existing ERC-20 tokens for use across the Superchain, covering contract upgrades and bridging mechanisms ([#1577](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1577)).
- The core Superchain operations guide was also updated with new information ([#1725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1725)).

### Operator and Fault Proof Documentation
Clarity and accuracy for chain operators were a key focus, with several improvements made to fault proof and deployment guides:
- The `op-challenger` documentation underwent a comprehensive refactor to improve clarity for operators ([#1702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1702)).
- Misleading information in the Fault Proofs Explainer was corrected to accurately reflect the `op-challenger` tool's functionality ([#1706](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1706)).
- A promotional banner was added to chain operator documentation to increase the visibility of the one-click deploy site ([#1719](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1719)).

### New Feature Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation for Flashblocks was added, providing guides for both application developers and chain operators on its features and implementation ([#1716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1716)).

### Documentation Maintenance and Bug Fixes
A steady stream of maintenance work ensured the documentation remained accurate and up-to-date:
- The `chain-dev-net.mdx` tutorial was updated to fix issues preventing users from launching a devnet ([#1714](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1714)).
- A precompile address conflict in a tutorial was fixed to ensure compliance with EIP-7587 ([#1715](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1715)).
- An outdated deprecation notice for Custom Gas Tokens was removed ([#1721](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1721)).
- Other fixes included correcting a broken link in the `spin-batcher` docs ([#1709](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1709)), updating faucet links ([#1703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1703)), and removing a reference to a deprecated SDK ([#1724](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1724)).

### Site and Dependency Management
- The project's font assets were updated to "Reforma" ([#1723](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1723)).
- Dependency updates were managed through pull requests for Snyk ([#1726](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1726)) and the `next` framework ([#1729](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1729)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in August focused on cleanup, process improvement, and planning for future work.

- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were closed, reflecting progress in process refinement and technical resolution. This included closing out July's monthly metrics reports ([#1707](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1707), [#1708](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1708)), completing several 2024 Q4 audit-related tasks ([#1713](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1713), [#1722](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1722)), and implementing a new requirement for PR titles ([#1728](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1728)). On the technical side, issues were closed for the successful enablement of Flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16688)) and the resolution of missing test logs ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17151)). Several features were also formally deprioritized, such as Flashblocks support in Kurtosis ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16514)).

- **New & Active Issues:** New issues indicate a forward-looking approach to documentation and tooling. A task was created to begin documenting the `MinBaseFee` feature ([#1710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1710)), and several new issues were opened to track ongoing 2024 Q4 audit items ([#1722](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1722), [#1727](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1727)). A major new initiative surfaced with a series of issues tracking the migration of the OP Deployer to use Forge ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17213), [#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17214), etc.). Important ongoing discussions include a complete overhaul of the `op-deployer` documentation ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1530)) and strategies for running the monorepo CI suite on `op-geth` PRs to ensure cross-repository stability ([#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/665)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was highlighted by a significant expression of community interest in a major development effort. A community member, `tooshiNoko`, proactively offered to take ownership of the entire suite of tasks related to migrating the OP Deployer to Forge ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17213) and related issues), demonstrating strong external engagement. Internal collaboration was also evident, with team members re-opening issues like `op-challenger` acceptance tests ([#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15948)) to ensure all work was fully completed. Ongoing discussions in issues like the `op-proposer` transaction failures ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/13502)) show a healthy feedback loop between users and the core team in debugging technical challenges.
