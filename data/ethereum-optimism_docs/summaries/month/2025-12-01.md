# ethereum-optimism/docs Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December was a month of significant refinement and reorganization for the Optimism documentation, with a strong focus on improving the experience for node and chain operators. Major efforts were dedicated to restructuring configuration guides, splitting JSON-RPC references for clarity, and updating network design examples. Early in the month, a series of issues related to the `op-challenger` and ZK proof systems were decisively closed, clarifying the path forward for fault proofs. However, the latter half of the month saw the emergence of critical active issues concerning node synchronization failures, client compatibility problems, and a potential security vulnerability, highlighting ongoing challenges in maintaining a stable and reliable node-operating environment across the Superchain.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
This month's development work centered on enhancing the clarity, accuracy, and structure of the documentation, particularly for technical operators.

-   **Node Operator Documentation Overhaul:** A major refactoring of the node operator documentation was completed to improve usability. This included splitting the JSON-RPC documentation into separate, clearer sections for `op-geth` and `op-node` ([#1905]), reorganizing configuration guides into client-specific pages ([#1916]), and updating the network design example with detailed configurations for sequencers and Tx Ingress Nodes ([#1913]).

-   **Documentation Refinement and Bug Fixes:** Several key fixes improved the overall quality of the documentation site. A widespread bug in tab formatting was corrected across numerous guides ([#1901]), and a large-scale effort fixed broken redirects to ensure accurate user navigation ([#1907]). Additionally, community-related documentation was consolidated for better accessibility ([#1879]), and SEO metadata was added to improve search visibility ([#1904]).

-   **Devnet and Deployment Enhancements:** The developer experience for local testing was improved by disabling P2P functionality by default in the `create-l2-rollup-example` script, which resolved common warnings ([#1906]). The `op-deployer` documentation was also ported from the monorepo, creating a centralized and updated resource ([#1911]).

-   **Configuration and Network Upgrade Updates:** The documentation was kept current with several updates. Versions for `rollup-boost` and `op-rbuilder` were updated for the U17 upgrade ([#1896]), and information about the Jovian Network Upgrade was added ([#1900]). The Actions SDK configuration documentation was also updated to reflect recent changes ([#1869]), and the batcher documentation was corrected to clarify throttling limits ([#1902]) and re-add the minimum blob configuration ([#1903]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The project saw the resolution of key documentation and fault-proof system issues, while new, critical discussions around node stability and security emerged.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **ZK Challenger Strategy:** A significant cluster of issues related to the `op-challenger` was closed. This solidified the decision to use `op-challenger` for challenging ZK games ([#18322]), determined that the succinct proposer would generate ZK proofs ([#18319]), and confirmed that existing `op-challenger` functionality for configuration and bond handling was sufficient ([#18427], [#18412], [#18413]).
    -   **Documentation & Interoperability:** Numerous documentation gaps were filled. Issues to create an interop security guide ([#1755]), API reference ([#1756]), and example implementations ([#1757], [#1758]) were closed. Key documentation for `op-deployer` ([#1769]), JSON-RPC APIs ([#1773]), and `op-reth` configuration ([#1893]) was also completed.
    -   **Devnet & Configuration:** An issue regarding warnings during devnet deployment was resolved and closed ([#1898]), and a UI bug with the theme-switcher was fixed ([#1752]).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Node Synchronization Failures:** A critical and recurring theme this month is node instability. Multiple users reported "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors, suggesting L1 execution clients are failing to provide necessary state data to `op-node` ([#18581]). Another active issue details `op-node` getting stuck in EL sync mode after a restart ([#18468]). These issues are significant blockers for node operators.
    -   **Client Compatibility:** Related to synchronization, a critical bug was identified regarding P2P connection flakiness in system tests with mixed `op-geth`/`op-reth` nodes, pointing to potential production compatibility problems ([#18570]).
    -   **Fault Proof & Security Concerns:** A critical bug was reported where `op-challenger` panics with a nil pointer dereference on L1s without Dencun support ([#18608]). Another critical issue highlighted a fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` related to zero-address handling, indicating a potential contract logic error ([#18554]).
    -   **Developer Experience:** A new issue reported that the `create-l2-rollup-example` tutorial is failing, presenting a barrier for new developers ([#1919]).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active issue discussions and contributions throughout the month. Community member Himess showed notable engagement, volunteering to take on tasks such as simplifying batcher code ([#18479]) and expressing interest in implementing a replica healthcheck for `op-rbuilder` ([#17685]). The detailed problem-solving discussions in threads concerning node synchronization ([#18581], [#18510]) and interop transaction handling ([#18574]) demonstrate a healthy feedback loop between users, contributors, and maintainers. The prompt responses and requests for detailed logs from maintainers like geoknee in these threads were crucial for diagnosing complex, multi-client issues affecting the ecosystem.
