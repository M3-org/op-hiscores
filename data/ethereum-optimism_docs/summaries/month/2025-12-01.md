# ethereum-optimism/docs Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December began with a strong focus on documentation quality and strategic decision-making. A significant effort was made to restructure and refine existing content, including consolidating community guides and fixing widespread formatting and navigation issues. The project also solidified its approach to ZK games by formally deciding to use `op-challenger`, closing out numerous related planning and configuration issues. While documentation saw major improvements, several active issues highlighted ongoing challenges for node operators, particularly around `op-node` synchronization after restarts and upgrades.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this period centered on improving the documentation's structure, accuracy, and user experience, alongside documenting recent network upgrades.

- **Documentation Restructuring and Quality of Life:** A series of pull requests significantly improved the documentation's usability. This included consolidating community-related documents into a more streamlined structure ([#1879](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1879)), fixing inconsistent tab formatting across numerous guides ([#1901](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1901)), and correcting broken redirects to ensure accurate user navigation ([#1907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1907)). To improve discoverability, SEO metadata was also added ([#1904](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1904)).

- **Network Upgrade and Configuration Updates:** The documentation was updated to keep pace with the evolving OP Stack. Information on the Jovian Network Upgrade was added ([#1900](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1900]), and versions for `rollup-boost` and `op-rbuilder` were updated for the upcoming U17 upgrade ([#1896](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1896)). The Actions SDK documentation was updated to reflect changes in `ActionsConfig` ([#1869](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1869)), and clarifications were made to the batcher's throttling descriptions and blob configuration ([#1902](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1902), [#1903](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1903)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this period was marked by the resolution of a major strategic question and the active discussion of persistent node operator challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **ZK Challenger Strategy Solidified:** A key decision was made to utilize `op-challenger` for challenging ZK games, resolving a spike issue ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18322)). This led to the closure of a large batch of related issues concerning ZK proof generation ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18319)), challenger configuration, and bond handling ([#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18412)-[#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18415), [#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18427)), streamlining future development efforts.
    - **Interoperability Documentation Initiative:** A set of issues aimed at creating comprehensive interoperability documentation were closed, covering a security guide, API reference, and implementation examples ([#1754](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1754)-[#1758](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1758)).
    - **Housekeeping and UI:** The monthly metrics reports for November were completed ([#1891](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1891), [#1892](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1892)), and a UI bug affecting the theme-switcher's visibility was fixed ([#1752](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1752)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`op-node` Synchronization Problems:** A significant point of discussion revolves around `op-node` synchronization failures. Multiple users reported `op-node` getting stuck in EL sync mode after a restart ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18468)) and failing to synchronize after an upgrade to v1.16.3 ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18510)). These issues appear to be a blocker for some node operators on Base Mainnet and other chains.
    - **Future Documentation and Tooling:** New issues were opened to plan for adding `op-reth` documentation to the node operator guides ([#1893](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1893), [#1894](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1894)). There is also an active discussion around creating a new `op-spammer` component to help catch bugs on devnets more effectively ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18482)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The period highlighted a collaborative environment, particularly in troubleshooting user-facing issues. The active discussions around `op-node` synchronization problems ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18468), [#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17448)) saw multiple community members sharing their experiences and potential workarounds, demonstrating a collective effort to diagnose and resolve critical issues. Furthermore, discussions on issues like the `SuperchainConfig` type porting ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/741)) and the proposed `op-spammer` component ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18482)) show thoughtful collaboration on documentation standards and future development tooling.
