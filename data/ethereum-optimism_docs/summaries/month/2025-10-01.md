# ethereum-optimism/docs Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's efforts focused on enhancing developer documentation and addressing key infrastructure issues. A significant update was made to the L2 rollup creation guide, providing developers with clearer instructions and practical examples. The project also formally closed out the Isthmus Upgrade, marking a major milestone. While direct code contributions were focused, critical discussions took place regarding future work on protocol stability, including a significant Go compatibility blocker in Cannon and refining the logic for the dispute monitor.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving the developer experience through documentation enhancements.

- **Enhanced L2 Rollup Creation Guide:** The documentation for creating L2 rollups was substantially improved ([#1775]). This update clarified container execution, updated target versions, and added a suite of example files, including environment setup, a Makefile, Docker Compose configuration, and deployment scripts.
- **Tutorial and Oracle Updates:** New pull requests were opened to improve user-facing documentation. One fixed a genesis config file naming issue in the quick start tutorial ([#1787]), while another added information about SUPRA Oracle and VRF to the oracles documentation ([#1788]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month involved closing out completed initiatives, managing project metrics, and engaging in deep discussions on active technical challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Infrastructure & Upgrades:** The tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade was officially closed ([#12703]), signifying its completion. An issue to refine flashblock alerts and runbooks was also resolved ([#17423]).
    - **Component Investigations:** Several issues were closed after investigation or changes in planning. A proposed architectural split of `op-node` was deemed "not planned" ([#16680]), and an investigation into L2EL syncing conditions was concluded ([#17628]).
    - **Project Management:** New issues were opened to generate and report on contribution metrics from September ([#1777], [#1778]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Cannon Go Compatibility Blocker:** A critical discussion is ongoing in [#17060] regarding Go 1.25's incompatibility with Cannon. The issue causes incorrect Keccak hash calculations, preventing correct block hash generation and posing a significant blocker for future upgrades.
    - **Dispute Monitor Sync Logic:** An important discussion in [#17814] focuses on improving how `op-dispute-mon` handles out-of-sync nodes. The proposed solution is to use the `CurrentL1` status to verify if a node has processed the relevant L1 block for a dispute, which would make the monitoring more robust against nodes on incorrect forks.
    - **Testing Strategy Shift:** A conversation in [#17475] revealed a strategic shift in testing `op-reth`, moving away from the deprecated `jovian kt-devnet` and toward integration with the `devstack` / `sysgo` system.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. The conversation around monitoring replica-healthchecks ([#17686]) provided a clear example of community interaction, where a maintainer guided a contributor by clarifying the scope of an issue and outlining the proper contribution process. This interaction highlights the project's commitment to mentoring contributors. Furthermore, discussions on the Cannon compatibility issue ([#17060]) and dispute monitor logic ([#17814]) show active collaboration among team members to diagnose and solve complex, core protocol challenges.
