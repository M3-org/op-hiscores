# ethereum-optimism/docs Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of targeted documentation enhancements and the resolution of key technical issues. The developer experience was improved with a practical guide for creating L2 rollups and updates to analytics tools documentation. Significant progress was made in closing out issues related to the Data Availability (DA) Footprint Limit and Flashblocks integration. Work also began on a major documentation restructuring, while important technical discussions continued around the behavior of core components like `op-dispute-mon` and `cannon`, setting the stage for future development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on improving developer resources and initiating a broad restructuring of the documentation.

*   **Developer Documentation Enhancements:**
    *   The guide for creating L2 rollups was significantly enhanced with example code, environment setup files, and scripts to provide a more practical, hands-on experience for users ([#1775](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1775)).
    *   Documentation for analytics tools was updated to reflect changes related to Dune, ensuring accuracy for developers ([#1784](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1784)).
    *   A minor update was made to communications regarding the U16a upgrade ([#1776](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1776)).

*   **Documentation Restructuring & New Content:**
    *   A significant information architecture overhaul was initiated with two new pull requests aimed at restructuring the documentation content ([#1791](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1791), [#1792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1792)).
    *   New pull requests were opened to add information about SUPRA Oracle and VRF ([#1788](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1788)) and to fix a naming issue in the quick start tutorial ([#1787](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1787)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project saw the resolution of several technical items and the start of new preparatory work for audits and component improvements.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Upgrades & Coordination:** The tracking issue for the now-complete Isthmus Upgrade was closed ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/12703)). Coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers for a new node was successfully completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17857)).
    *   **Technical Resolutions:**
        *   Progress was made on the **DA Footprint Limit**, with the closure of issues for specification updates ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/792]), acceptance tests ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17278]), and unit tests ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17395)).
        *   Several **Flashblocks-related** issues were resolved, including refining alerts ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17423)) and addressing message loss with new proxy upgrades ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17856)).
        *   An issue to split `op-node` components was closed as "not planned" after work was completed in a spike but not merged ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16680)).
    *   **Project Administration:** Monthly metrics reports for September's closed issues and opened pull requests were completed and closed ([#1777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1777), [#1778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1778)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Audit Preparation:** New issues were opened to track documentation updates required for the 2024 Q4 audit ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1789), [#1790](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1790)).
    *   **`op-dispute-mon` Synchronization:** A key discussion is ongoing regarding how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes. The debate centers on whether to trust the highest L2 block or use the `syncStatus` to determine if a node has processed the relevant L1 block for a dispute game ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17814)).
    *   **`cannon` Compatibility:** An issue with Go 1.25 is causing incorrect Keccak hashes within Cannon, preventing correct block hash calculations. The fix is not yet available in the latest Go patch release, representing a potential blocker ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17060)).
    *   **`op-conductor` Startup:** A new issue was raised concerning a sequencer failing to start with a "no unsafe head" error after being linked to `op-conductor`, pointing to a potential integration problem ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17899)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both technical problem-solving and community management. The active discussion on the `op-dispute-mon` synchronization issue ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17814)) showcased detailed technical debate between contributors. Additionally, an interaction on an issue regarding replica-healthchecks ([#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17686)) highlighted healthy community engagement, where a maintainer guided a contributor on project scope and process, encouraging future contributions. The successful coordination with external Flashblocks RPC providers also demonstrated effective collaboration with the broader ecosystem.
