# ethereum-optimism/docs Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of significant refinement and strategic planning for the Optimism documentation and underlying systems. Key efforts focused on enhancing developer experience by adding practical examples for L2 rollup creation and updating documentation for oracles and analytics tools. Operationally, the team successfully resolved a series of issues related to Flashblocks, improving system stability. Meanwhile, a major documentation restructuring initiative was kicked off, and critical technical discussions progressed on handling out-of-sync nodes in the dispute monitoring system, highlighting a continued focus on protocol security and robustness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving the quality and structure of developer-facing documentation.

- **Enhanced L2 Rollup Creation Guide:** Documentation was significantly improved to provide a clearer, more practical guide for developers creating their own L2 rollups. This included adding example code, environment setup files, a Makefile, Docker Compose configurations, and deployment scripts to clarify the process ([#1775]).

- **Documentation Content Updates:** Several updates were made to keep the documentation current and comprehensive:
    - The analytics tools page was updated to reflect changes related to Dune ([#1784]).
    - A pull request was opened to add information about SUPRA Oracle and VRF to the oracles documentation ([#1788]).
    - A minor fix was made to the quick start tutorial's genesis config file naming ([#1787]).
    - A small update was made to the U16a upgrade communications regarding the Base execution time ([#1776]).

- **Documentation Restructuring:** A significant effort to reorganize the documentation was initiated with two new pull requests proposing a new information architecture and structure ([#1791], [#1792]). This work aims to improve the overall usability and navigability of the docs.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month saw the resolution of key operational problems and the emergence of important new technical discussions and planning efforts.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks & RPCs:** A cluster of issues related to Flashblocks was resolved. This included refining alerts and runbooks ([#17423]), fixing an issue where Flashblocks were lost when forwarded ([#17856]), and successfully coordinating with RPC providers for a new node ([#17857]).
    - **Data Availability (DA) Footprint:** Progress was made on the DA footprint limit, with the closure of issues for updating specifications to use the `blobBaseFee` header field ([#792]) and for adding acceptance and unit tests ([#17278], [#17395]).
    - **System Maintenance & Upgrades:** The tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade was closed as complete ([#12703]), and a sequencer configuration on Sepolia was adjusted ([#17683]).
    - **Project Management:** Metrics reports for September's closed issues and opened pull requests were completed and closed ([#1777], [#1778]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`op-dispute-mon` Synchronization:** A critical discussion continued around `op-dispute-mon`'s behavior when a configured rollup RPC is out of sync ([#17814]). The debate centers on the best method to determine if a node is sufficiently synchronized to participate in dispute games, weighing whether to trust the highest L2 block or to check the `CurrentL1` from the sync status.
    - **Q4 Audit Preparation:** New issues were opened to track documentation updates required for the 2024 Q4 audit, signaling proactive preparation for the upcoming review ([#1789], [#1790]).
    - **Component-Specific Challenges:** An important compatibility issue was highlighted where Go 1.25 causes incorrect Keccak hashes in Cannon, preventing correct block hash calculations ([#17060]). A new issue also reported a sequencer startup failure in `op-conductor` ([#17899]).
    - **Strategic Shift:** Discussion on an acceptance test issue ([#17475]) indicated a strategic move away from the `jovian kt-devnet` towards integrating `op-reth` into the `devstack` / `sysgo` system.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both internal technical debates and external coordination. The ongoing discussion on the `op-dispute-mon` issue ([#17814]) involved detailed technical proposals from multiple team members, demonstrating a healthy, in-depth review process for complex problems.

Community engagement was also visible when a contributor opened a pull request to address an issue ([#17686]), prompting a maintainer to provide helpful guidance on the project's contribution workflow. This interaction fosters a welcoming environment for new contributors. Furthermore, the successful resolution of the Flashblocks RPC provider coordination ([#17857]) shows effective collaboration with external ecosystem partners like Blockscout.
