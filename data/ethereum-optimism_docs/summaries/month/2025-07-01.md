# ethereum-optimism/docs Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of significant enhancement and refinement for the Optimism documentation, with a strong focus on improving the experience for node operators and developers. The most notable achievement was the integration of comprehensive support for the Nethermind client ([#1615](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1615)), broadening the options for network participants. This was complemented by extensive maintenance work, including a repository-wide migration of explorer links from Etherscan to Blockscout ([#1693](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1693)), standardization of terminology, and preparations for the upcoming Upgrade 16. A forward-looking proposal to migrate the entire documentation platform to Mintlify ([#1691](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1691)) was also introduced, signaling a potential major investment in the documentation's infrastructure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on expanding operator guides, ensuring documentation consistency, and preparing for a network upgrade.

- **Node Operator Documentation Expansion:**
  - A major effort was completed to add comprehensive support for the Nethermind client, updating numerous pages related to node configuration, management, and architecture ([#1615](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1615)).
  - New guides were added to assist chain operators, including a complete batcher deployment guide ([#1665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1665)) and a tutorial for setting up a proposer ([#1645](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1645)).
  - The list of RPC providers was updated to include Grove ([#1685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1685)).

- **Documentation Consistency and Maintenance:**
  - A significant cleanup effort standardized terminology and capitalization across the documentation for terms like "cross-chain," "Superchain," and "L2ToL2" ([#1672](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1672), [#1677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1677), [#1678](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1678)).
  - All explorer links were standardized, migrating references from Etherscan to Blockscout for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia ([#1693](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1693)).
  - Several bug fixes were merged to correct broken image links ([#1694](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1694]), a broken external link ([#1683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1683]), and display issues in upgrade notices ([#1699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1699)).

- **Upgrade 16 Preparations:**
  - Documentation was updated to prepare for the upcoming network upgrade, including corrections to instructions ([#1684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1684]), the addition of consensus configurations for Holocene and Isthmus ([#1686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1686)), and the inclusion of the upgrade's execution date ([#1689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1689)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in July focused on closing out long-standing items related to infrastructure and tooling, while new issues and discussions pointed towards future improvements in testing and documentation platforms.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Infrastructure & Tooling:** Several issues concerning flashblocks deployment and enablement were closed, marking progress on their integration ([#16686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16686), [#16544](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16544), [#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16496)). Issues related to sequencer stability ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/11228), [#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/12240)) and improving `op-node` reset logic ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16314)) were also closed as resolved or no longer actionable.
  - **Documentation & Process:** The tracking issue for the Etherscan-to-Blockscout migration was closed following the merge of the corresponding PR ([#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1696)). A long-standing issue clarifying L1 contract deployment in a tutorial was also resolved ([#1401](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1401)). Administrative issues for June's metrics reports were closed as well ([#1681](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1681), [#1682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1682)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Documentation Platform:** A significant new pull request was opened to migrate the documentation site to Mintlify ([#1691](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1691]), representing a major potential future direction for the project's documentation.
  - **Testing Improvements:** A new issue was opened to align the acceptance test topology with the production environment, addressing a discrepancy in how the sequencer is exposed ([#16746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16746)). Active discussion continued on designing a service for mock EL sync testing ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16452)).
  - **Protocol Design:** An older issue proposing a system for congestion-based builder transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/306)) saw renewed interest, with community members expressing a desire to collaborate on the concept.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
July's activities highlighted a structured and collaborative approach to improving the Optimism ecosystem. The creation of administrative issues for monthly metrics and audits reflects a commitment to process and quality. Discussions on active issues, such as those related to testing infrastructure ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16452), [#16746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16746)), show focused collaboration on improving the reliability of the OP Stack
