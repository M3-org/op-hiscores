# ethereum-optimism/docs Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
June was a month of significant progress in both external-facing documentation and internal development stability. A major effort was dedicated to enhancing documentation for chain operators and developers, with the addition of a new sequencer setup guide and several tutorials focused on Superchain interoperability. Concurrently, a substantial push was made to improve the CI/CD pipeline and Superchain-ops tooling, resolving a large number of long-standing issues and leading to a more stable and efficient development process. While these improvements were being made, deep technical investigations continued into the performance and behavior of core components like `op-geth`, `op-supervisor`, and `op-batcher`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on refining documentation for accuracy, expanding guides for operators, and updating tooling references.

- **Operator & Developer Documentation:**
    - A detailed guide for setting up sequencer nodes for custom OP Stack chains was added, providing crucial instructions for new chain deployments ([#1632](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1632)).
    - Interoperability documentation was enhanced with a new tutorial on relaying arbitrary log messages using attestations ([#1613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1613)).
    - A critical bug in the deposit flow tutorial was fixed, resolving a long-standing issue that prevented users from completing the steps ([#1648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1648)).
    - Numerous smaller fixes were merged, correcting typos ([#1652](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1652), [#1653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1653)), fixing broken navigation links ([#1638](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1638), [#1659](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1659)), and removing outdated devnet information ([#1670](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1670)).

- **Node Configuration & Tooling Updates:**
    - The proposer configuration page was updated to reflect the latest setup from a recent config review ([#1668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1668)).
    - Node operator documentation was updated to align `devp2p/disc` defaults with OP EL's topology ([#1565](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1565)) and to update the challenger version for Upgrade 16 ([#1658](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1658)).
    - Reference documentation for `supersim` was updated with missing commands and help text, improving its usability for app developers ([#1669](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1669)).
    - The data glossary was expanded with new logic related to resolving dispute game costs ([#1655](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1655)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The month saw the resolution of a massive backlog of tooling and CI issues, while new discussions focused on core component performance and documentation needs.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **CI/CD and Superchain-Ops Tooling Overhaul:** A significant number of issues were closed, marking a major milestone in improving internal tooling. This included implementing "stacked" simulations in CI ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/342)), improving the OPCM Migrate Script ([#16326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16326)), refactoring `MultisigTask` architecture ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/636)), and enhancing CI job performance ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/648)). The overarching issue to investigate and improve CI flakiness was also closed, noting the release of a test flake report generator ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16271)).
    - **Developer Tooling & Features:** Issues related to the implementation and testing of flashblocks were closed ([#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16468), [#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/354)), as was a feature request for deterministic gas testing ([#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/408)).
    - **Bug Fixes & Documentation:** Key closures included the fix for the deposit flow tutorial ([#1226](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1226)), an outdated L2 rollup testnet guide ([#1614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1614)), and a bug in `op-deployer` that was resolved in a newer release candidate ([#16618](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16618)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Core Component Performance:** Several critical discussions are ongoing regarding the performance of OP Stack components. These include investigations into abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/613)), memory spikes in `op-batcher` during L1 congestion ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16537)), and `op-node` getting stuck with thousands of goroutines ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16332)).
    - **`op-supervisor` Behavior:** Complex discussions continued around improving the `op-supervisor`'s behavior during resets, particularly concerning L1 origin validity handling ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16315)) and fault proof data provisioning for non-genesis interop upgrades ([#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16166)).
    - **New Documentation Requests:** New issues were opened requesting a tutorial for updating a fee vault ([#1671](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1671)) and updated documentation for Movement Network's integration ([#1676](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1676)), highlighting areas for future content.
    - **Persistent Bugs:** The issue of `eth_getTransactionCount` returning an incorrect nonce for pending transactions remains active, with users continuing to seek updates ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/623)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was evident in both issue reporting and contribution interest. The active discussion around abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/613)) saw users providing detailed `pprof` data and system observations to help diagnose the problem. In a positive sign of open-source collaboration, multiple community members (`JoseValperga`, `Mau1401`, `nsancheznez`) expressed interest and offered to work on an issue to reduce noisy terminal output ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/781)), demonstrating a healthy and engaged contributor community.
