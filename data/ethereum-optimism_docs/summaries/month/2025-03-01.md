# ethereum-optimism/docs Monthly Report (March 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
March's documentation efforts centered on improving the developer experience for external chain operators within the Superchain ecosystem. A significant new initiative began to overhaul the documentation for creating an OP Stack Rollup testnet, focusing on the modern `op-deployer` tool. This work was prompted by community feedback highlighting confusion caused by outdated manual deployment instructions. Active discussions quickly surfaced key technical complexities related to the fault-proof system, high RPC usage, and specific `op-deployer` behaviors, setting the stage for crucial documentation updates.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no major pull requests were merged according to the provided data, development work was initiated to address documentation gaps for OP Stack testnet deployment. The primary focus is on creating clear, updated guides for using the `op-deployer` tool. This effort, tracked in a related pull request ([#1539](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1539)), aims to detail the nuances of the deployment process, including the specifics of the permissioned dispute game implementation.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The month's activity was driven by identifying and defining new documentation requirements rather than closing existing issues.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed in March.

- **New & Active Issues:** The most significant activity revolved around a new issue, [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1530), which became the central point of discussion.
    - **OP Stack Testnet Documentation ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1530)):** This issue was opened to address the need for clear documentation on creating a testnet with `op-deployer`. The discussion revealed that current guides confusingly mix old manual methods with the new tool. Key technical points raised include the high volume of `eth_call` RPC requests observed when using the permissioned fault-proof system, and clarifications that `op-deployer` currently only deploys the permissioned dispute game (game type 1) and has a circular dependency related to the absolute prestate hash.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident in the active discussion surrounding the new testnet documentation issue ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1530)). Community members and developers engaged in a technical deep-dive to diagnose the challenges external chain operators face. The detailed feedback, covering topics from RPC load to the specifics of dispute game deployment, demonstrates a healthy, technically proficient community actively working to improve the onboarding experience and support the growth of the Superchain.
