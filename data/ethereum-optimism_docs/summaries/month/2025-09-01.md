# ethereum-optimism/docs Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September began with a focus on documentation maintenance, issue resolution, and planning for future technical enhancements. While no new features were merged, key progress was made in clarifying protocol behavior for developers, specifically regarding `op-proposer` errors. An important ongoing discussion centers on extending `op-dispute-mon` to support new game types, a critical step for the Superchain ecosystem. The month's activity also included routine project management tasks, such as initiating the creation of the previous month's metrics reports.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, development work was centered on maintaining the existing documentation.

*   **Documentation Maintenance:** A pull request ([#1732](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1732)) was opened to remove a dead link, reflecting ongoing efforts to ensure the accuracy and usability of the documentation.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month involved resolving existing problems, tracking project metrics, and discussing future requirements.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **`op-proposer` Error Clarification:** Issue [#17042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17042) was closed after a discussion clarified that `GameAlreadyExists` errors are expected behavior for the `op-proposer` when the safe head has not advanced. This resolution provides valuable context for node operators, explaining that the solution involves ensuring the batcher is running correctly.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Monthly Metrics:** Two administrative issues ([#1730](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1730), [#1731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1731)) were opened to track the generation of metrics reports for August 2025.
    *   **Dispute Monitor Enhancement:** A significant discussion continues in issue [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17286) regarding the need for `op-dispute-mon` to support `cannon-kona` game types. The conversation highlights the technical challenge of ensuring the monitor can correctly handle new game types without creating arbitrary ones, which is essential for fault-proof system interoperability.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active issue discussions. The conversation around `op-dispute-mon` support ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17286)) shows contributors working together to define technical requirements for a necessary protocol update. Furthermore, the resolution of the `op-proposer` error issue ([#17042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17042)) through community discussion demonstrates effective knowledge sharing among project participants.
