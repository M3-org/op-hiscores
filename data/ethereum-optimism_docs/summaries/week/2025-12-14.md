# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on identifying and triaging critical issues across the OP Stack, with no new code merged. Key challenges emerged in the fault proof system, including a nil pointer dereference in `op-challenger` on non-Dencun chains. A significant fuzzing test failure was discovered in `OptimismPortal2`, and ongoing discussions addressed node synchronization problems, client interoperability, and the architectural design of interop transactions. The focus was firmly on system stability, security, and collaborative problem-solving in preparation for future development.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Based on the provided reports for the week, there were no new features, bug fixes, or other code contributions merged into the repository. Development efforts were concentrated on investigating and discussing active issues.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The week was defined by active issue management, with a focus on uncovering and addressing foundational challenges.

*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed this week.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Critical Bug Identification:** Two significant bugs were highlighted: a nil pointer dereference in `op-challenger` when running against an L1 without Dencun blob support ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18608)), and a critical fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2` when the `_7702Target` is set to the zero address ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18554)). Both have been flagged for immediate attention.
    *   **Documentation & Tutorials:** New issues were opened for a broken link in the governance FAQ ([#1918](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1918)) and a failing `create-l2-rollup-example` tutorial ([#1919](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1919)).
    *   **Node & Client Stability:** Discussions continued around node synchronization failures presenting as `missing trie node` errors ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581)) and flaky P2P connections between `op-reth` and `op-geth` clients ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18570)).
    *   **Protocol Design:** A key architectural discussion is ongoing regarding the necessity of an extra deposit transaction for the fault proof system, with contributors debating alternative solutions involving the Supernode ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident through in-depth technical discussions within GitHub issues. Contributors like `rdin777` played a key role in triaging new bugs, prioritizing critical issues, and requesting detailed information to aid debugging across multiple threads. The active debate in issue [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18574) between `ajsutton`, `axelKingsley`, and `Inphi` showcases collaborative refinement of core protocol mechanics. The overall activity points to a healthy, engaged team focused on maintaining stack security and stability.
