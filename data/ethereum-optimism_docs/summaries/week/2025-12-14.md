# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on identifying and triaging critical issues across the stack, with no new code merged. Significant problems were surfaced in the fault proof system, node synchronization, and core contract logic. Key discussions focused on a nil pointer dereference in `op-challenger`, P2P connection instability between `op-geth` and `op-reth` nodes, and a critical fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2`. These findings highlight a period of intense debugging and stabilization ahead of future development and the finalization of the U18 release.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
No pull requests were merged during the observed period. Development efforts were focused on investigating and discussing active issues.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The week was defined by active issue management, with a focus on stability and security. No issues were closed, but several critical new and ongoing discussions took place.

- **New Issues:**
  - **Documentation & Tutorials:** Two issues were opened concerning the user-facing documentation: a broken link in the governance FAQ (`#1918`) and a failure in the `create-l2-rollup-example` tutorial (`#1919`).

- **Active Issues:**
  - **Fault Proof & Node Stability:** A significant portion of the week's focus was on system stability.
    - A critical bug in `op-challenger` (`#18608`) causes a panic on L1 chains without Dencun support, pointing to an issue with uninitialized blob fee metrics.
    - Node interoperability is under scrutiny due to flaky P2P connections between `op-reth` and `op-geth` nodes in system tests (`#18570`).
    - Users continue to report `missing trie node` errors, suggesting issues with L1 Execution Client state provision to Op-Node (`#18581`).
  - **Security & Protocol Logic:**
    - A critical fuzzing test failure was identified in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` (`#18554`), where a deposit to the zero address causes an unexpected revert, indicating a potential logic error in contract aliasing.
    - Discussions continue on the design of interop transaction handling (`#18574`), specifically on the necessity of recording replacement transactions for the fault proof system.
  - **Upgrades & Performance:**
    - Progress is being tracked on finalizing the U18 release, pending governance approvals (`#18548`).
    - Work continues on optimizing `kona-sp1` for ZK Proofs by offloading expensive cryptographic operations like `keccak` to the host (`#18533`).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was concentrated within GitHub issues, characterized by detailed bug reporting and in-depth technical discussions. Users provided comprehensive environment details for critical bugs like the `op-challenger` panic (`#18608`), enabling focused investigation. Maintainers and contributors engaged in collaborative diagnosis on complex topics, such as the debate over interop transaction proofs (`#18574`) and requests for detailed logs to debug node synchronization failures (`#18581`). The activity reflects a healthy, responsive triage process where the community works together to pinpoint and understand core protocol issues.
