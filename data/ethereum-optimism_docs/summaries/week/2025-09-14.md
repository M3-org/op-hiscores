# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by significant progress in both documentation and protocol stability. A major highlight was the complete modernization of the L2 rollup testnet tutorial ([#1705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705)), providing chain operators with up-to-date guidance using the latest `op-d` tools. On the infrastructure front, a long-standing archive node synchronization issue was resolved by implementing a configurable timeout flag ([#13852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/13852)). Looking ahead, new features for custom gas tokens, bridge recovery, and an operator fee vault entered the development pipeline, while important discussions began around establishing a new convention for network upgrade transactions ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/781)) and preparing the `op-node` for the upcoming Fusaka hardfork.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This week's completed work focused on improving developer experience and documentation accuracy, while several new feature proposals were initiated.

-   **Documentation Enhancements:**
    -   The tutorial for deploying an OP Stack testnet chain was comprehensively updated to reflect the latest `op-d` tools, a significant improvement for chain operators ([#1705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705)).
    -   A bug fix was implemented to correct a contract address within the documentation, enhancing its accuracy ([#1745](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1745)).

-   **New Feature Development (In Progress):**
    -   Work began on several new features with the opening of draft pull requests for an operator fee vault ([#1741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1741)), custom gas tokens ([#1743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1743)), and a bridge recovery mechanism ([#1744](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1744)).

-   **Dependency Management:**
    -   Routine dependency updates were made for `brace-expansion` ([#1747](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1747)) and `next` ([#1748](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1748)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of several infrastructure and tooling problems, while new discussions focused on protocol conventions and future hardfork preparations.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Infrastructure & Stability:** A persistent block synchronization slowdown in Base and Optimism archive nodes was resolved ([#13852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/13852)). An issue concerning failed RLP receipt decoding was also closed after a fix was tested ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/679)).
    -   **Protocol & Tooling:** Several issues were resolved, including the threat modeling for the DA Footprint Limit ([#336](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/336)), the creation of a Forge Deployer CLI wrapper ([#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17214)), and the standardization of address structs to reduce code duplication ([#14977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/14977)).
    -   **Testing:** Issues related to load testing flashblocks ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16756)) and evaluating partner support criteria ([#16765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16765)) were closed, with links to detailed reports provided.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Network Upgrade Convention:** A significant new issue ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/781)) was opened to establish a safer convention for network upgrade transactions that deploy contracts. The discussion includes a detailed analysis of address collision resistance and a proposal to use a `CREATE2`-based approach for enhanced safety.
    -   **Fusaka Hardfork Prep:** Discussions are ongoing to prepare the `op-node` for the Fusaka hardfork, focusing on compatibility with upstream Geth changes and EIP 7892 ([#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17493)).
    -   **DA Footprint Limit:** Following the closure of the threat modeling issue, a new issue was opened to document the risks associated with configuring the DA Footprint Limit scalar ([#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1742)).
    -   **Flaky Test:** The `TestPreNoInbox` test continues to exhibit flakiness, with recent attempts to fix it proving unsuccessful, requiring further investigation ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17298)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
-   The week saw deep technical collaboration, particularly in the discussion around a new convention for network upgrade transactions ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/781)). Contributor `@protolambda` provided a detailed cryptographic analysis, suggesting a `CREATE2`-based approach to prevent address collisions and demonstrating a proactive approach to protocol security.
-   Cross-repository work was evident in the resolution of `op-acceptor` logging and parallelism improvements ([#461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/461), [#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/462)), which were addressed by a pull request in the separate `infra` repository.
-   Maintainers actively engaged with the community, as seen in the token bridging issue ([#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1203)), where a maintainer helped a user diagnose a problem by clarifying the expected behavior of `OptimismMintableERC20` tokens.
