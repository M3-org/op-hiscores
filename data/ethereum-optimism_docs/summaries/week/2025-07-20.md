# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were highlighted by a major documentation enhancement to integrate Nethermind support, significantly expanding guidance for node operators. Alongside this feature work, the team focused on maintenance and cleanup, resolving several bugs related to image links and display issues. Progress was also made on infrastructure components, with the closure of multiple issues related to flashblocks deployment. The week was characterized by a healthy mix of new feature documentation, routine maintenance, and the resolution of long-standing technical issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The week saw one major documentation feature merged, accompanied by several smaller fixes and new work initiated.

- **Nethermind Node Support Documentation**
  A significant update was merged to incorporate comprehensive documentation for the Nethermind execution client. This involved extensive changes across node operator guides, including architecture, configuration, and management pages, to provide full support for users running Nethermind nodes ([#1615](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1615)).

- **Documentation Maintenance and Fixes**
  Several pull requests were merged to improve the quality and accuracy of the documentation. This included fixing broken image links across multiple pages ([#1694](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1694)) and resolving display issues in upgrade notices ([#1699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1699)).

- **New Content and Migrations**
  Work has begun on improving content management and clarity. A new pull request aims to add timestamps to chain upgrades ([#1697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1697)), while another was opened to handle content migration redirects ([#1700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1700)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on closing out infrastructure-related tasks and older technical discussions, while opening new issues for future audit requirements.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks Integration:** Three issues related to the deployment and enablement of flashblocks were closed, marking progress on its integration for op-sepolia ([#16544](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16544), [#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16496), [#16686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16686)).
  - **Technical Cleanup:** Two long-standing issues were resolved and closed. One concerned improving the `op-supervisor` reset unsafe target functionality, which was deemed complete given recent changes ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16314)). The other, related to creating a reusable logging utility, was closed as the desired functionality is already supported in `op-service` ([#15139](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15139)).
  - **Content Migration:** An issue tracking the migration of Etherscan links to Blockscout was closed ([#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1696)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Audit Preparation:** A new issue was created to track documentation updates required for a 2024 Q4 audit ([#1701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1701)).
  - **Ongoing Discussions:** An active discussion continues around adding a semgrep rule for function naming conventions, though work appears blocked by a repository configuration ([#15115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15115)). Another discussion on test target setup ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/375)) saw updates linking to related work in other repositories.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident through the cross-repository coordination noted in issue [#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/375), which linked to related work in the `optimism` and `infra` repositories. This suggests healthy communication between teams working on different parts of the stack. The closure of older, complex issues like [#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16314) and [#15139](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15139) after discussion indicates a proactive approach to resolving technical debt and maintaining project health.
