# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Nov 30 - 6, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on advancing the `op-challenger` service and improving documentation. A significant block of work was completed to finalize support for ZK game types, closing numerous related issues and solidifying the decision to use `op-challenger` for ZK game challenges. In parallel, efforts were made to enhance documentation by consolidating community-related information and planning new guides for node operators using `op-reth`. However, several active issues reported by users, including `op-node` sync and signature errors, highlight ongoing challenges for node operators.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on documentation enhancements to improve clarity and keep pace with protocol updates.

- **Documentation Consolidation:** To improve discoverability and coherence, various community-related documents were combined. This effort streamlined information across governance, developer tools, chain operator references, and contribution guides ([#1879](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1879)).
- **Upgrade Notice Updates:** The documentation for the upcoming upgrade 17 was updated to reflect the correct version numbers for `rollup-boost` and `op-rbuilder`, ensuring node operators have accurate information ([#1896](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1896)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was marked by the resolution of a major feature set for `op-challenger` and the emergence of new and persistent issues for node operators.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **`op-challenger` and ZK Games:** A large cluster of issues related to the `op-challenger` was resolved. The decision was finalized to use `op-challenger` for challenging ZK games ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18322)), and the service was updated to support ZK game types ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18321)). The investigation into ZK proof generation was also concluded, with the succinct proposer chosen for the task ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18319)).
    - **Challenger Configuration:** Several related issues were closed, improving challenger configuration and bond handling. This included enhancements to test coverage ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18427)) and updates to how the challenger fetches bond values and handles address changes ([#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18413), [#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18414), [#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18415)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Node Operator Blockers:** Users continue to report significant issues with `op-node`. One user reported that their Base Mainnet node is blocked by an issue where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18468)). Another issue regarding an "invalid block signature" error on testnet deployments gained a new report from a user experiencing the same problem ([#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17448)).
    - **Documentation Planning:** New issues were created to plan for future documentation, including adding `op-reth` sections to the node operator guides ([#1893](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1893), [#1894](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1894)) and generating November metrics reports ([#1891](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1891), [#1892](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1892)).
    - **Ongoing Discussions:** A discussion on porting the `SuperchainConfig` type definition into the documentation is active, with a contributor awaiting feedback on the proposed format ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/741)). The long-standing `proxyd` time travel issue ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/501)) was updated, with work scheduled to resume in January 2026.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was evident in issue reporting and discussion. Multiple users collaborated in issue threads ([#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17448), [#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18468)) to confirm and provide context on bugs, particularly those affecting node operators. The active discussion around the `SuperchainConfig` documentation ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/741)) also highlights the collaborative process between contributors and maintainers in defining specification formats.
