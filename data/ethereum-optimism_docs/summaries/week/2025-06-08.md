# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Jun 8 - 14, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a strong focus on improving documentation quality and developer experience. Significant progress was made in fixing long-standing tutorial bugs, particularly the critical fix for the deposit flow tutorial ([#1648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1648)). The team also expanded the documentation by adding a new tutorial on relaying log messages for interoperability ([#1613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1613)) and updating key configurations for node operators. While documentation saw clear improvements, challenging technical issues, such as CI flakiness and an incorrect nonce bug, remain active areas of investigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on refining existing content, adding new tutorials, and ensuring node operator information is up-to-date.

- **Tutorial & Guide Enhancements:**
    - A critical bug in the deposit flow tutorial was fixed, resolving issues that prevented users from completing the steps ([#1648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1648)).
    - A new tutorial was added to the interoperability section, explaining how to relay arbitrary log messages using attestations ([#1613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1613)).
    - A new pull request for an "Interop testing tutorial" was opened and is awaiting review ([#1654](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1654)).

- **Node Operator & Configuration Updates:**
    - Node operator documentation was updated to align `devp2p/disc` defaults with OP EL's discovery topology ([#1565](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1565)).
    - The U16 challenger version was updated across relevant notices and metrics documentation ([#1658](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1658)).
    - The hardware requirements date in the node operator tutorial was updated for accuracy ([#1662](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1662)).

- **General Documentation Maintenance:**
    - Navigation issues within the smart contracts section were corrected ([#1638](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1638), [#1659](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1659)).
    - The audits page was updated to point to the monorepo for more current information, removing an outdated table ([#1656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1656)).
    - The data glossary was expanded with new logic for handling costs in dispute games ([#1655](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1655)).
    - Minor typographical errors were corrected in various notices ([#1652](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1652), [#1653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1653)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of several user-facing documentation issues, while discussions continued on deeper, more complex technical challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - A long-standing and critical issue with the "Deposit flow" tutorial was closed after a successful fix ([#1226](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1226)).
    - An issue regarding an outdated L2 rollup testnet guide was closed, as the team tracks such updates internally ([#1614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1614)).
    - A dependency issue concerning a missing `dist` directory in `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` was resolved ([#1146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1146)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **New Issue:** A new issue was opened to address incorrect Docker image references on the releases page for node operators ([#1657](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1657)).
    - **CI Flakiness:** Investigating CI flakiness remains a high priority ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16271), [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16378)). Discussions highlighted that most instability stems from infrastructure issues (e.g., CircleCI machines, networking) rather than test logic. A list of the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests was generated to focus efforts.
    - **Incorrect Nonce Bug:** The issue where `eth_getTransactionCount` returns an incorrect nonce for pending transactions on the Base node ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/623)) remains active, with users still awaiting a resolution for transactions getting stuck.
    - **Protocol Discussions:** Technical discussions are ongoing for several key areas, including improving L1 origin validity in the supervisor ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16315)), handling event overflow in the `op-supervisor` ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16335)), and changes to the Fault Proof creator contract ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15789)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted active collaboration between core contributors and the broader community. User-reported issues, such as the incorrect nonce bug ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/623)) and a query on state dumping ([#390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/390)), received attention, demonstrating a responsive feedback loop. Internally, there was significant discussion around complex topics like CI flakiness and protocol-level improvements, indicating a coordinated effort to enhance the stack's stability and functionality
