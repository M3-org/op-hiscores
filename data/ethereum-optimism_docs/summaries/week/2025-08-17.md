# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a strong focus on documentation accuracy and usability for both chain operators and developers. Significant effort went into refining core technical explainers, such as the Fault Proofs documentation, and updating critical tutorials to prevent user friction. Key infrastructure progress was also noted with the successful enablement of Flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers. The team balanced these proactive enhancements with diligent maintenance, closing out monthly metric reports and addressing audit follow-ups.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the quality, accuracy, and accessibility of the documentation.

- **Operator Documentation Enhancements:** A major push was made to improve resources for chain operators. This included a comprehensive refactor of the `op-challenger` documentation for better clarity ([#1702]), a correction to misleading information in the Fault Proofs Explainer ([#1706]), and the addition of a promotional banner to operator pages to increase visibility of the one-click deploy site ([#1719]).

- **Developer Tutorial and Tooling Updates:** Several updates were merged to improve the developer experience. An outdated `chain-dev-net.mdx` tutorial was fixed, unblocking users from launching a devnet ([#1714]). The "Adding a precompile" tutorial was corrected to ensure compliance with EIP-7587 ([#1715]), and the faucets page was updated with a new Sepolia link and alphabetized for better usability ([#1703]).

- **Documentation Maintenance and Cleanup:** To keep the documentation current, an outdated deprecation notice for Custom Gas Tokens was removed ([#1721]).

- **New Initiatives:** Work has begun on a redesign of the documentation homepage ([#1718]) and the creation of a new `npm-gulp.yml` workflow file ([#1720]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving infrastructure challenges, closing out administrative tasks, and advancing discussions on long-standing technical items.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Infrastructure:** A significant issue was closed confirming that Flashblocks are now enabled on all Sunnyside sequencers for Sepolia, with failover successfully tested ([#16688]).
    - **Event System:** An issue concerning the removal of two events from the event system was resolved ([#17001]).
    - **Reporting & Audits:** Monthly metrics reports for July 2025 were closed ([#1707], [#1708]), as was an issue related to the 2024 Q4 audit ([#1713]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No critical new issues were opened this week.
    - **Validation Test Refinement ([#686]):** A long-running discussion on adding validation tests for chain configurations saw renewed activity, with a planned meeting to review and prioritize which tests should be implemented.
    - **RPC Response Content Type ([#389]):** An older issue regarding missing content types in RPC responses received new community interest, with a user inquiring about contributing a fix.
    - **Missing Test Logs ([#17151]):** An investigation into missing logs for failed `op-acceptance-tests` is ongoing. A potential solution has been identified, which involves moving the tests to a different workflow where logs are properly captured.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the multi-contributor effort to diagnose and resolve complex issues. The discussion around missing test logs in [#17151] involved several team members working together to pinpoint the cause. Similarly, the plan to hold a dedicated meeting for issue [#686] shows a collaborative approach to tackling long-standing technical debt. The external interest in contributing a fix for issue [#389] highlights healthy community engagement with the project's ongoing technical challenges.
