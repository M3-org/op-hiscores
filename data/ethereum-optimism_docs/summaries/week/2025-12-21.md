# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on refining and enhancing the documentation for both developers and chain operators. Key progress included a significant update to the permissionless switch guide and a comprehensive refresh of the project's branding assets. A new guide for revenue sharing automation was also proposed. Meanwhile, technical discussions continued to ensure the correctness of `op-challenger` trace outputs, highlighting an ongoing focus on protocol-level accuracy and the deprecation of `op-supervisor`.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving the accuracy and presentation of existing documentation.

- **Chain Operator Guide Enhancement:** The documentation for the permissionless switch was updated to provide greater accuracy for chain operators. The guide now correctly references the `AnchorStateRegistry` and incorporates other necessary adjustments ([#1920](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1920)).

- **Branding and Asset Refresh:** A project-wide update to branding assets was completed to modernize the documentation's visual identity. New favicons and lockup SVGs were introduced, and the `public/logos` directory was streamlined by removing unused files ([#1929](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1929)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving several documentation tickets and advancing discussion on a key technical issue.

- **Closed Issues:** Several documentation issues were resolved, improving content structure and accuracy. This included a major update to the chain architecture documentation to incorporate `op-challenger` and reflect the removal of `op-supervisor` ([#1763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1763)). Minor fixes were also addressed, such as correcting a path in a chain operator tutorial ([#1926](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1926)) and a process-related request ([#1927](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1927)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - A new pull request ([#1928](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1928)) was opened, proposing a new guide for revenue sharing automation.
    - Discussion continued on the `op-challenger` trace output issue ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18643)). It was confirmed that the functionality now works correctly in the super node trace provider. The issue will remain open until an integration test confirms alignment between `op-challenger` and `op-program`, ensuring end-to-end correctness.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the focused technical discussion around the `op-challenger` trace output issue ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18643)). The conversation shows team members coordinating to validate behavior across different components (`op-challenger`, `op-program`, and the super node trace provider) to ensure protocol integrity. The week's activity reflects a period of steady refinement and targeted problem-solving by the core team.
