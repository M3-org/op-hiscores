# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by a dual focus on immediate operational needs and strategic backlog refinement. A new upgrade notice page ("Upgrade 16a") was promptly added and subsequently patched, ensuring chain operators have critical information. Concurrently, a significant number of issues were closed, most notably signaling the deprioritization of Kurtosis devnet development. This cleanup effort also resolved long-standing items related to flashblocks monitoring, proof system tests, and outdated documentation, streamlining the project's focus towards future priorities like `op-program` optimizations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on crucial documentation updates for an upcoming network upgrade.

*   **Upgrade 16a Documentation:** A new notice page for "Upgrade 16a" was created to inform users and operators ([#1733](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1733)). A follow-up fix was quickly merged to add necessary chain operator tasks to the notice ([#1739](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1739), [#1740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1740)).
*   **General Documentation Improvements:** Automated fixes were applied to correct breadcrumbs and update the spelling dictionary, which also had the benefit of improving search results ([#1735](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1735), [#1736](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1736)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a major effort in backlog grooming, closing a large volume of issues to clarify development priorities.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Kurtosis Devnet Deprioritization:** A significant number of issues related to the Kurtosis devnet were closed with the rationale that the work is "not currently a priority." This signals a clear shift away from active development in this area, affecting tasks like genesis checks, performance improvements, and new tests ([#15753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15753), [#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/14390), [#15050](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15050), [#15558](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15558)).
    *   **Flashblocks Stability Confirmed:** Several issues concerning the deployment, monitoring, and health of flashblocks on mainnet sequencers were resolved, indicating the feature is now stable ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16759), [#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16760), [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17317)).
    *   **Proof System & Infrastructure Cleanup:** Smoke test issues for `op-challenger`, `op-dispute-mon`, and `op-proposer` were closed as they are no longer required ([#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/140), [#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/141), [#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/142)). An issue on flashblocks threat modeling was also closed after concluding no novel risks were introduced ([#17144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17144)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **`op-program` Optimization:** A new issue ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17416)) was opened to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program` specs. A draft PR is already underway, showing this is an active area of development.
    *   **CI Test Expansion:** To enhance testing, an issue was created to add "soneium" to the contract upgrade tests in CI ([#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17332)), and a PR to address it has already been opened.
    *   **Kurtosis Websockets:** The discussion on issue [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17194) (Implement Websockets support) is notable. After being closed as "Won't implement," it was reopened to ensure a corresponding `TODO` in the codebase is removed, highlighting a commitment to code hygiene even for deprioritized features.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the decisive actions taken to refine the project's focus. The discussion between contributors `alfonso-op` and `ajsutton` around the Kurtosis issues ([#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/14390), [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17194)) demonstrates healthy debate and alignment on deprioritization. The reopening of an issue to ensure a code comment was removed before final closure shows strong attention to detail and peer review. Furthermore, the rapid response to newly opened issues with draft pull requests ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17416), [#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17332)) indicates a highly engaged and responsive team.
