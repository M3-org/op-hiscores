# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
The start of the week focused on documentation maintenance, issue resolution, and planning for future enhancements. Key activities included proposing dependency updates to keep the documentation site current and removing dead links. An important issue regarding `op-proposer` errors was resolved, providing clarity to users on expected behavior. Meanwhile, an active discussion is shaping the requirements for updating `op-dispute-mon` to support new `cannon-kona` game types, a necessary step for advancing the fault-proof system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this period centered on routine maintenance and site upkeep, with two new pull requests opened to improve the documentation platform.

- **Dependency Management:** A pull request ([#1729](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1729)) was opened to upgrade the `next` framework from version 14.2.21 to 14.2.32. This ensures the documentation site stays current with the latest stable version of its underlying framework.
- **Content Fixes:** A minor but helpful change was proposed in [#1732](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1732) to remove a dead link from the documentation, improving user experience.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management involved clarifying existing problems, tracking project metrics, and discussing future development needs.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **`op-proposer` Error Clarification:** Issue [#17042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17042) was closed after a discussion clarified that `GameAlreadyExists` errors from the `op-proposer` are expected if the safe head has not advanced. This resolution helps users distinguish between normal operation and actual problems with their batcher configuration.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Monthly Metrics:** Two new issues, [#1730](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1730) and [#1731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1731), were created to track the metrics for closed issues and opened pull requests for August 2025, indicating ongoing project health monitoring.
  - **`op-dispute-mon` Enhancement:** A significant discussion continued in issue [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17286) regarding the need for `op-dispute-mon` to support `cannon-kona` game types. The conversation has helped define the requirement that the monitor must explicitly recognize and handle new game types while returning an error for any that are unsupported, laying the groundwork for a future update.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the issue triage process. The resolution of the `op-proposer` issue ([#17042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17042)) demonstrates a responsive feedback loop where user-reported problems are investigated and clarified for the benefit of the wider community. Furthermore, the active discussion around `op-dispute-mon` support ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17286)) shows collaborative effort in defining technical requirements for upcoming development work.
