# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a dual focus on enhancing the developer experience and finalizing long-standing technical initiatives. A significant restructuring of the app developer documentation was completed, improving content organization for builders on Optimism. Concurrently, the team made substantial progress in closing out work related to the Jovian upgrade by finalizing key parameters and transaction bytecodes. This period also marked a clear strategic shift in local development tooling, with the deprecation of Kurtosis in favor of enhancing `op-up` as the primary tool for spinning up local devnets.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on major documentation refactoring and improvements to developer tooling.

- **Documentation Restructuring for App Developers:** A major effort was completed to improve the organization and accessibility of content for developers. This involved restructuring over 50 files related to app development guides, bridging, interoperability, and tutorials ([#1792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1792)). As part of this cleanup, a bug fix for Superchain redirects was also merged ([#1800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1800)).

- **L2 Rollup Example Enhancements:** The `create-l2-rollup-example` received key updates to improve its usability. A new feature was added to automatically fund developer accounts ([#1803](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1803]), and a bug was fixed where `rollup.sequencerhttp` was being set incorrectly ([#1804](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1804)).

- **New Content Initiatives:** Work began on new documentation, with pull requests opened for a new monitoring guide ([#1796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1796)) and a "U17 notice" ([#1795](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1795)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The week saw a significant effort in issue triage, closing out old tasks and identifying key areas for future work.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Jovian Upgrade Finalization:** Several issues related to the Jovian upgrade were closed, marking the finalization of key details. This includes updating the finalized bytecode for upgrade transactions ([#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/772)) and setting the default value for `daFootprintGasScalar` to 400 ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/773)).
    - **Tooling & Process Deprecation:** A strategic decision to move away from Kurtosis for local development was solidified by the closure of an issue to support local `op-geth` builds with it ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16975)). Issues related to a deprecated Discord faucet ([#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/12952)) and an old chain validation strategy ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/689), [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/696)) were also closed.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Local Development Tooling:** A new issue was opened to "Improve `op-up` so it can serve as a sysgo runner during development" ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17942)), directly supporting the move away from Kurtosis.
    - **Upgrade Preparations:** Discussions continue on preparing for the Fusaka upgrade, with tasks for `op-geth` ([#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/682)) and `superchain-ops` ([#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1206)) remaining open for Mainnet implementation.
    - **DA Footprint Limit:** The implementation of the DA Footprint Limit ([#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17551)) remains a key focus. A blocker related to a spec derivation issue ([#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17946)) saw progress, with the root cause identified and a fix proposed.
    - **Documentation Bugs:** Following the major documentation restructure, new issues were opened to address broken internal links ([#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1802)) and incorrect paths in `curl` commands ([#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1797)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in discussions around complex technical trade-offs. The active issue regarding `rollupConfig` compatibility for the Jovian upgrade ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17907)) highlights a careful debate on how to implement changes without breaking compatibility for other ecosystem projects, such as zk stacks. Furthermore, the progress on the DA Footprint Limit issue ([#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17551)) demonstrates effective cross-repository coordination, as the blocker was identified and addressed in the core `optimism` repository. The concerted effort to close numerous outdated issues suggests strong project coordination and a focus on clearing the path for future development priorities.
