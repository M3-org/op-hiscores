# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing documentation quality and advancing the project's testing capabilities. A significant undertaking was the systematic replacement of Etherscan links with Blockscout URLs across the documentation, ensuring consistency for users of OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia. Key documentation was also added for node operators, and several long-standing issues concerning sequencer stability were closed. Concurrently, important discussions progressed on improving test infrastructure, including a new initiative to align the local testnet topology with the production environment for more realistic E2E testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on documentation consistency, accuracy, and providing critical information for node operators.

- **Standardization of Explorer Links**
  A major effort was completed to standardize block explorer links throughout the documentation ([#1693](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1693)). This involved replacing all Etherscan references with Blockscout for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia, improving consistency and user experience across pages related to app development, the Superchain, and the OP Stack.

- **Node Operator and Contract Upgrade Documentation**
  The documentation was updated to include details on the `p2p.sync.onlyreqtostatic` flag, a new configuration for node operators to restrict syncing to static peers ([#1688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1688)). Additionally, a minor but important fix was made to the `deploy_config.json` in the contract upgrade guide ([#1692](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1692)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved closing out a batch of older issues and opening new ones focused on improving test environment parity.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Sequencer Stability & Node Operations:** Several older issues related to sequencer stability, including recovery from sequence window expiration ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/11228)) and halting from temporary errors ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/12240)), were closed as resolved or no longer relevant. An issue regarding a deprecated NPM package ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/13459)) and a resolved node startup problem ([#15411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15411)) were also closed.
  - **Test Resolution:** An issue causing interop acceptance test failures was resolved ([#16731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16731)), and another related to basic interop test functionality was transferred to the Protocol team for resolution ([#298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/298)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Test Environment Parity:** A key new issue ([#16746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16746)) was opened to address discrepancies between the local Kurtosis interop devnet and the production environment. The goal is to make the acceptance test topology more realistic by adding `proxyd` and `verifier` nodes and correctly configuring the sequencer, which is currently causing test failures.
  - **Advanced Test Strategies:** Discussions continued on several fronts to enhance testing. This includes designing session management for the `op-sync-tester` service ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16452)) and defining a test plan for invalid interop transaction re-injection to ensure network resilience ([#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16656)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week saw active collaboration on complex technical challenges, particularly around testing and validation. Discussions on issues like the `op-sync-tester` ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16452)) and interop transaction testing ([#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16656)) involved detailed proposals and feedback from contributors like @protolambda and @pcw109550. The acknowledgment of a code duplication issue by @geoknee and the invitation for a community PR ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16677)) highlights a welcoming environment for contributions. Furthermore, the handoff of an issue to the Protocol team ([#298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/298)) demonstrates effective cross-team coordination.
