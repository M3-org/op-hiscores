# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Jul 6 - 12, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a strong focus on enhancing documentation quality and usability for chain operators. Significant progress was made in creating comprehensive guides for setting up proposers and batchers, alongside a concerted effort to standardize terminology and capitalization across the entire documentation suite. Preparations for the upcoming Upgrade 16 are now reflected in the docs, and a major strategic initiative was proposed to migrate the documentation platform to Mintlify, signaling a future investment in user experience. Concurrently, several technical issues were resolved, streamlining `op-node` functionality and improving test reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving documentation clarity, consistency, and operator support.

- **Chain Operator Enablement:** A major effort was made to improve the experience for those running their own OP Stack chains. This included a new tutorial for setting up a proposer post-configuration ([#1645]), a complete batcher deployment guide covering both source and Docker setups ([#1665]), and the addition of Holocene and Isthmus instructions to the consensus configuration docs ([#1686]).

- **Documentation Consistency and Maintenance:** A series of pull requests were merged to enforce consistency across the documentation. This involved standardizing the casing of terms like "cross-chain" ([#1672]), "Superchain" ([#1677]), "L2ToL2" ([#1678]), "Blockspace Charters" ([#1679]), and "L1 Date Fee" ([#1680]). Additionally, Grove was added as an RPC Provider ([#1685]), and a broken link was fixed ([#1683]).

- **Upgrade 16 Preparation:** As Upgrade 16 approaches, the documentation was updated to reflect its changes ([#1690]). A new pull request was also opened to add the specific execution date for the upgrade ([#1689]).

- **Future Platform Migration:** A significant new pull request ([#1691]) was opened to migrate the documentation site to Mintlify. This represents a potential major overhaul of the documentation platform aimed at improving its structure and user experience.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on closing out lingering technical items and continuing discussions on complex active issues. No new issues were opened.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Interop and Node Logic:** Two key issues related to interoperability were closed. The proposal to add a pre-Interop logic mode to `op-node` ([#16520]) was de-prioritized. The issue regarding pre-interop state checks in the execution client ([#15765]) was also closed, with the conclusion that the risk is better mitigated through improved genesis generation tooling like `op-deployer`.
    - **Test Reliability & Maintenance:** An issue concerning the reliability of acceptance tests was closed after significant improvements were made ([#16378]). An older `op-batcher` issue was also closed due to inactivity ([#15355]).
    - **Runbook Finalization:** The final review for the v3 fault proof incident runbook was completed and the issue was closed ([#16651]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Abnormal `op-geth` CPU Usage ([#613]):** This remains a notable active issue, with users continuing to report high CPU usage. A recent comment provided a `pprof` file for analysis, suggesting the performance problem might be related to a lengthy index update.
    - **Fault Proof Contract Changes ([#15789]):** Discussion continues on necessary OPCM changes for the Fault Proof creator contract. A detailed checklist of remaining tasks indicates this is a significant ongoing effort.
    - **Precompile Address Initialization ([#16620]):** A discussion was clarified this week, explaining that the 1 wei balance in precompile addresses (0x00-0xff) is expected behavior within the OP Stack to prevent them from being treated as empty accounts.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's activity highlighted a pattern of focused, internal collaboration on documentation and resolving technical debt. The series of consistency-focused PRs suggests a coordinated cleanup effort.

Discussions on closed issues, such as the decision to rely on tooling improvements for genesis validation ([#15765]), demonstrate a pragmatic approach to engineering, with maintainers carefully considering the appropriate layer for different system checks. The clarification provided by `tynes` on the precompile address issue ([#16620]) is a good example of maintainers engaging with the community to explain core functionalities of the stack. While there were no major new community-driven features, the work on operator guides and the proposed migration to Mintlify show a strong commitment to improving the developer and operator experience.
