# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Jun 1 - 7, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity was centered on critical discussions rather than code merges. While development on the documentation itself was limited to a new pull request for the data glossary, significant progress was made in issue discussions concerning the `op-supervisor` and fault proof system. Key conversations focused on resolving challenges with non-genesis interop upgrades and improving L1 origin validity handling, highlighting a preparatory phase for upcoming devnet migrations and protocol enhancements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The sole development this week was a documentation enhancement.
- A new pull request, [#1651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1651), was opened to update the data glossary.

No new features, bug fixes, or other code changes were merged during this period.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week. The focus remained on diagnosing and planning solutions for several complex, active issues.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Fault Proofs for Non-Genesis Interop:** Discussions continued on [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16166), addressing how the `op-supervisor` provides data for fault proofs. The core issue is that `op-challenger` does not fully support non-genesis interop upgrades. A proposed solution to have the supervisor index its safe DB from the very first block it receives is currently being implemented, as this is considered a crucial fix before proceeding with devnets.
  - **L1 Origin Validity in `op-supervisor`:** In [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16315), the conversation centered on improving how the `op-supervisor` handles L1 origin validity during resets. The consensus is shifting towards having the supervisor ensure all provided targets are valid, simplifying the logic in `op-node` and making the reset process more robust against L1 chain changes.
  - **Incorrect Nonce Bug:** Users are seeking updates on [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/623), where `eth_getTransactionCount` reportedly returns an incorrect nonce for pending transactions, causing them to become stuck.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was concentrated within the issue tracker, with team members engaging in deep technical discussions to architect solutions for core protocol components. The active dialogue around the `op-supervisor`'s behavior in issues [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16166) and [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16315) demonstrates a focused effort on ensuring the stability and correctness of the fault proof system ahead of future network upgrades.
