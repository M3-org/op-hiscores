# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a major push to enhance documentation for core Superchain functionalities. Significant progress was made with the addition of a comprehensive tutorial for upgrading ERC-20 tokens for Superchain interoperability and the introduction of detailed documentation for Flashblocks. Alongside these content additions, the team focused on internal process refinement by closing outdated issues, improving documentation workflows, and planning for Q4 audits. Discussions around tooling, particularly the migration of `op-deployer` to Forge, saw notable community engagement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused heavily on creating and refining documentation to support developers and chain operators within the Superchain ecosystem.

- **Superchain Interoperability Documentation:** A key achievement was the addition of a new tutorial on upgrading existing ERC-20 tokens for Superchain interoperability ([#1577](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1577)). This guide provides crucial steps for contract upgrades and custom bridging. The Superchain operations guide was also updated with new information ([#1725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1725)).

- **Flashblocks Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation for Flashblocks was introduced ([#1716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1716)), creating new resources that detail its features and use cases for both application developers and chain operators.

- **General Maintenance & Refinements:** The project's font assets were updated to "Reforma" ([#1723](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1723)), and a minor bug fix removed a reference to a deprecated SDK, ensuring documentation accuracy ([#1724](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1724)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:** A significant amount of housekeeping was completed.
    - **Process & Housekeeping:** Several issues were closed to streamline processes, including those related to `op-up` logging cleanup ([#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17007)), event system tracing ([#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16874)), and enforcing PR titles for better clarity ([#1675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1675), [#1728](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1728)).
    - **Deprioritized & Resolved:** The task to add Flashblocks support in Kurtosis was closed as deprioritized ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16514)), and a tracking issue for Jovian + Karst consensus was closed as it will not be implemented for now ([#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/13543)).
    - **Audit & Postmortems:** An issue tracking a 2024 Q4 audit was closed ([#1722](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1722)), as was a postmortem for a Scalar fix ([#17012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17012)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Future Work & Planning:** New issues were opened to track 2024 Q4 audit requirements ([#1722](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1722), [#1727](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1727)), signaling a focus on upcoming verification work.
    - **Tooling & CI Discussions:** Active discussions continued on several key technical issues. A major overhaul of the `op-deployer` documentation is underway ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1530)), with a "rich PR" in review. Relatedly, a series of issues tracking the migration of the deployer to Forge ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17213) and others) has attracted significant community interest. There is also an ongoing discussion about the best approach for running the monorepo CI suite on `op-geth` PRs to ensure compatibility ([#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/665)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong community interest in contributing to core tooling. A series of issues related to migrating the `op-deployer` to use Forge ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17213) - [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17218)) saw a community member, `tooshiNoko`, proactively express a desire to take on the entire set of tasks, demonstrating a high level of engagement. Additionally, ongoing technical discussions in issues like the `op-deployer` documentation overhaul ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1530)) and `op-geth` CI integration ([#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/665)) show healthy collaboration between team members and the wider community to solve complex technical challenges.
