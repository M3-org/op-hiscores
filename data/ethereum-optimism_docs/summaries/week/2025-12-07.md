# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push to enhance the documentation for node and chain operators. Major refactoring efforts reorganized and clarified configuration guides, JSON-RPC references, and network design examples to improve usability. The local development experience was also streamlined by simplifying the devnet setup. While documentation saw substantial improvements, a noteworthy challenge emerged from active discussions around node synchronization failures, indicating potential issues with L1 execution client interactions that are affecting operators across multiple chains.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The majority of work focused on restructuring and improving documentation for technical users, alongside critical bug fixes and repository maintenance.

-   **Node Operator Documentation Overhaul:** A major effort was undertaken to improve the clarity and structure of documentation for node operators. This included a significant refactoring of configuration guides into client-specific pages ([#1916]), splitting the JSON-RPC documentation into separate sections for `op-geth` and `op-node` ([#1905]), and updating the network design example with detailed configurations for sequencers and Tx Ingress Nodes ([#1913]).

-   **Streamlined Development and Deployment:** To improve the developer experience, P2P functionality was disabled by default in the `create-l2-rollup-example` devnet setup, resolving common warnings during local deployment ([#1906]). Additionally, the `op-deployer` documentation was ported from the monorepo to provide a centralized and updated resource ([#1911]).

-   **Bug Fixes and Maintenance:** A critical bug was fixed to correct redirects across numerous documentation sections, ensuring accurate user navigation ([#1907]). General repository maintenance included refactoring documentation files and removing outdated templates and CODEOWNERS files to improve maintainability ([#1909], [#1912]). A minor update was also made to the dRPC provider link ([#1908]).

-   **New Resources & Proposals:** A new faucet, `ethfaucet.com`, was added to the documentation ([#1917]). New proposals were opened to add documentation for Custom Gas Token v2 ([#1914]) and to update guides for launching an OP Stack chain ([#1915]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving documentation gaps for operators and diagnosing widespread node synchronization problems.

-   **Closed Issues:** Several issues related to operator documentation were resolved. This includes closing issues after adding an `op-reth` section ([#1893]), updating `op-deployer` documentation ([#1769]), and splitting the JSON-RPC API reference ([#1773]). An issue regarding non-problematic warnings during devnet deployment was also clarified and closed ([#1898]).

-   **New & Active Issues:** The most critical ongoing discussion revolves around node synchronization failures ([#18510], [#18581]). Multiple users reported "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors across Optimism, Base, and other chains, particularly when syncing from snapshots. The errors suggest the L1 Execution Client may not be providing necessary state data to the Op-Node, with discussions pointing towards potential client configuration issues or the need for a client update. Other active issues show community members offering to contribute to a `replica-healthcheck` for `op-rbuilder` ([#17685]) and batcher code simplification ([#18479]).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week saw strong community engagement, particularly in identifying and troubleshooting complex technical issues. The active discussions around node synchronization problems ([#18581]) demonstrate a collaborative effort between users running nodes on different chains and project maintainers to diagnose a shared problem. Furthermore, a community member named "Himess" proactively offered to take on two separate technical tasks: simplifying batcher code ([#18479]) and implementing a replica healthcheck ([#17685]), signaling a healthy and engaged contributor community.
