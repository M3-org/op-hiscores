# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant overhaul of the documentation for node operators and developers. Key efforts included porting the `op-deployer` documentation, refactoring node configuration guides for clarity, and splitting complex topics like JSON-RPC into client-specific sections. These improvements aim to streamline the experience for those running nodes and building on the OP Stack. While documentation quality improved, a notable new issue emerged concerning widespread node synchronization problems, suggesting potential client compatibility challenges across the Superchain ecosystem that are now under active discussion.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The week's development focused heavily on improving documentation structure, clarity, and content for core technical audiences.

**Node Operator & Devnet Documentation Overhaul**
A major effort was made to enhance the documentation for node operators and those setting up local development environments.
*   The node operator configuration documentation was significantly refactored to improve usability, with deprecated files removed and guides reorganized into client-specific pages ([#1916](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1916)).
*   To improve clarity, the JSON-RPC documentation was split into separate, dedicated sections for `op-geth` and `op-node` ([#1905](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1905)).
*   For local development, P2P was disabled by default in devnet examples to simplify the setup process ([#1906](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1906)).
*   Network design examples were updated with detailed sequencer and transaction ingress node configurations, complete with new diagrams ([#1913](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1913)).

**Content Expansion & Refactoring**
New content was added and existing documentation was restructured for better maintainability.
*   Comprehensive documentation for `op-deployer`, covering installation, usage, and architecture, was ported from the monorepo to the main docs site ([#1911](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1911)).
*   A broad refactoring pass improved consistency across various files, including style guides, contribution guidelines, and developer guides ([#1909](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1909)).
*   Repository maintenance was simplified by removing old issue templates and CODEOWNERS files ([#1912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1912)).

**Bug Fixes & Minor Updates**
*   A critical bug fix corrected redirects across numerous documentation sections, including app-developers, chain-operators, and the op-stack, ensuring accurate user navigation ([#1907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1907)).
*   The dRPC product name and link were updated in the RPC providers reference documentation ([#1908](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1908)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
This week saw the resolution of several documentation-related issues and the emergence of a significant new operational challenge for node operators.

**Closed Issues:**
The documentation enhancements completed this week directly addressed several outstanding issues:
*   **Node Operator Docs:** Issues requesting the porting of `op-deployer` docs ([#1769](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1769)), the splitting of JSON-RPC API docs ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1773)), the restoration of environment variable documentation ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1874)), and the addition of an `op-reth` section ([#1893](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1893)) were all resolved.
*   **Devnet Warnings:** An issue clarifying that certain warnings during devnet deployment are non-problematic was closed, as the behavior is expected when P2P is enabled locally ([#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1898)).

**New & Active Issues:**
*   **Node Synchronization Problems:** A critical new issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581)) was opened regarding nodes failing to synchronize. Users across multiple OP Stack chains (Base, Optimism, Unichain) reported "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. Community discussion points towards a potential issue with a recent client update, highlighting a significant operational challenge for node operators across the ecosystem.
*   **Ongoing Discussions:** Discussions continued on implementing a `replica-healthcheck` for `op-rbuilder` ([#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17685)) and simplifying batcher code ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18479)), with community members expressing interest in contributing to both.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was evident in both identifying problems and offering solutions. The new node synchronization issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18581)) saw rapid collaboration, with multiple users providing detailed reports and diagnostic information from various chains, demonstrating the community's role as a first line of defense in detecting systemic issues. Furthermore, community members showed initiative by volunteering to take on active issues, such as the `replica-healthcheck` for `op-rbuilder` ([#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17685)) and a batcher code simplification task ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18479)).
