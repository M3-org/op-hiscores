# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by maintenance, administrative cleanup, and preparation for future documentation efforts. While only one minor bug fix was merged, significant activity occurred in issue tracking and planning. The team closed out several monthly metrics reports and a past audit issue, clearing the way for new work. Notably, discussions around the `MinBaseFee` feature intensified, culminating in the creation of a new issue to begin its documentation, signaling a key focus for the upcoming period.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Activity this week focused on minor fixes and initiating new documentation updates.

- **Documentation Bug Fixes:** A pull request ([#1709](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1709)) was merged to fix a broken link to the sequencer guide within the `spin-batcher` documentation, improving user navigation.
- **Work in Progress:** Two new pull requests were opened to enhance developer resources: one providing quick fixes for Nethermind documentation ([#1704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1704)) and another updating the L2 rollup testnet tutorial ([#1705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved closing out administrative tasks and initiating documentation for new features.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Administrative Cleanup:** June 2025 monthly metrics reports for pull requests and issues were closed ([#1681](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1681), [#1682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1682)), along with a tracking issue for a Q4 2024 page path audit ([#1701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1701)).
    - **Documentation Clarity:** A long-standing issue ([#1401](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1401)) regarding confusion over L1 contract deployment in the L2 Testnet Tutorial was closed, indicating the relevant documentation has been clarified.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Future Documentation:** A new issue ([#1710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1710)) was created to begin documenting the `MinBaseFee` feature, marking the start of a significant documentation effort. New issues were also opened to track July's monthly metrics ([#1707](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1707), [#1708](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1708)).
    - **Min Base Fee Implementation:** Discussion continues on the `MinBaseFee` tracking issue ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16807)), with comments highlighting active, cross-repository development in `reth`, `op-alloy`, and `optimism`. This indicates significant coordination on a core protocol feature.
    - **Congestion Cost Proposal:** A discussion on congestion-based builder transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/306)) saw renewed interest, with a community member offering to collaborate on the design.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
While the volume of merged contributions was low, collaboration was evident in ongoing technical discussions. The active conversation around the `MinBaseFee` feature ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16807)) demonstrates strong cross-team coordination between different parts of the Optimism ecosystem. Additionally, the offer of collaboration on the congestion-cost proposal ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/306)) highlights community engagement in complex, forward-looking protocol design.
