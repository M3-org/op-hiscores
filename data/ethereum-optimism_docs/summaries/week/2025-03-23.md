# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Mar 23 - 29, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's focus was on improving the developer experience for external chain operators building on the OP Stack. A significant new issue was raised to address outdated and confusing documentation for creating a rollup testnet. This sparked a critical discussion around the `op-deployer` tool, revealing technical details about its current implementation of fault-proof systems and its impact on RPC usage. The work initiated aims to streamline the onboarding process for new chains joining the Superchain ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, development work this week centered on identifying and scoping documentation improvements rather than merging new features. An in-progress pull request ([#1539](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1539)) was noted as part of the effort to clarify the deployment process for OP Stack rollups.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week's activity was driven by a new issue concerning the documentation for OP Stack testnet deployment.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **OP Stack Rollup Testnet Documentation ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1530)):** A new issue was opened to create clear, updated documentation for setting up a testnet using `op-deployer`. The current documentation was identified as a blocker for external chain operators, as it mixes old manual deployment methods with the newer, preferred tool.
  - The active discussion on this issue revealed several key technical points:
    - `op-deployer` currently only deploys the permissioned dispute game (game type 1) and uses a placeholder for the absolute prestate hash.
    - A user observed a high number of `eth_call` RPC requests when using the permissioned fault-proof system, suggesting a potential source of high operational costs.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was centered around issue [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1530), demonstrating a healthy feedback loop between the community and project maintainers. A user provided valuable, real-world feedback by reporting high RPC usage, which led to a deeper technical discussion about the `op-deployer`'s behavior. This interaction highlights the community's active role in identifying pain points and improving the tooling for the broader Superchain ecosystem.
