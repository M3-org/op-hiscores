# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were centered on documentation enhancements, significant issue resolution, and strategic planning. While direct merges focused on improving documentation for analytics tools and upgrade communications, a major effort began to restructure the documentation's information architecture. The team made substantial progress by closing out a cluster of issues related to the Data Availability (DA) Footprint feature, Flashblocks RPC coordination, and sequencer configurations. Concurrently, active discussions on core components like `op-dispute-mon` and operator fee calculations signal ongoing refinement of the protocol, while new issues were created to prepare for the upcoming 2024 Q4 audit.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on both immediate documentation improvements and foundational restructuring for future clarity.

- **Documentation Content Updates:**
  - The documentation for analytics tools was updated to reflect changes related to Dune, ensuring accuracy for developers ([#1784](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1784)).
  - A minor but important update was made to the U16a upgrade communications, correcting the Base execution time ([#1776](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1776)).

- **New Documentation & Restructuring Efforts:**
  - A significant initiative to overhaul the documentation's structure was kicked off with two new pull requests ([#1791](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1791), [#1792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1792)).
  - New content is in progress to add SUPRA Oracle and VRF information to the oracle documentation ([#1788](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1788)).
  - A fix was proposed for a genesis config file naming issue in the quick start tutorial to improve the developer onboarding experience ([#1787](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1787)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of several key technical issues and the start of planning for the Q4 audit.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Data Availability (DA) Footprint:** A group of issues related to the DA Footprint Limit was closed, marking progress towards feature completion. This included updating the specification to use the `blobBaseFee` header field ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/792)) and confirming the addition of acceptance and unit tests in the `optimism` and `op-geth` repositories ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17278), [#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17395)).
  - **RPC & Sequencer Management:** Coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers for a new node was successfully completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17857)), and an issue regarding lost Flashblocks was resolved by recent upgrades ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17856)). Additionally, a Sepolia sequencer configuration was adjusted by updating the voter set ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17683)).
  - **Dispute Game:** An issue regarding the v2 dispute game implementation was closed, though it was later reopened due to a remaining `TODO` in the code ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17257)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **2024 Q4 Audit Prep:** Two new issues ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1789), [#1790](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1790)) were opened to track documentation updates required for the upcoming audit, signaling a focus on security and specification clarity.
  - **Dispute Monitor Synchronization:** A key technical discussion continued in [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17814) on how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync rollup RPCs. The debate centers on the best method to determine if a node is sufficiently synced to participate in a dispute game, weighing the risks of trusting the highest block versus verifying against L1 state.
  - **Operator Fee Calculation:** An ongoing review in [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17888) is exploring whether saturating math is necessary in the operator fee getter, a change that could simplify the logic.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
- The detailed discussion on `op-dispute-mon`'s behavior ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17814)) showcases deep collaboration between contributors to address a nuanced protocol-level challenge.
- In issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17686), a maintainer provided clear guidance to a new contributor regarding issue scope and the contribution process, helping to onboard them effectively into the project's workflow.
- The closure of issues related to the DA Footprint Limit and sequencer configuration highlights effective cross-repository work, with changes being implemented in the `optimism`, `op-geth`, and `k8s` repositories to resolve issues tracked within the `docs` project.
