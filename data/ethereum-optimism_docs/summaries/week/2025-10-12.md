# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity focused on initiating new documentation improvements and engaging in deep technical discussions on active issues, rather than completing and merging work. Two new pull requests were opened to enhance the documentation by fixing a tutorial configuration and adding a new oracle provider. Concurrently, significant progress was made in architectural discussions, particularly around refining the sync-checking logic for `op-dispute-mon` and clarifying the implementation scope for replica healthcheck monitoring.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No pull requests were merged or major features completed during this period. However, new work was initiated to improve documentation accuracy and completeness:

- **Tutorial and Oracle Documentation Updates:** Two pull requests were opened to enhance developer resources. [#1787](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1787) aims to fix an incorrect genesis config file name in the quick start tutorial, improving the onboarding experience. Additionally, [#1788](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1788) proposes adding SUPRA Oracle and VRF to the oracles documentation, expanding the list of available tools for developers.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were created and no existing issues were closed this week. The focus remained on resolving complex, active issues through community discussion.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`op-dispute-mon` Sync Logic:** Discussions on issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17814) progressed, addressing how `op-dispute-mon` handles out-of-sync rollup RPCs. The conversation moved towards a more robust solution: instead of trusting the highest L2 block, the monitor should use the `syncStatus` to check if a node has processed the relevant L1 block for a given dispute game. This ensures a node is sufficiently in sync to provide valid data, preventing false disagreements.
    - **Replica Healthcheck Scope:** On issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17686), a contributor's pull request for replica healthcheck monitoring was clarified to be out of scope for `op-conductor`. A maintainer explained that this functionality is an infrastructure-level concern, providing valuable architectural guidance and encouraging the contributor to re-engage after discussion and assignment.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted constructive collaboration between maintainers and contributors on complex technical issues. The detailed discussion on `op-dispute-mon` ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17814)) between contributors `ajsutton` and `pauldowman` demonstrates a collaborative effort to refine a critical monitoring component. Furthermore, the interaction on [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17686) showed healthy community dynamics, with maintainer `yashvardhan-kukreja` providing clear, supportive feedback to contributor `CreeptoGengar`, guiding them on project scope and contribution best practices.
