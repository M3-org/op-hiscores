# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on refining documentation, resolving outstanding infrastructure issues, and laying the groundwork for future initiatives. Key progress was made in closing issues related to Data Availability (DA) footprint limits, Flashblocks RPC coordination, and sequencer configurations. While direct code contributions were minimal, significant new pull requests were opened proposing a major documentation restructure. Discussions on critical components like `op-dispute-mon`'s synchronization logic continued, highlighting the project's focus on protocol security and robustness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on targeted documentation improvements to ensure accuracy for developers and node operators.

- **Documentation Enhancements:** Updates were made to keep the documentation in sync with the ecosystem. This included updating the Base execution time for U16a communications ([#1776](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1776)) and refining the `analytics-tools.mdx` page to reflect changes related to Dune ([#1784](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1784)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a significant push to close existing issues while opening new ones for planned work, indicating a shift from resolving old tasks to preparing for new ones.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Infrastructure & Operations:** Several key operational issues were resolved. Coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers was successfully completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17857)), a Flashblocks loss issue was attributed to recent upgrades ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17856)), and a sequencer configuration on Sepolia was adjusted ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17683)).
    - **Data Availability (DA) Footprint:** Progress was made on the DA footprint limit, with the closure of an issue confirming the spec update to use the `blobBaseFee` header field ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/792)). Related issues for acceptance and unit tests were also closed, with work completed in the `optimism` and `op-geth` repositories ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17278), [#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17395)).
    - **Housekeeping:** Monthly metrics reports for September were closed ([#1777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1777), [#1778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1778)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Documentation Restructure & Audits:** Two new pull requests ([#1791](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1791), [#1792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1792)) were opened, signaling a significant upcoming information architecture restructure. In preparation for the 2024 Q4 audit, two new issues were created to track required documentation updates ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1789), [#1790](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1790)).
    - **Dispute Monitor Synchronization:** A critical discussion continues in [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17814) regarding `op-dispute-mon`'s behavior with out-of-sync nodes. The debate focuses on whether to trust the highest L2 block or use the `syncStatus` to verify a node has processed the relevant L1 block, a key consideration for the security of dispute games.
    - **Sequencer Operations:** A new issue was reported concerning an `op-conductor` startup failure after linking to a previously deployed sequencer ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17899)), requiring maintainer assistance.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was evident in both maintenance and new contributions.

- **Technical Collaboration:** The ongoing discussion around `op-dispute-mon` ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17814)) showcases deep collaboration between core contributors on complex protocol details.
- **Guiding New Contributors:** In issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17686), a maintainer provided clear guidance to a community member on project scope and the contribution process, fostering a healthy and welcoming environment for future contributions.
- **Ecosystem Contributions:** New pull requests were opened to add information about SUPRA Oracle ([#1788](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1788)) and to fix a tutorial ([#1787](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1787)), demonstrating the community's active role in keeping the documentation accurate and comprehensive.
