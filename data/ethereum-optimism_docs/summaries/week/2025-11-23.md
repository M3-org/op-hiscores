# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Nov 23 - 29, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week saw a dual focus on immediate documentation health and long-term strategic planning for the Proofs system. The first half of the week was dedicated to maintenance, with contributors successfully resolving numerous broken links, correcting outdated Docker image references, and improving overall clarity. The latter half shifted to deep architectural discussions around ZK proof generation, challenger strategies, and dispute game dependencies. This blend of tactical fixes and strategic foresight ensures the documentation remains accurate for current users while paving the way for future protocol enhancements.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The week's completed work centered on improving the accuracy and usability of the documentation for developers and operators.

*   **Documentation Maintenance and Accuracy:**
    *   A series of fixes were merged to enhance documentation quality. This included improving clarity in the compatible tokens reference ([#1885](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1885)), correcting outdated Docker image references on the node releases page ([#1886](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1886)), and fixing a wide range of broken links and redirects, particularly within the `chain-operators` guides ([#1888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1888)).
*   **New Documentation Efforts:**
    *   A new pull request was opened to update the documentation and default settings for batcher throttling, reflecting ongoing refinements to the system ([#1889](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1889)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Discussions this week were dominated by architectural decisions for the Proofs system and investigation into a critical sequencer bug.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   The integration of `op-reth` into acceptance tests was confirmed, resolving a key infrastructure issue ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17475)).
    *   An older issue requesting documentation updates for MOVE token staking and governance was closed ([#1674](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1674)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **ZK Proofs and Challenger Strategy:** Significant discussion occurred across several issues ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18319), [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18322), [#18325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18325)) regarding the implementation of ZK proofs. Key points include the decision to generate ZK proofs in the Rust challenger due to dependencies and the potential for `op-challenger` to handle the more straightforward challenge logic.
    *   **Dispute Game Architecture:** A discussion on refining the `AnchorStateRegistry` dependency ([#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18347)) explored ways to ensure the correct registry is used without over-complicating the interface.
    *   **`op-node` Sequencer Bug:** Investigation continues into a potential bug in the `op-node`'s sequencer recover mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18350)). Contributors are analyzing why the sequencer might stall when it reaches the chain tip, potentially violating the sequencer drift rule.
    *   **Runbook Documentation:** Progress was made on documenting the runbook routing process for the Proofs system ([#18372](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18372)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week highlighted strong collaboration among core contributors on complex technical designs. The detailed discussions around the ZK Proofs system and dispute games, primarily led by `Inphi` with input from `Ajsutton`, demonstrate a focused effort on architecting the next generation of the protocol. Similarly, the collaborative debugging on the `op-node` sequencer issue between `sebastianst` and `geoknee` shows a proactive approach to maintaining protocol stability. Community engagement was also visible, with contributor `yasnazariel` stepping up to address outstanding documentation issues related to Docker images and environment variables ([#1657](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1657), [#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1874)).
