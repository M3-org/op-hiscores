# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push to improve documentation quality and completeness. A major effort was undertaken to correct typos and grammatical errors across the entire documentation suite, enhancing clarity for developers and operators. Key configuration guides for `minBaseFee` and `DA Footprint` were added, providing crucial information for chain operators. While documentation updates were the primary focus of completed work, important technical discussions progressed on improving the robustness of core components like `proxyd` and `op-batcher`, signaling a continued focus on protocol stability and performance.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The week's completed work centered on refining and expanding the existing documentation.

- **Widespread Documentation Quality Improvements:** A large-scale effort was made to enhance the readability and professionalism of the documentation. Over a dozen pull requests were merged to fix typos and grammatical errors across nearly every section, including guides for app developers ([#1839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1839), [#1841](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1841), [#1842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1842)), chain operators ([#1836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1836), [#1837](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1837)), node operators ([#1845](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1845)), and conceptual architecture docs ([#1843](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1843), [#1844](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1844)). A comprehensive review also fixed issues across multiple files ([#1835](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1835)).

- **New Configuration Guides:** In a key update for chain operators, new documentation sections for `minBaseFee` and `DA Footprint` were added to the rollup configuration guide ([#1830](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1830)). This work corresponds to the closure of issues tracking this documentation effort.

- **Technical Clarifications & Maintenance:**
    - The documentation was updated to clarify the behavior of sender address modification for L1 to L2 transactions, particularly concerning smart contracts and EIP-7702 delegation ([#1828](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1828)).
    - Housekeeping tasks included adding missing data pages ([#1832](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1832]), archiving older upgrade notices ([#1840](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1840)), and adding a redirect for EAS documentation ([#1831](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1831)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Fee-Related Documentation:** The primary issues closed this week were related to the completion of documentation for the `MinBaseFee` feature ([#1710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1710)) and the `DA Footprint Limit` ([#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1742)), which were tracked concurrently.
    - **Technical Debt & Dependencies:** A long-standing issue regarding unused acceptance tests was closed as the team has moved to a different testing mode ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16273)). A broken dependency in `op-chain-ops` was also resolved ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16612)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - Discussions this week highlighted ongoing challenges in core OP Stack components. A key conversation around `proxyd` ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/501)) explored strategies to handle out-of-sync backends and prevent "backwards time travel" for requests like `eth_call` and `eth_estimateGas`.
    - The `op-batcher` was the subject of two significant discussions. One focused on improving blob priority fee tracking ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18102)), with suggestions for a "decaying" priority fee as a short-term fix. The other addressed the brittleness of the `op-batcher` fetching its rollup config from `op-node` only at startup ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18178)), with proposals to make the dependency more explicit or to trigger reloads on endpoint changes.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week saw a highly coordinated effort, particularly visible in the large volume of documentation quality fixes merged on a single day. This suggests a focused "sprint" or a strong community emphasis on improving the polish and accessibility of the project's resources. Furthermore, active issue discussions, such as the one on `op-batcher` configuration ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18178)), demonstrate collaborative problem-solving between team members on complex architectural decisions. The decision to track related documentation issues ([#1710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1710), [#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1742)) together also points to efficient project management and coordination.
