# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Sep 21 - 27, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on documentation enhancements and critical discussions shaping future development. Key progress included updates to operator setup guides and preparations for the U16a upgrade. A strategic decision was made to close an issue related to `op-test-sequencer` integration, reflecting a shift away from Kurtosis. Meanwhile, active discussions advanced planning for the Fusaka upgrade, improvements to the `superchain-ops` flow, and clarification of L2EL syncing behavior, setting the stage for upcoming work.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused exclusively on improving documentation for operators and developers.

- **Documentation Enhancements:** Two minor but important updates were merged. The operator setup guide was clarified in `op-deployer-setup.mdx` ([#1749](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1749)), and crucial chain operator information was added to the U16a upgrade notice ([#1751](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1751)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving a strategic dependency, identifying new areas for improvement, and continuing discussions on complex technical topics.

- **Closed Issues:** A significant issue regarding the integration of `op-test-sequencer` into the devnet environment was closed ([#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15265)). The closure was a strategic decision, as the team is "moving away from `kurtosis`."

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **New Issues Opened:**
        - A UI bug was reported where the theme-switcher button text is not visible in light mode ([#1752](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1752)).
        - An issue was opened to deduplicate Engine API validations in `Miner.prepareWork` ([#688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/688)).
        - An issue regarding `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` using default configurations was opened ([#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/685)) but was immediately noted as having been resolved by an upstream fix in `go-ethereum`.
    - **Noteworthy Active Discussions:**
        - **Superchain-ops Flow ([#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1224)):** A detailed discussion unfolded as @blmalone addressed feedback from @geoknee on improving the signing flow, clarifying task simulations and the role of `op-txverify`.
        - **Fusaka Upgrade Prep ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17472)):** To prepare `op-batcher` for Fusaka, @geoknee provided a recipe for manual testing, highlighting the need for the batcher to send blob transactions with cell proofs post-activation.
        - **L2EL Syncing ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17628)):** Discussion continued on the conditions for L2EL syncing, with @ajsutton clarifying that `op-geth` will sync to the new chain head regardless of its finalized status, simplifying the problem space.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. The back-and-forth between @blmalone and @geoknee on the `superchain-ops` flow ([#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1224)) exemplifies a healthy feedback loop. Contributors like @geoknee, @ajsutton, and @janjakubnanista were instrumental in providing technical direction and strategic context across several issues, from Fusaka preparation to clarifying core syncing mechanics.
