# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Sep 28 - 4, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by the finalization of major initiatives and a strong focus on improving the developer experience. The tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade was officially closed, marking a significant milestone. Work on the Flashblocks initiative also wrapped up, with the successful deployment of an RPC node, completion of load testing, and refinement of alerts. A key documentation enhancement ([#1775](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1775)) now provides developers with example code for creating L2 rollups. However, a significant blocker was identified in Cannon, where an incompatibility with Go 1.25 is preventing correct block hash calculations ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17060)).

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development this week focused on enhancing developer tooling and documentation to support builders on the OP Stack.

- **L2 Rollup Creation Documentation:** To improve the developer experience, documentation for creating L2 rollups was significantly enhanced. PR [#1775](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1775) added practical example code, including environment setup, a Makefile, Docker Compose files, and deployment scripts, to provide a clear, hands-on guide for setting up a new rollup. A new pull request for "U16a comms updates" ([#1776](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1776)) was also opened.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the closure of several long-standing items and the identification of a critical compatibility problem.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Initiative:** A cluster of issues related to Flashblocks was resolved, signaling the completion of this effort. This includes the deployment of a flashblocks-rpc node ([#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16764)), the documentation of load test results ([#17462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17462)), and the refinement of associated alerts and runbooks ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17423)).
    - **Protocol & Network Upgrades:** The main tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade was closed, confirming its completion ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/12703)). The investigation into L2EL sync conditions was also concluded ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17628)).
    - **Tooling & Planning:** An issue to improve `op-acceptance-test` reporting was closed ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/386)), and a proposal to refactor the `op-node` architecture was closed as "not planned" after an initial spike ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16680)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Process Improvement:** Two new issues were opened to track and report on September's contribution metrics for closed issues ([#1777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1777)) and pull requests ([#1778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1778)).
    - **Potential Blocker:** A critical issue in Cannon ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17060)) was highlighted, where Go 1.25 causes incorrect Keccak hash calculations, breaking block hash validation. The latest Go patch does not appear to resolve the underlying MIPS issue.
    - **Strategic Shift:** Discussion in [#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17475) indicates a change in strategy for `op-reth` integration, moving focus from the deprecated `jovian kt-devnet` to the `devstack / sysgo` system.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in technical discussions and strategic decision-making. The resolution of the L2EL sync conditions issue ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17628)) demonstrated effective problem-solving, with several contributors (@pcw109550, @ajsutton, @sebastianst) reaching a consensus. The decision to close the `op-node` refactoring issue ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16680)) after a spike shows a healthy process of exploration and deliberate planning, prioritizing impact over implementation.
