# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Aug 10 - 16, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week saw no new code contributions or merged pull requests. Instead, the focus was on strategic planning, discussion, and re-evaluation of existing work items. Key efforts involved reviving and tracking progress on testing infrastructure for the Superchain, including `op-challenger` and `op-sync-tester`. Additionally, significant discussions continued around future protocol enhancements like the Data Availability Footprint Limit and tooling upgrades such as Go 1.24 support in Cannon, indicating a period of groundwork for upcoming development cycles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features, bug fixes, or other code changes were merged into the repository this week. All development activity was centered on discussions and management of existing issues.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were created and no existing issues were closed this week. The primary activity involved re-opening and discussing existing issues to track necessary future work.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Testing Infrastructure:** A significant portion of the week's activity focused on bolstering testing capabilities. Issue [#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15948) was re-opened to continue work on `op-challenger` acceptance tests for interop chains, ensuring it can properly dispute invalid proposals. Similarly, [#16700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16700) was re-opened to track the implementation of `eth` namespace support in `op-sync-tester`.
    - **Protocol Design & Tooling:** Discussions continued on the Data Availability Footprint Limit design ([#17009](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17009)) and specification ([#17087](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17087)). The issue for adding Go 1.24 support in Cannon ([#14760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/14760)) was also re-opened to track progress.
    - **Strategic Deprioritization:** In the discussion for an "Event Call Graph" ([#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16874)), it was noted that the team is leaning towards removing the entire event system, making the associated PR unlikely to be merged.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was characterized by internal planning and strategic alignment rather than broad community contributions. Discussions were concentrated within specific issues, with team members like `mbaxter` and `pcw109550` re-opening issues to organize and track future work. The focused discussions on core protocol design and testing infrastructure suggest a period of internal coordination to prepare for the next phase of development.
