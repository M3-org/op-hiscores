# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 29, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant effort to overhaul the documentation's underlying infrastructure and improve content integrity. The team focused on migrating away from legacy systems by removing Netlify configurations and cleaning up leftover Nextra elements, streamlining the build process. This foundational work was complemented by extensive content reorganization, fixing broken links, and removing outdated references to Kurtosis. In parallel, important discussions progressed on active issues concerning third-party stack compatibility, L3 configuration, and test stability, signaling a dual focus on immediate quality improvements and future-proofing the ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The majority of development work centered on refining the documentation's structure, deployment process, and content accuracy.

- **Documentation Infrastructure Overhaul:** A major theme was the modernization of the documentation's technical foundation. This included the removal of the Netlify configuration file ([#1810](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1810)) and subsequent testing to confirm the change ([#1814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1814)). Further cleanup involved removing leftover Nextra elements from numerous pages ([#1812](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1812)) and purging all references to the outdated Kurtosis tooling ([#1817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1817)).

- **Content Reorganization and Link Integrity:** Significant effort was made to improve navigation and user experience. L1 contract upgrade documentation was moved to a more logical location within the `chain-operators/tutorials` section ([#1809](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1809)), and the main landing page and its assets were relocated ([#1813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1813)). A series of pull requests fixed broken internal links, added missing redirects, and restructured content across developer and operator guides ([#1805](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1805), [#1811](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1811), [#1820](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1820), [#1821](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1821)).

- **Documentation Cleanup:** To improve accuracy, a duplicated `L1_BEACON_URL` was removed from an example environment file, reducing redundancy for developers ([#1806](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1806)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened this week, but progress was made on closing existing ones and advancing discussions on key technical challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Documentation Audits:** Several issues related to a Q4 2024 audit were resolved, addressing incorrect page paths and other content fixes ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1789), [#1790](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1790), [#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1797)).
  - **Technical Debt:** An issue tracking broken internal links in tutorials was closed following the recent fixes ([#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1802)). An issue regarding the need for more `op-deployer` end-to-end testing was also closed, as recent CLI-level integration tests have addressed the concern ([#16842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16842)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Third-Party Compatibility:** A critical discussion continues in [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17907) regarding new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` that are breaking third-party zk stacks like `op-succinct`. This highlights the need for better versioning or clearer communication for RPC method changes affecting the ecosystem.
  - **L3 Configuration:** A proposal is being discussed in [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18070) to simplify L3 setups by having `op-node` automatically detect known L2 chain IDs and apply L3 behavior, improving the developer experience.
  - **Test Stability:** Discussions in [#18063](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18063) are focused on resolving race conditions in `op-devstack` acceptance tests by ensuring unique, isolated wallets are used for each test.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted collaboration with external teams and the broader community.
- The discussion around the `op-batcher` frame size for Celestia DA ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17796), [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17872)) involved reviewing a proposed fix from the Celestia team, who have been asked to open a PR.
- The impact of `rollupConfig` changes on third-party stacks ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17907)) underscores the project's role within a wider ecosystem and the importance of maintaining compatibility.
- An explicit invitation was made for community contributions to help fix broken links identified by the Mintlify linter ([#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1802)), encouraging broader participation in maintaining documentation quality.
