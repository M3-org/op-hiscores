# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing documentation for both developers and node operators. A significant expansion of the Actions SDK documentation provided developers with comprehensive new resources, while node operators benefited from a critical bug fix in the troubleshooting guide and the initiation of a new guide for setting the DA footprint. Additionally, the team prepared for the Jovian network upgrade by publishing new release notices, ensuring the community remains informed about important network changes.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on expanding developer resources, improving node operator guides, and preparing for a network upgrade.

- **Actions SDK Documentation Expansion:** A major update significantly expanded resources for developers using the Actions SDK. New reference pages were added to cover configuring actions, integrating wallets, and detailing the Wallet and Lend APIs, moving beyond the existing Quickstart guide to provide more in-depth material ([#1857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1857)).

- **Node Operator & Network Upgrade Documentation:**
    - **Jovian Upgrade:** New release notices for the Jovian upgrade were published, including updates for Fusaka and archived notices, to keep users informed ([#1860](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1860)).
    - **Node Troubleshooting:** A bug was fixed in the node troubleshooting guide to make unclean shutdowns visible, improving clarity for node operators managing their infrastructure ([#1854](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1854)).
    - **DA Footprint Guide:** Work began on a new guide explaining how to set the DA footprint ([#1858](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1858)).

- **Documentation Maintenance:** A minor bug fix corrected a link to the Jovian notice page within the minimum base fee guide, ensuring proper navigation ([#1859](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1859)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened this week, but progress was made on resolving existing ones and advancing discussions on key technical topics.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - One issue was closed ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17303)) after confirming that the necessary action tests for the Jovian upgrade were successfully added and are being run by Kona's CI, ensuring protocol readiness.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`op-node` Performance:** Discussion continued on optimizing `op-node`'s safe-head advancement to reduce "FCU spam" ([#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15393)). A recently merged pull request in the main Optimism repository was identified as a potential solution.
    - **Upgrade Documentation:** There is an agreement to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades, a key consideration for the upcoming U18 upgrade ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18095)).
    - **Batcher Safeguards:** Conversations are ongoing about improving safeguards for the batcher during SystemConfig updates, with connections made to a similar issue, highlighting a focus on system robustness ([#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18246)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Discussions within active issues demonstrated healthy collaboration. In issue [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18095), coordination between core developers and the devrel team was noted to ensure critical upgrade requirements are documented. Furthermore, contributors showed cross-repository awareness by referencing pull requests and related issues from the main `optimism` repository to inform discussions within the `docs` project.
