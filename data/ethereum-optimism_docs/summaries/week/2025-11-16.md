# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant focus on improving documentation structure and accuracy, alongside a major effort in backlog grooming. The team executed a broad refactoring of the site's navigation and restructured key guides for node operators to enhance clarity. Concurrently, a large number of older, stale issues related to node stability, testing, and deprecated features were closed, cleaning up the project's issue tracker. While new documentation gaps were identified, ongoing discussions on core components like `op-node`'s sync logic and `op-supervisor` signal a continued focus on the protocol's long-term health and evolution.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on refining the existing documentation for better usability and correctness.

- **Documentation Structure and Navigation:** A major refactoring of the documentation's navigation was completed to improve user experience and content discoverability across the app-developer, chain-operator, op-stack, and superchain sections ([#1872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1872)). In a similar vein, the snap sync documentation for node operators was restructured for better organization ([#1851](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1851)), and a new effort was started to combine community documentation ([#1879](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1879)).

- **Documentation Accuracy and Updates:** To ensure technical precision, a fix was merged to correct an `op-geth` tag in an upgrade guide ([#1877](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1877)). Additionally, notice pages were updated to include current Rust version information, keeping critical details aligned with the latest technical requirements ([#1878](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1878)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
A significant cleanup of the issue tracker occurred, with numerous issues being closed due to age, resolution in newer releases, or relation to deprecated features.
- **Node Stability & Testing:** Several long-standing issues concerning `op-node` stability ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16332)), state DB corruption ([#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/549)), and various flaky tests ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17966), [#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18138)) were closed.
- **Deprecated Features:** Issues related to the deprecated Kurtosis (KT) devnet were closed, including one for L2 network divergence ([#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/15782)).
- **Superchain Registry:** A set of issues related to the Superchain Registry 2.0 implementation were resolved, marking progress in refactoring and tooling updates ([#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/610), [#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/643), [#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/644)).
- **Feature Analysis:** The issue to conduct simulations for the `min-base-fee` feature was closed, with the team opting to observe its performance in production instead ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16958)).

### New & Active Issues
New issues highlight areas where documentation needs to be expanded, while active discussions point to significant future work.
- **New Documentation Gaps:** New issues were opened to address missing environment variable descriptions for `op-node` and `op-geth` ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1874)) and incomplete guidance in the batcher configuration documentation ([#1876](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1876)).
- **Active Discussions & Future Work:**
    - Several issues related to `op-node` sync logic ([#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16141)), `op-supervisor` refactoring ([#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16174)), and comment cleanup ([#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16917)) were reopened to formally track remaining TODOs.
    - Discussions continue on `op-node`'s EL Sync behavior ([#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/17631), [#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18124)), though these are not considered immediate blockers.
    - The need to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for chain upgrades is being actively addressed, with information being passed to the docs team ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18095)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week's activity highlighted a methodical approach to backlog management. A pattern emerged where one contributor (`mslipper`) reviewed the relevance of older issues, while another (`ajsutton`) ensured that any outstanding work from those issues was not lost by reopening them to track remaining TODOs. This demonstrates a collaborative and thorough process for maintaining the project's health. The discussion around the Fusaka-on-L2 design ([#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/355)) also noted a plan to check with customers, indicating a user-centric approach to feature development.
