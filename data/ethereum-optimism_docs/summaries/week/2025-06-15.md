# ethereum-optimism/docs Weekly Report (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This was a quiet week for the `ethereum-optimism/docs` repository, with no new pull requests merged or documentation changes implemented. The primary focus was on planning for future infrastructure enhancements. A new initiative was formally tracked to enable flashblocks on the op-sepolia testnet, signaling preparatory work for upcoming protocol features. This effort is currently in the planning phase and is dependent on the successful testing of related components.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Based on the available activity reports for this week, there were no new features, bug fixes, or documentation enhancements merged into the repository. Development work was paused or focused on planning rather than implementation.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week centered on laying the groundwork for a single, significant future task.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:** The main activity was the creation of a new issue to manage the deployment of flashblocks.
    - **Flashblocks on op-sepolia:** Issue [#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16496) was opened to track the process of enabling flashblocks on the op-sepolia testnet. The initial plan involves a non-public deployment in `dry_run` mode for testing. This work is currently blocked by another issue ([#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/16468)) and is contingent on gaining confidence from a similar enablement in the `eris-0` environment.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community interaction was minimal this week, with no pull request discussions or reviews taking place. The focus was on internal planning, as evidenced by the creation of the tracking issue for the flashblocks deployment.
