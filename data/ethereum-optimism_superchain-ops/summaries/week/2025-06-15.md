# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was primarily dedicated to strategic planning and technical discussions, laying the groundwork for future development and network upgrades. While code contributions were minimal, significant progress was made in defining CI/CD improvements, investigating node stability, and planning new features like flashblocks. The week's activity culminated in the first concrete steps toward the U16 mainnet upgrade, with the creation of necessary configuration and documentation files for several chains. This signals a shift from planning to execution for upcoming network tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The sole code contribution this week focused on preparing for a significant future network upgrade.

- **U16 Mainnet Upgrade Preparation:** In preparation for the U16 mainnet tasks, new configuration files and documentation were created via [#1047](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1047). This work includes `.env`, `README.md`, `VALIDATION.md`, and `config.toml` files to manage the enabling and removal of the Deposit Proxy Manager (DPM) and the upgrade of the Optimism Portal Contract Manager (OPCM) for the op-ink, soneium, uni, and base chains.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week. Activity was concentrated on discussions within new and existing issues, highlighting key areas of focus for the project.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **CI/CD & Release Automation:** A major theme was improving operational efficiency. A detailed proposal for CI Pipeline SLAs and an accountability framework was outlined in [#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16437) to establish clear performance targets. Discussions also continued in [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16097) on creating a one-click solution for generating consistent, high-quality release notes, potentially using `git-cliff`.
    - **Node Stability & Debugging:** Investigation continued into `op-node` stability, with users reporting stuck goroutines in `p2p.SyncClient` on v1.13.3 ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16332)). Separately, `op-supervisor` crashes due to event overflow were discussed in [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16335), with related PRs mentioned to add metrics for future debugging.
    - **Feature Planning & Interoperability:** Planning began for the non-public enablement of flashblocks on op-sepolia ([#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16496)). A new discussion emerged around a "trivial interop mode" for `op-node` ([#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16519)), raising questions about its impact on future upgrade paths for chains joining an interop cluster.
    - **Tooling & Specification:** Discussions in [#361](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/361) focused on making the dependency set in `supersim` configurable. Additionally, an issue was opened ([#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/725)) to address missing error codes for data availability reorgs in the Go implementation.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's activity was characterized by extensive discussion and collaborative planning across a range of strategic and technical issues. There was significant engagement on topics like CI/CD automation ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16097), [#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16437)) and node functionality ([#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16519)), indicating a collective effort to define project direction and improve developer experience. The discussions clarified the distinct roles of different tools, such as `supersim` for local development and Kurtosis for chain testing ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/399)), showcasing a focus on aligning the team's understanding of the development ecosystem.
