# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was dominated by the coordinated preparation and execution of the U16a upgrade across the Superchain. Significant progress was made in adding and validating upgrade tasks for numerous chains on both Sepolia and Mainnet, including Base, Optimism, Soneium, Ink, and Unichain. Several Sepolia-based chains like Zora, Metal, and Mode were successfully upgraded from U13 to U16. Alongside this major upgrade effort, the team enhanced developer tooling by improving `mise` and `op-acceptor`, resolved key issues related to Eris-0 network readiness, and initiated important architectural discussions around standardizing network upgrade transactions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on a major upgrade cycle while also delivering targeted improvements to tooling and protocol components.

### U16a Upgrade Rollout & Preparation
A massive, coordinated effort was undertaken to prepare the Superchain for the U16a upgrade, which includes the OPCM v410 update.
- **Task Creation & Readiness:** New tasks were created and set to "ready to sign" for the U16a upgrade on Sepolia for Base ([#1196]), Optimism, Soneium, Ink, and Unichain ([#1198], [#1202]). Preparations for Mainnet followed, with tasks added for the same set of chains ([#1201]).
- **Chain Upgrades Executed:** Several Sepolia chains were successfully upgraded, including Zora ([#1180]), Metal ([#1181]), and Mode ([#1182]) from U13 to U16, and Arena-Z ([#1194]) from U15 to U16a.
- **Bug Fixes & Templating:** A critical bug was fixed to provide the necessary state diffs for the Base U16a Sepolia upgrade ([#1204], [#1207]). Additionally, upgrade templates were updated to reflect the new U16a and OPCM v410 addresses ([#1203]).

### Protocol & Tooling Enhancements
Improvements were made to core protocol components and the developer environment.
- **AnchorStateRegistry:** Support for normalized hashes was added to AnchorStateRegistry V410, ensuring consistent behavior for the speedrun template ([#1209]).
- **Developer Experience:** The `mise` tool was improved by integrating `fzf` to resolve a dependency issue ([#1199]) and by updating its activation instructions for clarity ([#1211]).
- **Worldchain:** A bug affecting Worldchain's nonce update and hash was fixed ([#1210]), and a new template for key handback was introduced ([#1205], [#1208]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of several important issues related to network readiness and tooling, while new discussions point toward future architectural standards.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Network Readiness:** Key milestones were met with the closure of issues for Eris-0 load testing ([#16756]) and partner support criteria evaluation ([#16765]). Preparations for Fusaka activation were also completed for `proxyd` ([#467]).
    - **Tooling & Refactoring:** The `op-acceptor` tool was improved with better configuration logging and parallelism ([#461], [#462]). A CLI wrapper for the Forge binary was completed ([#17214]), and redundant address structs were consolidated into a single source of truth ([#14977]).
    - **Analysis & Specifications:** A threat modeling analysis for the DA Footprint Limit was completed ([#336]), and an issue regarding the dispute game creator pattern was closed as a duplicate ([#17436]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Network Upgrade Conventions:** A significant new discussion began in issue [#781] to establish a formal convention for network upgrade transactions that deploy new contracts. The conversation includes a detailed analysis of address collision resistance, comparing `CREATE` and `CREATE2` to ensure safe and predictable deployments.
    - **Persistent Flakiness:** The `TestPreNoInbox` test in `op-acceptance-tests` continues to be flaky ([#17298]), with a recent fix attempt proving insufficient. This remains an ongoing CI stability concern.
    - **Ongoing Investigations:** Active discussions continue around preparing `op-node` for Fusaka ([#17493]) and investigating a Geth crash related to RLP receipt decoding during op-mainnet sync ([#679]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The week's activity demonstrated strong, focused collaboration on the U16a upgrade, requiring tight coordination to prepare a diverse set of chains across the Superchain ecosystem. The resolution of the Forge Deployer wrapper issue ([#17214]) through a pull request in the main `optimism` repository highlights effective cross-repository work. Furthermore, the deep technical dive in issue [#781] on network upgrade transaction conventions, featuring a detailed analysis from @protolambda, showcases the community's commitment to robust architectural design and forward-looking standards.
