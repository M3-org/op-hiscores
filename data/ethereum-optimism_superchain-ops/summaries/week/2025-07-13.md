# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were heavily focused on enhancing governance procedures and testing infrastructure. Significant progress was made in integrating Security Council Rehearsals into the new `superchain-ops` system, complete with new templates for signer removal and nested upgrades. The team also streamlined CI configurations and resolved several long-standing issues related to sequencer stability and recovery. While key infrastructure decisions were made regarding builder deployments, active discussions continue on improving test environments to better mirror production topology and on resolving a persistent issue with invalid interop transactions in the txpool.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving governance operations, validation, and system performance.

-   **Security Council Rehearsal Integration:** A major effort was made to integrate Security Council Rehearsals into the `superchain-ops` improvements system. This included adding initial rehearsal scripts and documentation ([#1121](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1121)), and later enhancing the process with new templates for GnosisSafe signer removal and nested upgrades ([#1128](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1128), [#1132](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1132)).

-   **CI and Configuration Streamlining:** To support the new rehearsal system, old CI configurations were removed in favor of a unified `just simulate-all-templates` job, simplifying the CI pipeline ([#1130](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1130)).

-   **Multisig and Validation Improvements:** The `MultisigTask` contract was refactored for better code organization and readability ([#1090](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1090), [#1129](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1129)). Several validation files were updated to correct addresses and nonces ([#865](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/865)), add missing `approvedHashes` for DPM/DGM operations ([#1135](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1135)), and update READMEs for the U16 upgrade ([#1134](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1134)).

-   **Performance Enhancements:** A minor performance improvement was merged for state diff decoding by optimizing `AccountAccessParser.sol` to avoid redundant function calls ([#1138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1138)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of numerous legacy issues, particularly around sequencer stability, while new discussions focused on infrastructure migration and test environment parity.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Sequencer Stability:** A significant cleanup occurred with the closure of several long-standing issues related to sequencer recovery from window expiration ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/11228]), halting on temporary errors ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/12240]), and node startup failures ([#15411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15411)).
    -   **Testing:** Issues for porting `TestChainFork` ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/413)) and a general interop acceptance test ([#298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/298)) were closed. An issue for failing acceptance tests after an `op-geth` bump was also resolved by temporarily skipping the problematic tests ([#16731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16731)).
    -   **Infrastructure & Code:** Decisions were finalized to skip NVMe node deployment for `op-rbuilders` for now ([#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16689)). An issue regarding code duplication in `op-batcher` was also swiftly identified and closed ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16677)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Block Explorer Migration:** A new initiative was created to migrate from Etherscan to Blockscout for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia L2 explorers ([#1131](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1131)).
    -   **Test Topology Alignment:** An important discussion is underway to align the Kurtosis interop devnet with the production topology by adding `proxyd` and verifier nodes, aiming to increase test reliability ([#16746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16746)).
    -   **Ongoing Investigations:** Discussions continue on the design of the `op-sync-tester` ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16452)) and the challenging task of identifying why invalid interop transactions are sometimes included in the txpool ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/635)). Enabling flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers remains blocked pending stabilization on other infrastructure ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16688)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted healthy collaboration within the contributor community. The `op-batcher` code duplication issue ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16677)) was a great example of community-driven improvement, with @chuwt identifying the problem and offering to submit a fix, which was encouraged by maintainer @geoknee.

Furthermore, active technical discussions on issues like the `op-sync-tester` design ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16452)) and interop stress testing ([#15285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15285)) involved multiple contributors, including @protolambda, @pcw109550, @pauldowman, and @mds1, demonstrating a collaborative approach to solving complex engineering challenges.
