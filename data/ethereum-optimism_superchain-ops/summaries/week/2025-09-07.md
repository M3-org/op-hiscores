# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by the successful completion of the flashblocks rollout and a significant strategic shift in development focus. The team enabled flashblocks across remaining mainnet sequencers, established the necessary monitoring and alerting, and adjusted the sequencer set for Raft consensus. Concurrently, a large number of issues related to the Kurtosis devnet environment were closed, signaling a de-prioritization of that tool in favor of other priorities. Work also progressed on testing infrastructure and preparations for the upcoming U16a Freya devnet upgrade, rounding out a week of both completing major initiatives and refining the project's roadmap.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This week's development focused on Superchain configuration upgrades, critical tooling fixes, and preparations for future network upgrades.

-   **Superchain Configuration & Upgrades:**
    -   The OPCM templates were updated for OP-Contracts v4.1.0, which included a U16A OPCM upgrade and enhancements to SuperchainConfig templates ([#1185](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1185)).
    -   In preparation for a devnet upgrade, tasks were added to upgrade four Freya devnet chains to U16a, starting with an update to SuperchainConfig v3.2.0 ([#1193](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1193)).

-   **Tooling Bug Fixes & Refinements:**
    -   A key bug was fixed in Tenderly link generation, which now correctly supports doubly nested safes for more complex multisig tasks, ensuring accurate simulation links ([#1197](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1197)).
    -   A minor code refactoring was performed to clean up an example task for superchain configuration upgrades, improving code hygiene ([#1195](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1195)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was characterized by a major backlog grooming effort, the resolution of several long-standing infrastructure tasks, and the proposal of a new performance enhancement.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Flashblocks Rollout Completed:** A significant cluster of issues related to flashblocks was closed, marking the completion of this initiative. This included enabling flashblocks on all remaining sequencers ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16759), [#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16760), [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17317)), managing the sequencer set for Raft consensus ([#17318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17318), [#17319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17319)), and implementing associated alerting ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16868)).
    -   **De-prioritization of Kurtosis:** A large number of issues related to Kurtosis devnet features and improvements were closed, with the rationale that it is no longer a primary focus ([#15753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15753), [#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/14390), [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17194)).
    -   **Testing & Infrastructure Cleanup:** Several legacy testing issues were closed, including the first milestone for sync acceptance tests ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16703)), enabling the sync-tester to use real chain data ([#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/454)), and removing obsolete proof system smoke tests ([#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/140)-[#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/143)).
    -   **`op-geth` & Node Stability:** Long-standing issues were resolved, including a panic on initialization with large genesis files ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/668)) and older reports of abnormal CPU usage ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/613)) and receipt decoding failures ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/679)) that were fixed in subsequent patches.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **`op-program` Enhancement:** A new issue proposes adding a hint for fast block header oracle lookups within `op-program` specifications, aiming to improve performance ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17416)). A draft PR is already under discussion.
    -   **Potential Blocker:** The nightly CI job for syncing with the latest `op-node` remains blocked by an infrastructure issue, delaying full implementation of mainnet sync testing ([#17253](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17253)).
    -   **Ongoing Work:** Progress continues on adding `soneium` to the contract upgrade tests, with an open PR to address the issue ([#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17332)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's activity reflects a period of focused execution and strategic realignment by the core team. The coordinated closure of numerous issues related to flashblocks and Kurtosis demonstrates strong internal alignment on completing major initiatives and making decisive roadmap adjustments. While there was limited public discussion on new PRs, the ongoing work on active issues like the `op-program` enhancement ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17416)) and local `op-geth` builds in Kurtosis ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16975)) shows continued collaboration on future improvements. The overall pattern suggests a "heads-down" week of shipping completed work and grooming the backlog for the next development cycle.
