# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the operational stability and usability of the Superchain. A critical `op-node` synchronization failure affecting multiple chains was resolved through an `op-geth` upgrade, demonstrating effective community-led troubleshooting. Significant documentation improvements were made for node operators, clarifying JSON-RPC APIs and environment variable configurations. While progress was made, a new node synchronization issue emerged towards the end of the week, highlighting the ongoing focus required to maintain network health. Concurrently, development continued with enhancements to the Soneium Minato Testnet and the introduction of new production and betanet configurations.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on expanding testnet capabilities in preparation for future upgrades.

- **Soneium Minato Testnet Enhancements:** The testnet was updated to support permissionless fault proofs. This involved adding a permissionless game type (0) and setting it as the respected game type for the network. The `addGameType` task was successfully executed, marking a step forward in testing and validating the fault proof system ([#1317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1317), [#1320](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1320)).

Additionally, new pull requests were opened to prepare for future deployments, including adding betanet tasks for U18 ([#1319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1319)) and introducing new production configurations ([#1318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1318)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was dominated by node synchronization challenges, with one major issue resolved and a new one under active investigation.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Node Synchronization Resolution:** A critical issue where `op-node` v1.16.3 failed to sync for Optimism, Base, and Worldchain was resolved. The solution, confirmed by the reporter, was to upgrade and resync `op-geth`, restoring normal operations ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18510)).
    - **Documentation for Node Operators:** Key documentation gaps were addressed. The JSON-RPC API documentation was restructured into separate, clearer pages for `op-node` and `op-geth` ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1773)). Missing environment variables corresponding to flags were also added, simplifying configuration for operators ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1874)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **New Node Synchronization Failures:** A new high-priority issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18581)) emerged, with users on Optimism, Base, and Unichain reporting nodes failing to sync with "missing trie node" errors. The problem appears linked to `op-geth` instances using snapshots, potentially where the L1 Execution Client fails to provide necessary state data. Full logs and configurations have been requested to diagnose this potential blocker.
    - **Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug:** An investigation continues into a possible bug where the `op-node` sequencer incorrectly enters recovery mode during normal operation ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18350)). Discussion this week pointed to a related pull request in the `optimism` repository that might address the root cause, and a code snippet was proposed to prevent temporary errors during recovery.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong collaboration between maintainers and the community in diagnosing and resolving critical operational issues. In the resolution of the `op-node` sync failure ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18510)), community member `J1a-wei` provided the initial report and confirmation of the fix, while maintainer `geoknee` guided the debugging process. A similar dynamic is unfolding in the new sync issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18581)), where multiple users are providing data to help pinpoint the cause. Internally, discussion on the sequencer bug ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18350)) shows active collaboration between `geoknee` and `sebastianst` to identify a solution.
