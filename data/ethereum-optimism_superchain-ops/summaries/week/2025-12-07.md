# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the stability and usability of the Superchain. A critical `op-node` synchronization failure affecting multiple chains was resolved by upgrading `op-geth`, restoring operational continuity. Significant documentation improvements were made for node operators, clarifying JSON-RPC APIs and environment variable configurations. While these key issues were closed, new reports of node synchronization problems emerged, alongside ongoing investigation into a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recover mode, indicating a continued focus on network health and reliability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on testnet enhancements and preparing new configurations.

- **Soneium Minato Testnet Enhancements:** The testnet's capabilities were expanded by introducing a permissionless game type (0) and setting it as the respected game type. The task to add the game type was successfully executed, advancing the testnet's functionality ([#1317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1317), [#1320](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1320)).
- **New Configurations in Progress:** New pull requests were opened to introduce production configurations ([#1318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1318)) and add betanet tasks for U18 ([#1319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1319)), signaling preparation for future upgrades and deployments.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
Key operational and documentation gaps were addressed this week, improving stability and operator experience.

- **Node Synchronization Resolution:** A critical issue where `op-node` v1.16.3 failed to synchronize for Optimism, Base, and Worldchain was resolved. The solution involved upgrading and resyncing `op-geth`, confirming a dependency between the components ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18510)).
- **Documentation for Node Operators:** The JSON-RPC API documentation was restructured with separate pages for `op-node` and `op-geth` for better clarity ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1773)). Additionally, missing documentation for environment variables corresponding to node flags was restored ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1874)).

### New & Active Issues
While past issues were resolved, new and complex node-related problems are under active investigation.

- **New Synchronization Problems:** A significant active issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18581)) details nodes on Optimism, Base, and Unichain failing to sync with "missing trie node" errors. The problem appears linked to using `op-geth` with snapshots, and maintainers are gathering detailed logs and configurations to diagnose the root cause.
- **Sequencer Recover Mode Bug:** Investigation continues into a possible bug where the `op-node` sequencer incorrectly enters recover mode during normal operation ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18350)). Community discussion has linked a potential related PR and proposed a code snippet to prevent temporary errors, indicating active collaborative debugging.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was prominent this week, particularly in reporting and troubleshooting node-level issues. Operators from various chains, including Optimism, Base, Worldchain, and Unichain, provided valuable feedback and logs for synchronization problems ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18510), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18581)). There is also evidence of collaborative debugging in active issues, with community members like geoknee and sebastianst contributing insights and potential fixes for the sequencer recover mode investigation ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18350)).
