# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant codebase modernization and strategic planning for future protocol enhancements. A major milestone was the removal of the legacy `superchain-ops` system, streamlining the repository for future development. Concurrently, work began on preparing for future network upgrades with a new U13-to-U16 template, and active discussions took place around migrating the OP Deployer to use Forge. The team also focused on improving protocol reliability, with discussions on a new `op-node` sync mechanism and the finalization of the `min-base-fee` specification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on refactoring, preparing for future upgrades, and improving CI reliability.

*   **Codebase Modernization & Refactoring**
    *   The legacy `superchain-ops` system was completely removed from the `main` branch, marking a significant cleanup of the repository. A tag was created to preserve historical access ([#1163](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1163)).

*   **Upgrade & Action Templating**
    *   To streamline future network upgrades, a template and example task were introduced to allow chains to upgrade directly from U13 to U16 ([#1144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1144)).
    *   A new template was added to facilitate L2 actions initiated from L1 through the OptimismPortal ([#1173](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1173)).
    *   A draft pull request was opened to introduce liveness templates, aiming to improve operational documentation ([#1175](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1175)).

*   **CI & Testing Reliability**
    *   To combat CI flakiness, fork retries were added to simulation scripts, improving the reliability of the test suite ([#1172](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1172)).

*   **Dependency Management**
    *   A routine bump of the monorepo commit was performed to keep dependencies up to date ([#1174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1174)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Discussions this week centered on major upcoming architectural changes, protocol specifications, and improving cross-repository testing.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Protocol Specification:** The issue to write the specification for `min-base-fee` was closed, indicating the formal documentation is now complete and ratified ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/742)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Forge Deployer Migration:** A significant new effort is being planned to migrate the OP Deployer to use Forge. A series of tracking issues ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17213) - [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17218)) were opened to outline the required work, attracting immediate community interest.
    *   **`op-node` Sync Mechanism:** A critical discussion is underway to deprecate the `req-resp` p2p sync protocol in `op-node` ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/14108)). A detailed alternative was proposed, suggesting a simpler and faster mechanism using Redis for block gossiping and an `admin` API for injection, which could improve node recovery and scale-out.
    *   **CI/CD Enhancements:** A new issue proposes running the monorepo CI suite on `op-geth` pull requests to catch regressions before they are merged, highlighting a focus on tighter cross-repository integration ([#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/665)).
    *   **Documentation & User Experience:** An ongoing discussion highlighted confusion among external chain operators regarding the `op-deployer` documentation. A community-submitted PR aims to overhaul the docs to provide clearer instructions ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1530)).
    *   **Flashblocks:** While support for flashblocks in Kurtosis was officially deprioritized ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16514)), discussions continued around creating new sequencer alerts ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16867), [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16868)) and documenting load test results ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16756)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week saw strong community engagement, particularly around future development efforts.

*   Contributor `tooshiNoko` showed significant initiative by expressing interest in taking ownership of the entire "Forge Deployer" migration effort across a half-dozen related issues ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17213) - [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17218)).
*   The discussion around deprecating the `req-resp` sync protocol ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/14108)) was enriched by a detailed proposal from `emilianobonassi`, who had prototyped an alternative solution, demonstrating deep community involvement in core protocol design.
*   Feedback from external chain operators in the `op-deployer` documentation issue ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1530)) underscores the project's growing user base and the importance of clear, actionable documentation.
