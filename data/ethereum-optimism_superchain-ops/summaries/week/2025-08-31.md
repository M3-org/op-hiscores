# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing developer experience and addressing critical bugs. Significant performance gains were achieved in the CI pipeline, with regression tests now running 40% faster. Key fixes were deployed for a Worldchain nonce issue and a Go version incompatibility affecting developer tooling. Meanwhile, active discussions progressed on the integration of Kona + Cannon fault proofs, signaling a major focus on future protocol upgrades. Preparations for network upgrades also began, with new pull requests opened to bring several Sepolia testnets to the U16 release.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving system stability, performance, and developer workflow.

**CI & Developer Experience Improvements**
- **CI Performance:** A series of optimizations were merged to improve CI stability and speed. By reducing concurrent processes to mitigate 502 errors and skipping unnecessary account decoding in tests, a 40% performance improvement was realized in regression tests ([#1177](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1177), [#1178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1178)).
- **Go Version Compatibility:** A bug was fixed by updating the Go version used by `mise` to `1.24.6`. This resolves a compatibility issue with `eip712sign` and ensures local development environments function correctly ([#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1183)).

**Critical Bug Fixes**
- **Worldchain Nonce Correction:** A critical bug affecting L1 ownership transfers for Worldchain was resolved. The fix ensures the correct nonce number is used, restoring proper functionality ([#1176](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1176)).

**Upcoming Network Upgrades**
- Pull requests were opened to upgrade Zora Sepolia ([#1180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1180)), Metal Sepolia ([#1181](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1181)), and Mode Sepolia ([#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1182)) from release U13 to U16.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed this week, but significant progress was made in discussions on active issues, clarifying the path forward for key initiatives.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Kona + Cannon Integration:** This was a major topic of discussion. Planning is underway to support the new fault proof system across the stack. This includes updating OPCM to deploy the new game type ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17285)), ensuring `op-dispute-mon` can monitor Kona games ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17286)), and adapting tooling to manage `cannon-kona` prestates ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17283)).
    - **CI/CD and Testing:** Discussions in [#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17184) highlighted challenges with the current CircleCI configuration, particularly the difficulty of running tests locally. In parallel, issue [#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16703) was reopened to expand sync test coverage for all hardfork transitions.
    - **Configuration Bugs:** A bug in P2P gossip configuration where default values were being improperly overwritten was identified in [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17308), with a fix proposed to prevent panics in tests.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed planning for the upcoming Kona + Cannon integration. Discussions in issues [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17285) and [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17286) show active coordination between core contributors to define the required changes across different parts of the system. The parallel submission of multiple network upgrade PRs ([#1180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1180), [#1181](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1181), [#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1182)) also suggests a coordinated effort to align Superchain networks on the next release.
