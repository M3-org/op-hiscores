# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Jun 1 - 7, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on enhancing the security and reliability of the Superchain. Significant progress was made in preparing the Mode and Metal Mainnets for permissioned fault proofs, a key step towards greater decentralization. Concurrently, the team addressed critical operational issues, including bug fixes for nonce management on Base Sepolia and improvements to simulation scripts. Important architectural discussions are ongoing, particularly concerning the `op-supervisor`'s role in providing data for fault proofs, which is considered a blocker for future devnet migrations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development efforts focused on both proactive upgrades and immediate bug fixes to maintain chain stability.

- **Fault Proof System Preparations**
  Work began on transitioning Mode and Metal Mainnet to a permissioned fault proof system. This foundational effort involved adding the initial files and tasks required for the upgrade, paving the way for enhanced security guarantees across these chains ([#955](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/955), [#956](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/956)).

- **Nonce Management and Simulation Fixes**
  Several bug fixes were implemented to improve system reliability. A specific fix was deployed to correct nonce handling on Base Sepolia following a recent transaction ([#1061](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1061)). General updates to Sepolia nonce management were also made ([#1048](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1048)). Additionally, a bug in the `sim-sequence` script was resolved by introducing an environment flag to control override checks, making simulation processes more robust ([#1051](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1051)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving test suite dependencies, identifying new potential risks, and advancing discussions on critical active problems.

- **Closed Issues:**
  An issue related to `op-acceptance-tests` was closed, removing a dependency on the deprecated supervisor multinode support ([#16187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16187)). This refines the test suite and aligns it with the current architecture.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - A new issue was opened regarding the `op-supervisor`'s reset logic, which currently lacks a check for the canonical nature of the L1 origin ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16315)). This highlights a potential risk if the L1 chain changes during a reset.
  - A critical discussion is ongoing for issue [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16166), which concerns the `op-supervisor`'s inability to provide data for fault proofs with non-genesis interop upgrades. There is a consensus that this must be fixed before devnet migrations can proceed, with a preference for a solution within the `op-supervisor` itself.
  - The user-facing issue of `eth_getTransactionCount` returning an incorrect nonce on the Base node ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/623)) remains active, with users reporting stuck transactions and requesting updates.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the focused discussions around complex technical challenges. The active debate on issue [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16166) highlights a collaborative effort to determine the best architectural path forward for fault proofs, weighing different implementation strategies to resolve a significant blocker. Furthermore, the continued attention on user-reported problems, such as the Base node nonce issue ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/623)), demonstrates the team's engagement with the broader ecosystem and its commitment to addressing operational pain points.
