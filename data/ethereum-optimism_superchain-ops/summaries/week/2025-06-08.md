# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Jun 8 - 14, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on improving system reliability and addressing foundational technical debt. Significant discussions took place around diagnosing and mitigating CI flakiness, with a focus on infrastructure improvements and better reporting for acceptance tests. A dependency issue was resolved, and a new issue was opened to enhance the `AccountAccessParser` by removing hardcoded values. Additionally, a long-standing feature request for state dumping saw renewed interest from the community.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no major features were merged, progress was made on code maintenance and refinement.

A new pull request ([#1080](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1080)) was opened to refactor the name of a parent multisig to "root safe," improving clarity within the codebase.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on dependency fixes, planning for future enhancements, and tackling persistent CI instability.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Dependency Management:** Issue [#1146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1146) was closed, resolving a build problem caused by the absence of a `dist` directory in recent versions of the `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` package.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **CI & Test Reliability:** Discussions were active across two key issues. In [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16271), investigation continued into CI flakiness, with updates suggesting infrastructure is the primary cause. In a related effort on [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16378), a new "Flakiness Report" was shared to better identify problematic tests, and a discussion emerged about measuring flakiness by package rather than individual tests for more accurate analysis.
    - **Future Enhancements:** A new issue, [#1064](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1064), was opened to improve `AccountAccessParser`. The goal is to dynamically find slots for normalized hashing, replacing the current hardcoded approach for a more robust long-term solution.
    - **State Dumping:** A long-standing issue, [#390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/390), received a new comment inquiring about progress on a feature to dump the full state of addresses, signaling continued community interest.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the concerted effort to address CI and testing reliability. Contributors `scharissis`, `nonsense`, `pcw109550`, and `teddyknox` were actively involved in the discussion around issue [#16378], sharing reports and debating the best approach to measure test flakiness. Additionally, community member `@0xWilliamWang` revived discussion on an older issue ([#390]), demonstrating ongoing user engagement with the project's backlog.
