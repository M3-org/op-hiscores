# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the Superchain's economic and operational frameworks. A significant advancement was the introduction of new templates to streamline vault upgrades and revenue sharing, simplifying the process for chains to integrate with the ecosystem's financial mechanisms. Alongside this new feature development, there was a substantial focus on improving project stability and maintainability. This involved resolving numerous flaky tests, closing a large backlog of outdated issues, and refining internal processes by formalizing work previously tracked only in code comments into proper GitHub issues.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week balanced new feature implementation with crucial improvements to testing, tooling, and registry maintenance.

- **Revenue Sharing and Vault Upgrade Framework:** New templates were introduced to provide chains with a clear and flexible path for upgrading their vaults and opting into revenue sharing ([#1257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1257)). This foundational work supports the economic sustainability of the Superchain ecosystem. A work-in-progress effort to create even safer templates was also initiated ([#1298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1298)).

- **Testing and Integration Improvements:** To support the new revenue sharing capabilities, integration tests for the `RevShareContractsUpgraderIntegration.t.sol` contract were enhanced ([#1302](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1302), [#1301](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1301)). These improvements ensure the reliability of the new financial components.

- **Tooling and Registry Maintenance:** The developer environment was updated by aligning the `jq` version to match the monorepo, ensuring script compatibility ([#1300](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1300)). The superchain registry was also updated to resolve a test failure by removing a defunct chain ID, maintaining data integrity ([#1299](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1299)).

- **Ecosystem Onboarding:** A new pull request was opened for the "Worldchain key handover" ([#1304](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1304)), indicating ongoing work to integrate new partners into the Superchain.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
This week saw a major push to clean up the issue backlog and refine project management practices. While no new issues were opened, significant activity occurred around existing ones.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Test Suite Stability:** A number of flaky tests were resolved, improving the reliability of the CI pipeline. This included issues related to L2 network divergence, channel manager memory, and timestamp invariants ([#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15782), [#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17966), [#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18138)).
    - **Backlog Cleanup:** Many older issues were closed, having become obsolete or been resolved by subsequent refactors like SCR 2.0. These addressed outdated concerns in `op-node` performance, hardfork opt-in processes, and CI job clarity ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16332), [#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/610), [#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/644)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Process Improvement:** A notable trend was the reopening of several issues related to `op-node` sync mechanisms, the event system, and the `op-supervisor` ([#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16141), [#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16917), [#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15817)). This was done to formally track outstanding `TODO` items from the codebase, representing a move towards more rigorous issue management.
    - **Strategic Decisions:** Discussion on the `min-base-fee` feature concluded that further simulations are not planned; instead, the feature's effectiveness will be observed in a production environment ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16958)).
    - **Future Work:** Issues concerning EL Sync behavior ([#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17631), [#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18124)) are being deferred until the full deprecation of Request/Response Sync.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was characterized by a strong internal focus on improving project health and clarifying future work. The active triage of the issue backlog, with team members questioning the relevance of old issues and providing context, demonstrates a commitment to maintaining a clean and actionable work queue. The decision to reopen issues to track `TODOs` found in the code highlights a collaborative effort to enhance transparency and process. Furthermore, communication between the engineering and documentation teams is evident in the effort to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for future upgrades ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18095)).
