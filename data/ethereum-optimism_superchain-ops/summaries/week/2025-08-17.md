# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant progress in modernizing the project's operational tooling and bolstering its testing infrastructure. Development focused on migrating tasks to a new templating framework, which included adding several new contract templates. Concurrently, the team made substantial strides in improving code robustness by increasing test coverage, refining the CI/CD pipeline, and closing out a major umbrella issue for proofs interop acceptance testing. This concerted effort reflects a strong push towards stabilization, maintainability, and preparing the superchain-ops system for future upgrades.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on refactoring core operational components and enhancing test frameworks.

- **Expansion of the New Templating Framework:** A key focus was the continued migration to the new superchain-ops templating system. The blacklist game task was successfully migrated ([#1168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1168)), and new templates were introduced to support `op-contracts/v4.0.0`, including `BlacklistGamesV400` ([#1170](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1170)) and `UpdateRetirementTimestampV400` ([#1171](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1171)). This effort standardizes how operational tasks are defined and executed.

- **CI/CD and Test Coverage Enhancements:** The project's reliability was improved through significant testing and CI work. The CI configuration was streamlined by removing obsolete jobs in preparation for a new system ([#1164](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1164)). A major effort was completed to increase test coverage across key contracts like `SimpleAddressRegistry.sol`, `StackedSimulator.sol`, and `TaskManager.sol`, enhancing the overall robustness of the codebase ([#1166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1166)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of several important issues, with active discussions pointing toward future technical improvements.

- **Closed Issues:** A significant amount of work was finalized, resolving issues across testing, network configuration, and protocol refinement.
    - **Testing & Validation:** The umbrella issue for proofs interop acceptance testing ([#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15946)) was closed, marking the completion of all sub-tasks, including `op-challenger` acceptance tests ([#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15948)). An issue regarding missing test logs was resolved ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17151)), and a decision was made to deprecate Kurtosis in favor of Sysgo for network testing ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/375)).
    - **Network & Protocol:** Flashblocks were confirmed to be enabled on all Sunnyside sequencers ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16688)), and two events were removed from the event system ([#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17001)).
    - **Template Migration:** The issue tracking the migration of the blacklist games task to the new template framework was closed, confirming the work's completion ([#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1162)).

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened this week. However, important discussions on future work continued:
    - **Contract Verification:** Active discussion on [#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/14813) centers on improving contract verification by leveraging `forge verify-contract` once Forge binary support is available, aiming to reduce custom code.
    - **Validation Testing:** A conversation on [#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/686) is exploring how to enhance validation testing to prevent future bugs, with plans to review previously unplanned tests for potential implementation.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the coordinated effort to close out major testing initiatives and advance the new templating framework. The resolution of the proofs acceptance testing umbrella issue ([#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15946)) and the related event system refinement ([#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17001)), which involved multiple PRs across different repositories, highlights effective cross-project coordination. Furthermore, discussions on active issues like [#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/686) show team members proactively planning future improvements to testing strategy. The overall activity suggests a strong internal focus on reducing technical debt and building a more robust foundation.
