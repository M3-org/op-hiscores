# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on the successful deployment of the U17 Jovian Upgrade to OP betanets and sepolia-dev-0. The deployment was supported by a critical bug fix addressing a gas limit issue that arose during the upgrade transaction. In parallel, infrastructure was hardened by updating the OPCMv500 template for more dynamic address handling and switching the Sepolia RPC to a more reliable public node. Significant architectural discussions also took place around resolving a "backwards time travel" issue in Proxyd and defining strategies for future blob priority fee tracking.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on executing the U17 upgrade and improving the reliability of operational tooling.

**U17 Jovian Upgrade Deployment & Fixes**
*   The U17 Jovian Upgrade was successfully deployed to OP betanets and sepolia-dev-0, with the necessary tasks added to the repository ([#1273]).
*   A related pull request for "U17 Ink Sepolia" was also opened ([#1279]).
*   A bug was fixed where the U17 upgrade transaction failed on betanets due to a gas limit miscalculation by `forge`. The fix ensures the transaction can execute successfully within the Osaka gas limit ([#1280]).

**Infrastructure and Tooling Enhancements**
*   The OPCMv500 Upgrade template was improved to fetch addresses dynamically instead of using hardcoded values, and now utilizes `validateWithOverrides` for more robust validation ([#1282]).
*   To improve reliability, the Sepolia RPC endpoint was switched from Tenderly to a public node ([#1281]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened this week, but significant progress was made in discussions on key active issues, and one issue was closed.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   An issue regarding the reporting of unused acceptance tests ([#16273]) was closed, as the team's shift to "gateless mode" has made the original requirement obsolete.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Proxyd "Backwards Time Travel" ([#501]):** A detailed discussion took place to address an issue where Proxyd can return a previous block as `unsafe` when backends are out of sync. Four potential solutions were brainstormed, ranging from a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` to IP-based or signature-based sticky sessions, each with distinct trade-offs in performance and implementation complexity.
    *   **Blob Priority Fee Tracking ([#18102]):** A conversation continued on the best approach for `op-batcher` to track blob priority fees. The discussion weighed the pros and cons of a simple decaying fee from the previous transaction versus building a more robust, dedicated tracker that would persist across restarts.
    *   **`sysgo` Flashblock Support ([#16450]):** A contributor expressed interest in implementing support for flashblocks/rbuilders in `sysgo` to enable validation of related changes in `kona-node` and `rollup-boost`.
    *   **DA Footprint Limit Documentation ([#1742]):** Discussion continued on the need to document the risks associated with configuring the DA Footprint Limit scalar and its interaction with gas limit changes.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week saw strong collaboration on complex technical challenges. The in-depth discussion on the Proxyd "time travel" issue ([#501]) between Yashvardhan-kukreja and Joshklop highlighted a proactive approach to solving difficult architectural problems. Similarly, the strategic conversation between Sebastianst and ajsutton on blob priority fee tracking ([#18102]) demonstrates collaborative planning for future features. Teddyknox's initiative in expressing interest to tackle the `sysgo` flashblock issue ([#16450]) is a positive sign of community engagement and ownership.
