# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts were heavily focused on preparing for the upcoming Upgrade 18. Development centered on integrating new templates, regression tests, and specific tasks for the betanet deployment of U18. Alongside this preparatory work, the team enhanced the reliability of multisig operations by introducing a crucial gas limit check to prevent transaction failures. A key issue regarding the op-node's light client was also resolved, marking a step forward in protocol robustness.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on preparing for a major upgrade, improving system safety, and refining developer documentation.

- **Upgrade 18 Preparations:**
  Significant progress was made to ready the Superchain for Upgrade 18. Foundational work included integrating new templates, example tasks, and regression tests, which introduced new Solidity files for the upgrade configuration ([#1313](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1313)). Specific tasks for the OP betanet upgrade were also added, such as setting the respected game type and upgrading the `superchainConfig`, laying the groundwork for the deployment ([#1319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1319)). Further updates to these tasks are in progress ([#1326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1326)).

- **Multisig Reliability Enhancement:**
  To improve the safety of multisig operations, a new feature was merged that reverts tasks if their required gas limit is too close to the Fusaka transaction gas cap. This preventative measure helps avoid out-of-gas errors and increases the reliability of critical operations ([#1277](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1277)).

- **Documentation Fix:**
  An important correction was made to the `simulate-l2-ownership-transfer.md` guide. The documentation was updated to clarify that the "From" address in L2 simulations should be the aliased caller from L1, not the L2 transaction parameter, improving accuracy for developers ([#1291](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1291)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  A notable issue concerning the `op-node` light client's behavior of following external sources was closed, as the implementation for this feature is now complete ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18317)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  No new issues were opened this week. However, discussion continues on an active issue regarding `op-challenger`'s trace output when a super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18643)). The conversation confirmed that the super node trace provider is working correctly, but the issue remains open pending an integration test to verify alignment between `op-challenger` and `op-program`. This highlights a known problem where `op-program` can transition to an invalid hash with insufficient data.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Based on the available reports, development appears focused and methodical. The ongoing discussion on issue [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18643) indicates active collaboration on complex technical challenges, with team members working to verify component interactions and ensure correct behavior in edge cases.
