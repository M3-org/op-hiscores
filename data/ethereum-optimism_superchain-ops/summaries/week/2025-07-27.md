# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on enhancing operational security and preparing for future upgrades. A major feature was introduced to support multi-level nested Gnosis Safe signing, significantly improving transaction workflow flexibility for op-stack chains. In preparation for the U16 upgrade, a new template was added to streamline the process of unpausing the SuperchainConfig. Additionally, the `MultisigTask` contract was a central point of activity, receiving both a critical bug fix and a simplification refactor, while Security Council procedures were strengthened with new and updated rehearsal playbooks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving multisig functionality, operational readiness, and governance procedures.

- **Multisig and Signing Enhancements**
  - A significant new feature enables multi-level nesting for Gnosis Safe signing ([#1150](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1150)), moving beyond the previous single-level limitation to support more complex and secure transaction workflows.
  - The `MultisigTask` contract was refactored to improve readability and reduce complexity by removing the `root address` state variable ([#1149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1149)).
  - A bug was fixed in `MultisigTask.sol` to ensure configuration overrides are applied earlier, allowing developers to reliably assert on them during template setup ([#1151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1151)).

- **Operational Readiness and Governance**
  - To prepare for future network changes, a new template was added to facilitate unpausing the SuperchainConfig after the U16 upgrade ([#1137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1137)).
  - Security Council documentation was updated, and a new playbook for the "Remove Signer" rehearsal was added to bolster operational security practices ([#1153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1153), [#1154](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1154)).

- **New Work in Progress**
  - A new pull request was opened to fix the `set respected game template` ([#1157](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1157)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened and no existing issues were closed this week. However, there was significant discussion on a key upcoming feature.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - The "Min Base Fee" feature saw continued progress across two key issues. In the implementation tracking issue ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16807)), a draft `reth` pull request was shared to gather early feedback.
  - In the related specification issue ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/742)), a request was made to compute and include an estimate for the state growth implied by the feature, highlighting a focus on understanding its full impact before finalization.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the active discussions surrounding the "Min Base Fee" specification and implementation. The sharing of a draft PR from the `reth` repository for early review on issue [#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16807) indicates healthy cross-repository coordination. Furthermore, feedback on the specification in issue [#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/742) demonstrates active review and a commitment to thorough planning. The concentrated work on the `MultisigTask` contract across multiple pull requests also suggests a focused effort by the core team on a critical piece of infrastructure.
