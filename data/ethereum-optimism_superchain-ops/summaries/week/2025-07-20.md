# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by significant progress in the U16 upgrade lifecycle, with several critical tasks moving from preparation to on-chain execution. Development efforts focused on ensuring the stability and correctness of the upgrade through documentation fixes, validation improvements, and crucial bug fixes for speedrun templates. Concurrently, the team advanced the integration of flashblocks by closing deployment issues and shifting focus to establishing robust monitoring and alerting. Preparations for the July 2025 Security Council rehearsals also moved forward with the creation of new playbook materials.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on executing the U16 upgrade, preparing for security operations, and fixing bugs related to upgrade testing infrastructure.

- **U16 Upgrade Execution and Validation:**
  - A series of pull requests tracked the progression of U16 tasks 016-021. The tasks were first marked as "READY TO SIGN" ([#1142]) and later updated to "EXECUTED" with their corresponding Etherscan transaction hashes, confirming their successful on-chain completion ([#1148]).
  - To support this, initial work focused on correcting documentation ([#1139]) and fixing the interpretation of `AnchorStateRegistry` storage in validation files ([#1141]). Validation instructions for several tasks were also improved ([#1143]).

- **Security Council Rehearsal Preparation:**
  - New materials were prepared for the July 2025 Security Council Cohort B rehearsals. This included playbooks, READMEs, and simulation assets for "Rehearsal 1 - Welcome," "rehearsal-2-remove-signer," and "rehearsal-3-nested-upgrade" ([#1140]).

- **Upgrade Tooling and Bug Fixes:**
  - A key bug fix enhanced the `OPCMTaskBase` to support multiple OPCM targets, a necessary change for enabling speedrun templates from U13 to U16 ([#1146]).
  - Another fix addressed creation collision errors in speedruns by enabling the use of historical prestates, preventing conflicts when testing multiple upgrades ([#1147]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of several infrastructure and operational issues, with active discussions now focused on monitoring and future configuration needs. No new issues were opened.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks Integration:** Significant progress was made with the closure of issues related to flashblocks RPC configuration ([#16544]), non-public deployment on op-sepolia ([#16496]), and the deployment of a flashblocks-websocket-proxy ([#16686]).
  - **Operational Readiness:** The fault proof "Runbook v3 final review" was completed and closed, with runbooks updated and versioned for clarity ([#16651]).
  - **Component Cleanup:** Two long-standing issues were resolved. An issue to improve the `op-supervisor` reset target functionality was closed due to recent refactoring ([#16314]), and another concerning a reusable logger utility was closed after concluding the current implementation is sufficient ([#15139]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks Monitoring:** With deployment tasks complete, focus has shifted to monitoring. A detailed discussion in issue [#16388] outlined requirements for alerts and metrics, including peer counts, pending transaction spikes, and performance SLAs for the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` and related components.
  - **Configuration & Tooling:** An issue regarding a configurable Data Availability (DA) type for the interop SuperSystem ([#15406]) was reopened after being closed by automation, noting it is a prerequisite for future cleanup but not a blocker for the current interop release.
  - **Development Blocker:** An effort to add a semgrep rule for function naming conventions ([#15115]) is currently blocked because GitHub Actions is disabled for the repository, preventing the assigned agent from proceeding.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's activity demonstrates a highly coordinated and task-focused effort. The clear progression of the U16 upgrade‚Äîfrom validation fixes ([#1141]) to marking tasks as ready ([#1142]) and finally executed ([#1148])‚Äîhighlights tight collaboration within the team. Similarly, the closure of multiple flashblocks deployment issues followed by an immediate, in-depth discussion on monitoring requirements ([#16388]) shows a seamless transition from implementation to operational stability. The resolution of older issues ([#16314], [#15139]) also suggests a collective effort to reduce technical debt and refine existing components.
