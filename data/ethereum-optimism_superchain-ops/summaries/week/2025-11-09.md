# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on preparing for the U17 (Jovian) upgrade, with extensive configuration and documentation updates for the Base Sepolia and Sepolia stacks. Alongside this major upgrade work, the team focused on bolstering system stability by re-introducing regression tests and adding a new rehearsal task to the CI/CD pipeline. Important discussions continued around optimizing `op-node` performance by reducing `FCU` calls and improving safeguards for system configuration updates, signaling a dual focus on both immediate upgrade needs and long-term protocol health.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on network upgrades, testing infrastructure, and documentation.

-   **U17 Sepolia Upgrade Preparations:** A significant effort was dedicated to preparing for the Jovian U17 upgrade. This involved extensive updates to configuration, README, and validation files for the Base Sepolia and Sepolia stacks ([#1267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1267), [#1286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1286)). The work ensures that tasks are properly structured, with no more than two chains per task.

-   **CI/CD and Testing Improvements:** The project's testing and continuous integration framework was strengthened. Regression tests were re-added to the CI configuration to prevent regressions ([#1288](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1288)), and a new rehearsal task was introduced for a governance upgrade ([#1289](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1289)).

-   **Devnet Configuration and Documentation:** A pull request was opened to upgrade the `superchainConfig` for the Soneium devnet ([#1287](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1287)). A minor but important fix was also made to correct file paths in the main `README.md` ([#1290](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1290)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened this week, but progress was made on closing existing ones and advancing discussions on key topics.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   A key testing issue was resolved, confirming that Jovian action tests have been successfully added to Kona's CI pipeline, ensuring proof validation for the upcoming upgrade ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17303)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **`op-node` Performance (`#15393`):** Discussion continued on optimizing `op-node`'s safe-head advancement to reduce the frequency of `FCU` (ForkchoiceUpdated) messages sent to the Execution Layer. The `kona-node` implementation, which sends only one concluding `FCU` per span batch, was highlighted as a potential solution to the "FCU spam" problem.
    -   **Upgrade Documentation (`#18095`):** The need to formally document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for standard chain upgrades was discussed. The devrel team has acknowledged its importance and plans to update the official documentation.
    -   **System Safeguards (`#18246`):** An issue to improve safeguards around batcher updates on the `SystemConfig` remains active, pointing to ongoing efforts to enhance the robustness of system configuration changes.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
While the reports do not name individual contributors, the nature of the work indicates strong internal collaboration. The extensive file changes across the U17 upgrade pull requests ([#1267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1267), [#1286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1286)) suggest a coordinated team effort. Furthermore, active issue discussions show deep technical engagement, particularly in [#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15393), which references work in the separate `optimism/optimism` repository, highlighting cross-project coordination. The discussion in [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18095) also demonstrates collaboration between the core development and devrel teams to improve documentation for chain operators.
