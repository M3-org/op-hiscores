# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Nov 23 - 29, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on operational maintenance and a critical bug investigation. A minor configuration update for RPC overrides was merged, alongside routine task status updates. The primary focus, however, was the ongoing discussion and analysis of a significant bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recovery mode, which could potentially stall L1 origin advancement and impact derivation.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
### RPC Configuration and Task Management
A maintenance update was merged to improve operational flexibility. This change introduced a new RPC override environment variable and updated the status of several U17 mainnet tasks to "executed" within the `src/script` directory ([#1307](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1307)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
### Closed Issues
Based on the available reports, no issues were closed this week.

### New & Active Issues
No new issues were opened. However, significant discussion continued around a critical active issue:
*   **`op-node` Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18350)):** Investigation is ongoing for a bug where a healthy sequencer in recovery mode stalls after requesting an L1 origin block that does not yet exist. This can lead to "not found" errors, violate the sequencer drift rule, and halt derivation if a bad batch is posted to L1. A potential code snippet to fix the issue by preventing temporary errors at the chain tip has been proposed, but further analysis is underway.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was focused on the investigation of the `op-node` sequencer bug ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18350)). The ongoing discussions and proposal of a potential fix highlight active engagement from the team in diagnosing and resolving this critical stability issue.
