# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Nov 30 - 6, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on expanding the Superchain ecosystem and solidifying the technical path for future capabilities. Significant progress was made in integrating new chains, with Base being added as an executed U17 and key handback tasks for Worldchain being implemented and marked as complete. A major milestone was achieved in clarifying the project's strategy for ZK games, resulting in the closure of numerous related issues and confirming that `op-challenger` will be the designated tool for this purpose. Concurrently, active discussions and bug reports highlighted potential blockers for node operators, particularly around `op-node` sync issues.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on integrating new chains, improving internal tooling, and preparing for upcoming upgrades.

- **Superchain Expansion & Integration:**
  - **Base:** The integration of Base as an executed U17 was completed, expanding the interoperability of the Superchain ([#1312](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1312)).
  - **Worldchain:** A new feature was added to handle the Worldchain Sepolia key handback task, which included new environment files, configurations, and a Solidity contract ([#1284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1284)). This was later marked as executed on Sepolia ([#1315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1315)).

- **Internal Process & Configuration:**
  - Test configurations were updated to include "soneium" across several integration and regression test files ([#1309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1309)).
  - Internal tooling saw improvements with updates to a safer safes template ([#1298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1298)) and a refinement of repository permissions by updating the `CODEOWNERS` file for the Sepolia task directory ([#1306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1306)).

- **Preparation for Future Upgrades:**
  - Two new pull requests were opened to prepare for future network upgrades: one to add an `AddGameType` task for the u18-alphanet ([#1314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1314)) and another introducing an "Upgrade 18 Template" ([#1313](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1313)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  A significant number of issues related to ZK proof generation and challenger functionality were closed, marking a clear decision point for the project.
  - **ZK Game & Challenger Strategy:** It was decided that the succinct proposer will generate ZK proofs, and `op-challenger` is now considered ready to support challenging ZK game types ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18319), [#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18321), [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18322)).
  - **Challenger Configuration:** A batch of issues concerning challenger test coverage, bond handling, and configuration was closed, as the existing `op-challenger` implementation already addresses these requirements ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18427), [#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18412), [#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18413), [#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18414), [#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18415)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  Several active issues are highlighting potential blockers and defining future work.
  - **Node Operation Blockers:** Two issues are impacting node operators. One describes `op-node` getting stuck in an initialization loop when syncing with an already-synced execution layer client, blocking a Base Mainnet node ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18468)). Another reports an "invalid block signature" error during testnet deployment, which has been confirmed by multiple users ([#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17448)).
  - **Future Work Scheduled:** Discussion on the `Proxyd` "time travel" bug ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/501)), where out-of-sync backends can serve incorrect block data, concluded with a contributor planning to address it in early January.
  - **Ongoing Discussions:** A discussion on porting the `SuperchainConfig` type ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/741)) has resulted in a new pull request to implement the change. Planning for acceptance tests for new EIPs on `fusaka-on-l2` is also underway ([#18221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18221)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the issue tracker this week. Users experiencing the same `op-node` bugs ([#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17448), [#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18468)) provided confirmations, helping to validate and prioritize the reports. Internal team coordination was also visible, with clear communication on scheduling future work for a complex `Proxyd` issue ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/501)). The resolution of numerous ZK-related issues suggests a focused, collaborative effort to define a clear technical path forward and reduce backlog.
