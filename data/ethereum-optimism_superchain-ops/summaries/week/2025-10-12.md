# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on enhancing the stability and functionality of the Superchain ecosystem. Significant progress was made in coordinating with external RPC providers to stabilize Flashblocks integration, resolving key connectivity issues. Development continued on dispute monitoring, with active discussions centered on improving how `op-dispute-mon` handles out-of-sync nodes to prevent false positives. Additionally, key operational tasks were completed, and tooling was improved with new validation instructions for `op-txverify`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on operational execution, tooling enhancements, and specification updates.

- **Operational Tasks Executed:** Two Ethereum tasks, `028-arena-z-main-u13-to-u16a` and `029-swell-main-u13-to-u16a`, were successfully marked as executed, signifying progress in network maintenance and upgrades ([#1250](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1250)).

- **Tooling and Specification Updates:**
    - To improve usability, new validation instructions were added for the `op-txverify` tool ([#1251](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1251)).
    - The Data Availability (DA) footprint block limit specification was updated to use the `blobBaseFee` header field, closing issue [#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/792) via the implementation in PR #800.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving Flashblocks integration problems and advancing discussions on dispute game mechanics.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Integration:** Two critical issues related to Flashblocks were resolved. One addressed the loss of flashblocks due to connectivity issues in the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17856)). The other marked the completion of coordination with most RPC providers for a new Flashblocks node ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17857)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened during this period.
    - **`op-dispute-mon` Sync Handling ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17814)):** A significant discussion is ongoing regarding how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes. The current proposal is to use `syncStatus` to verify if a node has processed the L1 block where a dispute game was created, and to ignore results from nodes that are too far behind to avoid incorrect disagreement detection.
    - **Dispute Game Implementation ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17257)):** This issue, related to using the v2 dispute game implementation in `OPCM.deploy`, was reopened. A remaining `TODO` in the code indicates that further work is required before the implementation is considered complete.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the successful coordination with external Flashblocks RPC providers, with Blockscout acknowledging the integration and planning to complete it soon. Internally, the active and detailed discussion on issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17814) highlights the team's collaborative approach to solving complex technical challenges related to the dispute resolution system.
