# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity focused on enhancing network stability and advancing the dispute resolution framework. Significant progress was made in resolving Flashblocks proxy stability issues and completing coordination with RPC providers to integrate a new node. Concurrently, development and discussion continued around dispute games, with updates to game templates and a key discussion on improving the reliability of `op-dispute-mon` when handling out-of-sync nodes. The project also saw operational progress with the execution of chain-specific tasks and an important update to the Data Availability footprint specification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week included operational updates, tooling improvements, and ongoing development of the dispute game mechanism.

- **Operational and Tooling Enhancements:**
  - Two tasks, `028-arena-z-main-u13-to-u16a` and `029-swell-main-u13-to-u16a`, were successfully marked as executed ([#1250](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1250)).
  - To improve usability, new validation instructions were added for the `op-txverify` tool ([#1251](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1251)).

- **Dispute Game Updates:**
  - A new pull request was opened to update `SetRespectedGameTypeTemplate.sol`, continuing the refinement of the dispute game system ([#1252](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1252)).

- **Documentation Maintenance:**
  - A pull request was submitted to fix a broken link to an Optimism blog article, ensuring documentation remains accurate ([#1249](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1249)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week centered on resolving Flashblocks integration problems and clarifying the status of ongoing work related to dispute games.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks Integration:** Two key issues related to Flashblocks were resolved. A stability issue causing loss of flashblocks in the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` was fixed ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17856)), and coordination with RPC providers for a new Flashblocks node was successfully completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17857)).
  - **Data Availability Specification:** The specification for DA footprint block limits was updated to use the `blobBaseFee` header field instead of modifying `gasUsed`, closing issue [#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/792).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Dispute Monitoring Reliability:** A critical discussion is ongoing in [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17814) on how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes. The current problem is that a lagging node is incorrectly detected as a disagreement. The proposed solution is to use a node's `syncStatus` to verify it has processed the L1 block where a dispute game was created before trusting its results, preventing false alarms.
  - **Dispute Game Implementation:** Issue [#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17257), related to the v2 dispute game implementation in `OPCM.deploy`, was reopened. A remaining `TODO` in the code indicates that this work is not yet complete.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
- **External Collaboration:** The successful resolution of the Flashblocks RPC coordination issue ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17857)) highlights effective collaboration with external RPC providers, including a planned integration by Blockscout.
- **Technical Discussions:** The detailed discussion in issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17814) demonstrates active, collaborative problem-solving around the core challenge of ensuring reliable dispute monitoring in a multi-node environment.
