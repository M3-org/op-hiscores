# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Sep 28 - Oct 4, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by a major operational success with the full enablement of Flashblocks on op-mainnet, complete with comprehensive onboarding, documentation, and public communication. Progress on cross-chain functionality was made by enabling L1 to L2 call execution via the Optimism Portal. The team also finalized the Isthmus upgrade and advanced testing for the upcoming Fusaka activation. An ongoing challenge remains with Cannon's incompatibility with Go 1.25, which is currently blocked by an upstream issue in the Go MIPS compiler.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on enhancing cross-chain capabilities, improving command performance, and managing chain operations.

- **L1 to L2 Call Execution:** A significant new feature was introduced to allow L1 to L2 call execution using the Optimism Portal. This change adds a new template and configuration-driven parameters, specifically enabling the dispatch of L2 calls from an L1 Safe ([#1231](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1231)).
- **Chain & Task Management:** A new task was added to facilitate the Worldchain key handback process ([#1235](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1235)).
- **Performance and Tooling:** Base commands were optimized for faster execution ([#1241](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1241)), and an example task was updated to pin a block number, resolving a CI failure ([#1240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1240)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The team closed out several major operational and testing issues while identifying new areas for developer experience improvement and tracking a significant external dependency.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Rollout Completed:** A series of issues related to the Flashblocks rollout were closed, marking a significant milestone. This includes the successful live enablement on op-mainnet, completion of on-call onboarding and documentation, refinement of alerts, and the publication of a blog post detailing the deployment ([#16498](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16498), [#17142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17142), [#17664](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17664), [#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17423)).
    - **Protocol Upgrades & Testing:** The main tracking issue for the Isthmus upgrade was closed, confirming its completion ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/12703)). Additionally, a test for Fusaka (Osaka) activation on L1 was successfully implemented ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17500)).
    - **Bug Fixes & Refinements:** A race condition in the `op-node` EngineController was resolved by applying proper locking ([#17564](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17564)), and acceptance test reporting was improved to include setup information in the HTML output ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/386)).
    - **Strategic Closures:** An issue to refactor the `op-node` CLI was closed as "not planned" ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16680)), and an issue for chain configuration negative testing was closed due to a strategic shift to a report-based validation approach ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/686)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Developer Experience:** A new issue was opened to improve `justfile` command input validation, aiming to provide more helpful error messages and enhance the developer workflow ([#1236](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1236)).
    - **Go 1.25 Compatibility Blocker:** Discussions continued on Cannon's incompatibility with Go 1.25, which causes incorrect Keccak hashes. The problem is blocked by an issue in the Go compiler, as the necessary MIPS fix was not included in the Go 1.25.1 release ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17060)).
    - **Devnet Strategy:** The integration of `op-reth` is being re-evaluated. With the Kurtosis devnet now deprecated, the focus has shifted to integrating `op-reth` into the `devstack` or `sysgo` systems instead ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17475)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's activity highlights strong internal collaboration, particularly in the successful cross-functional rollout of Flashblocks. The resolution of issues related to alerts and test reporting, with references to pull requests in the `k8s` and `infra` repositories, demonstrates effective cross-repository coordination. Active discussions on complex issues like the Go 1.25 compatibility problem show a deep engagement in diagnosing and tracking external dependencies that impact the project.
