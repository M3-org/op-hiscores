# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on configuration management and preparation for future network upgrades. Key progress was made in configuring the Soneium Testnet by setting its `GameType` to Permissionless. Work also began on new templates to streamline vault upgrades and revenue share opt-ins, alongside an upgrade proposal for Worldchain Sepolia. Discussions around active issues were prominent, focusing on the implementation of the DA Footprint Limit, potential breaking changes in `rollupConfig`, and tooling improvements for local development.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on testnet configurations and introducing new operational templates.

- **Soneium Testnet Configuration:** The Permissionless game type (type 0) was configured for Soneium Testnet Minato. This involved adding the necessary tasks, configuration files, and validation documentation to ensure the testnet operates correctly ([#1256](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1256), [#1255](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1255)).

- **New Operational Templates:** To improve chain management, new templates were introduced for handling vault upgrades and revenue share opt-in functionalities ([#1257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1257)). A related effort was started to add more assertions to these templates to prevent misconfigurations ([#1259](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1259)).

- **Chain Upgrade Preparation:** A pull request was opened to manage the upgrade of Worldchain Sepolia from version U12 to U16a ([#1258](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1258)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week, but several critical discussions progressed on active issues, highlighting future work and potential blockers.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Blockers and Dependencies:** The implementation of the DA Footprint Limit ([#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17551)) remains blocked, awaiting a required spec derivation.
    - **API Stability:** A significant discussion is ongoing in [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17907) regarding `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` marshaling. The team is weighing options to avoid breaking zk stacks, debating whether to delay marshaling new fields or update dependent repositories.
    - **Fusaka Upgrade Progress:** Preparations for the Fusaka upgrade are being tracked across multiple issues. The `op-geth` update is complete for Sepolia but still pending for Mainnet ([#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/682)). Similarly, the task to update the absolute prestate has been executed on Sepolia, with discussions on how to track the corresponding Mainnet task ([#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1206)).
    - **Tooling:** A `mise` installation error caused by a version prefix was reported in [#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17963). Separately, a discussion in [#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17942) is exploring whether to enhance `op-up` for local development or if simpler testing methods would suffice.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Discussions on active issues showcased collaborative problem-solving this week. The debate around `rollupConfig` marshaling ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17907)) involved multiple contributors weighing the technical trade-offs of different approaches to avoid uncoordinated API updates. Likewise, the conversation about the future of the `op-up` tool ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17942)) reflects a healthy dialogue on tooling strategy and developer experience.
