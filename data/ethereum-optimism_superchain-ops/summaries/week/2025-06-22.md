# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a dual focus on enhancing system stability and clearing a significant backlog of tooling and CI/CD improvements. Key efforts were directed at investigating performance issues in core components like `op-batcher` and `op-geth`, with new spikes initiated to address memory consumption and ongoing community collaboration to diagnose high CPU usage. A major code refactoring of `MultisigTask.sol` improved maintainability, while critical configuration updates were made for Sepolia. The team also undertook a substantial cleanup, closing dozens of older issues related to CI automation, testing infrastructure, and developer experience, signaling a concerted push to streamline the development lifecycle.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week spanned configuration updates, bug fixes, significant refactoring, and pipeline optimizations.

- **Superchain Configuration & Validation:**
  - Sepolia OPCM and Standard Validator addresses were updated to `rc.8` to align with the `op-contracts` v4.0.0 release candidate ([#1095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1095)).
  - Validation for Superchain upgrades was enhanced with detailed entries for Op and Ink contracts and improved state diff decoding for Unichain, including contract names and registry links ([#1104](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1104), [#1107](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1107)).

- **Bug Fixes & Tooling:**
  - A critical bug causing nonce bump issues for Base L1PAO and Base Ops Safe transactions was resolved, ensuring correct transaction execution ([#1102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1102)).
  - An error in how `justfiles` handled `signer_args` for `approve` and `execute` commands was fixed, resolving local execution failures ([#1103](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1103)).

- **Code Refactoring & Maintainability:**
  - A substantial refactoring of `MultisigTask.sol` was completed, removing child state variables to streamline the codebase. This change enhances clarity by passing state directly through functions ([#1085](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1085)).

- **Feature Development & Iteration:**
  - An initial implementation to add Trezor hardware wallet support was merged ([#1089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1089)) but was reverted the following day ([#1100](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1100)).

- **CI/CD Pipeline Optimization:**
  - The CI pipeline was improved by removing now-completed simulations for Mode and Metal ([#1098](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1098)).
  - Timeouts in CircleCI were increased for long-running jobs to prevent premature failures ([#1099](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1099)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a major effort to resolve outstanding issues while also opening new investigations into performance and stability.

- **Closed Issues:**
  A large volume of issues were closed, primarily focused on improving the developer workflow and testing infrastructure.
  - **CI/CD & Automation:** Numerous enhancements were completed, including automatic task execution in CI ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/337)), support for "stacked" proposals ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/342)), and CI job performance optimizations ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/648)). The spike to explore CI SLAs was also concluded with a decision not to implement them at this time ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16437)).
  - **Testing & Developer Experience:** Key problems resolved include enabling predeploy modification in Supersim ([#393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/393)), completing Flashblocks acceptance tests ([#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/354)), and improving nonce override UX ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/770)).
  - **Documentation:** Issues related to broken links ([#283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/283)) and bridging ERC-20 tokens with Viem ([#1508](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1508)) were addressed.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  Focus has shifted towards performance bottlenecks and component stability.
  - **Performance Investigation:** New issues were opened to investigate and optimize `op-batcher` memory consumption during L1 congestion ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16537)) and to add better memory observability via `pprof` ([#16572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16572)). The active discussion on abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` v1.101511.0 continues, with users providing diagnostic data ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/613)).
  - **Supervisor Stability:** An investigation was opened into event spikes in `op-supervisor` ([#16603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16603)). Discussions are also ongoing to improve the supervisor's reset behavior and L1 origin validity checks across different safety levels ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16314), [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16315), [#16321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16321)).
  - **Dependencies & UX:** A new issue was flagged for a broken `go-bip39` dependency in `op-chain-ops` ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16612)), and a potential UX problem causing nonce errors during multi-step transactions was reported ([#1106](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1106)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted active collaboration between the core team and the wider community of users and operators. The investigation into high `op-geth` CPU usage ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/613)) is a prime example, with multiple users reporting the issue and providing `pprof` profiles to aid in debugging. Internally, the discussion and decision-making process for the CI SLA spike ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16437)) demonstrated healthy debate among team members, weighing different perspectives on metrics and developer impact. The significant number of issues closed on a single day (June 26) suggests a coordinated team effort to reduce technical debt and improve the project's overall health.
