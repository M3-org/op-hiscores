# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Sep 21 - 27, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was defined by a major push to roll out the U16a upgrade across the Superchain. The team successfully upgraded multiple networks, including Metal, Mode, and Zora, while preparing and staging the upgrade for Base, OP Mainnet, and others. Alongside this large-scale operational effort, the core `superchain-ops` system received significant enhancements, including native support for direct L2 upgrade transactions and new templates for security operations. A substantial cleanup of legacy issues and code has streamlined the repository, solidifying the new ops system as the project's foundation and demonstrating a strong feedback loop by rapidly addressing operator workflow concerns.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This week's work focused on executing a broad network upgrade campaign, enhancing core tooling, and improving system reliability.

- **Superchain U16a Upgrade Campaign:** A coordinated effort was made to deploy the U16a upgrade.
    - **Execution:** Upgrades were successfully executed for Metal, Mode, Zora, Arena-Z, and Swell ([#1188], [#1189], [#1190], [#1191], [#1192]). On the Sepolia testnet, state differences were corrected [#1212] and several tasks were marked as executed [#1228].
    - **Preparation:** New U16a tasks were created for Base Mainnet [#1200]. Tasks for OP/Ink/Soneium and Unichain were set to "ready to sign" ([#1225], [#1226]), and the Base U16a upgrade was also marked as `READY TO SIGN` by the end of the week [#1234].

- **Core System Enhancements & New Templates:** The `superchain-ops` framework gained new capabilities.
    - **Direct L2 Upgrades:** The system now supports direct L2 upgrade transactions, a feature previously only available in the older system, enabling more efficient operations [#1187].
    - **New Templates:** A template was added to facilitate swapping Safe owners, crucial for security council rotations [#1219]. Another new template and example task were introduced for transferring L2PAO from L1 to an EOA [#1233].

- **Developer Experience and CI Stability:** Efforts were made to improve the operator and developer workflow.
    - **Debugging & CI:** Nonce error messages in CI were improved to display the task configuration file, speeding up debugging [#1215]. Retry mechanisms were added to `forge_test` and `template_regression_tests` to mitigate flakiness from RPC nodes [#1229].
    - **Documentation & Clarity:** Instructions were improved for importing Keystore wallets [#1214] and for the Base U16a upgrade, specifically targeting semi-technical users [#1232]. Feedback on the multisig signing process led to improvements in `MultisigTaskPrinter.sol` and `MultisigTask.sol` for better clarity [#1230].

- **Codebase Streamlining:** The repository was cleaned of legacy components. The `FinanceTemplate` [#1216] and the old `improvements` directory [#1217] were removed, reflecting the maturation of the current `superchain-ops` system.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was characterized by a massive cleanup of historical debt and a focus on improving the current operator experience.

- **Closed Issues:** A large number of legacy issues were closed, signaling a significant housekeeping effort. These closures related to:
    - **Architectural Cleanup:** Issues concerning the previous architecture, such as merging `VerificationBase` [#427] and making `SignFromJson` compatible with the Safe Web UI [#49], were resolved.
    - **Tooling Deprecation:** Issues related to the now-unused `sim-seq` feature ([#646], [#647]) and the move away from Kurtosis [#15265] were closed.
    - **CI & DevEx:** Long-standing issues around CI rate limits ([#569], [#628]) and developer tooling were addressed and closed.
    - **Security & Templates:** The issue to create a "Swap Owner Template" [#1167] was completed and closed.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Operator Workflow Feedback:** A critical new issue, [#1224], was opened, detailing several pain points in the `superchain-ops` signing flow. The feedback highlighted confusion around `TODOs` in simulation output, the "experimental" nature of audit reports, and the `op-txverify` requirement. This sparked an important discussion and led to immediate action.
    - **Fusaka Preparation:** An active discussion in [#17472] is focused on preparing the `op-batcher` for the Fusaka L1 hardfork, ensuring it correctly sends blob transactions with cell proofs.
    - **Engine API Validation:** A new issue [#688] was opened to address potential duplication of Engine API validation checks, proposing a refactor to streamline the logic.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The week highlighted a healthy and responsive collaboration dynamic within the project. The most notable example was the interaction around issue [#1224], where feedback from user `@geoknee` on the signing process was quickly acknowledged by maintainer `@blmalone`. The detailed discussion that followed resulted in a pull request [#1230] being merged within a day to address the reported "snags," demonstrating a tight and effective feedback loop between operators and the core development team. The coordinated rollout of the U16a upgrade across numerous PRs and chains also points to strong internal team alignment and execution.
