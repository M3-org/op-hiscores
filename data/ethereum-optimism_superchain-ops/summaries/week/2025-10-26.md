# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 28, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts were dominated by extensive preparations for the upcoming U17 network upgrade, with a coordinated push to open pull requests for numerous Superchain networks on both mainnet and Sepolia testnets. Alongside this major upgrade effort, development continued on improving core infrastructure robustness by enhancing template configuration validation and resolving a critical Flashblocks websocket timeout issue. Active investigation is also underway to address an `op-batcher` frame size issue in collaboration with the Celestia team, while new work was initiated to add Trezor hardware wallet support.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
While much of the week was focused on preparing new changes, one key improvement was merged and several significant new initiatives were started.

- **Configuration Validation Improvements:** To enhance system robustness, additional assertions were added to various templates to ensure they revert on bad configurations, preventing potential deployment errors ([#1259](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1259)).

- **U17 Upgrade Preparations:** A significant effort was made to prepare for the U17 upgrade across the Superchain. Ten new pull requests were opened to stage these changes for a wide array of networks, including:
    - **Mainnet:** OP, Soneium, Ink, Base, Unichain, Arena-Z, Swell, Metal, and Zora ([#1268](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1268), [#1272](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1272), [#1271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1271), [#1270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1270), [#1269](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1269)).
    - **Sepolia Testnets:** Base, Unichain, Arena-Z, Metal, Zora, OP, Soneium, and Ink ([#1267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1267), [#1266](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1266), [#1265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1265), [#1264](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1264), [#1263](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1263)).
    - **Development Networks:** A PR was also opened for OP betanets and sepolia-dev-0 ([#1273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1273)).

- **New Features & Tooling:** Work began on introducing Trezor hardware wallet support ([#1275](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1275)) and updating Foundry versions ([#1274](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1274)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened this week, but significant progress was made on closing existing ones and advancing discussions on active topics.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Infrastructure & Testing:** A persistent Flashblocks websocket timeout was identified as a Cloudflare/GCP issue and resolved ([#17858](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17858)). An issue tracking the need for more `op-deployer` end-to-end tests was closed, as sufficient integration tests have now been added ([#16842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16842)).
    - **Documentation:** Two documentation issues were resolved, fixing broken internal tutorial links and an incorrect `op-up` installation command ([#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1802), [#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1797)).
    - **Audit:** A Q4 2024 audit item was closed ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1789)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - The most notable active discussion revolves around the `op-batcher` max frame size when using alternative data availability (altDA) layers. Issues [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17796) and [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17872) are tracking the investigation and a potential fix from Celestia. A PR from Celestia to upstream the fix has been requested and is expected to be merged, representing important future work for altDA integration.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong cross-team collaboration. The active discussion and coordination with the Celestia team on the `op-batcher` DA size issue ([#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17872)) demonstrates a healthy partnership in solving interoperability challenges. Additionally, the coordinated rollout of ten U17 upgrade PRs across multiple Superchain partners indicates a high degree of internal alignment. Community engagement was also visible, with a contributor offering to help resolve further documentation issues ([#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1802)).
