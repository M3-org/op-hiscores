# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Aug 10 - 16, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on improving the developer experience and managing technical debt. A key initiative was opened to enhance the stability of the development workflow by addressing intermittent failures in forge scripts. Additionally, planning for future refactoring work began with the creation of an issue to migrate and clean up Fault Proof (FP) recovery tasks. Progress was also noted on an active issue related to event flow tracing, indicating steady work on foundational tooling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
