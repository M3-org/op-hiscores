# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Weekly Report (Jul 6 - 12, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was dominated by intensive preparations for the upcoming U16 upgrade. Development efforts were sharply focused on ensuring a smooth rollout, with numerous critical bug fixes for U16 configurations on both Sepolia and mainnet. The team successfully generated state diffs for multiple chains, executed preparatory runbooks, and enhanced devnet tooling for rehearsal. Alongside this upgrade work, significant refactoring of Gnosis Safe logic improved codebase modularity, and several long-standing issues related to node functionality and testing were resolved, clearing the path for future development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on bug fixes, upgrade preparations, and foundational code improvements.

### U16 Upgrade Preparations and Fixes
A significant push was made to prepare for the U16 upgrade, involving critical fixes and preparatory tasks across multiple chains.
- **Bug Fixes:** A series of crucial fixes were merged to ensure correct behavior. This included resolving a `config.toml` bug that affected normalized hash generation ([#1114]), adding a guardian nonce override to enable standalone simulation ([#1115]), and addressing configuration issues for DPM/DGM on U16 Sepolia ([#1113]) and mainnet ([#1123], [#1127]).
- **State Diff Generation:** As part of the upgrade process, state differences were generated for Op & Ink ([#1110]), Soneium ([#1111]), and Unichain ([#1112]).
- **Task Execution:** Several operational tasks were completed, including the execution of three U16 Sepolia runbooks ([#1117]) and marking the Unichain U16 Sepolia task as executed ([#1125]).
- **Devnet Enhancements:** To support testing, a new devnet task was introduced for gas parameter rehearsal, which included deploying a Gnosis Safe ([#1116]).

### Core Logic and Tooling Refinements
Improvements were made to core operational logic and development tooling to enhance maintainability and efficiency.
- **Gnosis Safe Refactoring:** Transaction encoding logic was refactored from `MultisigTask` into a dedicated `GnosisSafeHashes` library, improving modularity and reusability ([#1092]).
- **Task Execution:** A change was made to disable nonce checks on nested `just execute` commands, streamlining complex task execution ([#1119]).
- **Template Management:** A fix was implemented to rename a template by removing its version ([#1120]), and a new PR was opened to enforce adding the `op-contract` version to template names for better clarity ([#1118]).

### Maintenance and Configuration Updates
Minor but necessary maintenance and configuration changes were also addressed.
- **Cleanup:** Outdated U16 tasks and their associated configurations were removed to streamline the codebase ([#1109]).
- **Configuration:** Minor diffs were applied for a Minato upgrade ([#1108]), and a nonce was bumped for a Uniswap-related upgrade ([#1122]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of several key issues, reflecting a shift in priorities and successful mitigation efforts.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Node Functionality:** An issue to add pre-Interop logic to `op-node` was closed as it is no longer a priority ([#16520]). An `op-batcher` issue was closed due to inactivity ([#15355]).
    - **Configuration & Validation:** An issue regarding CrossL2Inbox configuration validation was closed, with the team determining that improvements in deployer tooling provided sufficient mitigation ([#15765]). The `flashblocks` gate in acceptance tests was confirmed to be working correctly ([#16630]).
    - **Testing & Documentation:** An issue focused on improving the reliability of acceptance tests was closed ([#16378]), as was a runbook for a v3 final review ([#16651]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this week.
    - **Fault Proofs:** Active discussion continues on the OPCM changes required for the Fault Proof creator contract, with a detailed checklist of remaining tasks outlined ([#15789]).
    - **Performance:** An investigation into abnormal CPU usage with `op-geth` ([#613]) is ongoing, with recent comments suggesting the issue may be related to a lengthy index update.
    - **Precompile Addresses:** Discussion on issue [#16620] clarified that initializing precompile addresses with a 1 wei balance is intentional to prevent them from being treated as empty accounts.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development activity this week demonstrated a highly coordinated and focused effort, particularly around the U16 upgrade. The rapid succession of related pull requests for bug fixes, state diff generation, and task execution points to strong internal alignment and efficient execution by the core team. Technical discussions on active issues, such as the detailed implementation plan for the Fault Proof creator contract ([#15789]) and clarifications on `op-stack` conventions ([#16620]), highlight a collaborative environment focused on resolving complex technical challenges.
