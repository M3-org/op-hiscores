# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Jul 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a crucial bug fix in `superchain-ops`, specifically addressing how configuration overrides are applied. This ensures that template developers can reliably assert on state overrides within the `_templateSetup` function, improving the robustness of development workflows.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Configuration Override Application Fix
A bug fix was implemented to ensure that configuration overrides are applied earlier in the process. This allows developers to assert on these overrides within the `_templateSetup` function, which is critical for proper template development and validation. This change impacts the `MultisigTask.sol` file. ([#1151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1151))
