# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Sep 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing AnchorStateRegistry (ASR) support for normalized hashes in V410, crucial for the speedrun template, and adding Mainnet U16a tasks for OP, Soneium, Ink, and Unichain.
## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### AnchorStateRegistry V410 Support
- Added support for normalized hashes in AnchorStateRegistry V410, ensuring consistent hash behavior for the speedrun template. ([#1209](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1209))

### Mainnet U16a Task Integration
- Introduced Mainnet U16a tasks for OPCM upgrade to V410, specifically for OP, Soneium, and Ink (sharing PAO), and a separate task for Unichain (due to its distinct PAO). ([#1201](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1201))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#1208](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1208), was opened for "Worldchain sepolia key handback over".

## CLOSED ISSUES

### op-acceptor Configuration and Parallelism Improvements
- The issue of logging all configuration at start-up and in the HTML report for `op-acceptor` was resolved. ([#461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/461))
- Improvements to `op-acceptor` package parallelism were completed, addressing the sub-optimal implementation that prevented `t.Parallel()` and `devtest.ParallelT()` from working correctly. ([#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/462))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node: Prepare for Fusaka
- Discussion continues on preparing `op-node` for Fusaka, specifically regarding derivation pipeline compatibility and converting excess blob gas into L1 cost. A key concern raised is the potential for frequent absolute prestate updates if tightly coupled to upstream Geth code. ([#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17493))
