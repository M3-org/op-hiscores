# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Sep 23, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the Superchain-ops system with direct L2 upgrade capabilities and introducing the U16a task for Base Mainnet. Significant cleanup efforts were also made by removing the `FinanceTemplate` and the `improvements` directory, streamlining the codebase.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain-ops System Enhancements and Streamlining
The Superchain-ops system received a significant upgrade, now supporting direct L2 upgrade transactions, a feature previously available in the older system. This enhancement allows for more direct and efficient L2 operations within the new framework ([#1187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1187)). Concurrently, the codebase was streamlined by removing the `FinanceTemplate`, which was not yet fully supported and required further development ([#1216](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1216)). The `improvements` directory, an artifact from an earlier version, was also removed as the new Superchain-ops system is now a first-class citizen ([#1217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1217)).

### New Task Introduction and Script Refinements
A new U16a task was created for Base Mainnet, expanding the operational capabilities for this chain ([#1200](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1200)). Additionally, the `get-rpc-url` script was refined for cleaner and more consistent functionality across various environments ([#1220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1220)). A small update was also made to the README for the `U16a-opcm-upgrade-v410-unichain` task ([#1221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1221)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Flashblocks Enablement on Sunnyside Sequencers
The issue [#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16761) regarding enabling flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers has been closed. The latest update from yashvardhan-kukreja confirms the completion of this task, referencing a pull request in the k8s repository ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/k8s/pull/7341](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/k8s/pull/7341)). Previously, yashvardhan-kukreja had provided an update on September 4th, stating that both Sunnyside sequencers had `op-rbuilder` deployed and synced, outlining the next steps which included deploying `rollup-boosts` in disabled mode, a backup sequencer without flashblocks, and then enabling `execution_mode` based on flashblocks-enablement's health.
