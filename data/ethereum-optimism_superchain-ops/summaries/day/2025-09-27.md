## ACTIVE ISSUES

### L2CL<>L2EL Syncing Conditions
Discussion continued on understanding the conditions for L2EL to start EL Syncing, particularly for `op-geth` with `op-sepolia`. The latest comments clarify that the EL client should simply sync, and the method (e.g., snap-sync vs. full block execution) is less critical than its ability to reach the new chain head after a FCU call. The ticket may be closed as this is potentially handled by `engineController.insertUnsafePayload` for avoiding `ReqRes` sync.
