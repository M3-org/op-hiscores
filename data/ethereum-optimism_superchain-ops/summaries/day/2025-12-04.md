## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-node` EL Sync Mode Issue
Discussion continued on an issue where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart when Reth already has synced data ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18468)). A user reported experiencing the same problem, blocking their Base Mainnet node. A temporary fix suggested was to change the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restart `op-node`.
