# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Jul 16, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on integrating Security Council Rehearsals with the new `superchain-ops` system and streamlining CI configurations. Several long-standing issues related to sequencer stability and package updates were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Security Council Rehearsal Integration
The initial step for integrating Security Council Rehearsals into the new `superchain-ops` system was implemented. This involved adding new rehearsal scripts, documentation, and related files, laying the groundwork for future rehearsal steps [#1121](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1121).

### CI Configuration Streamlining
Old CI configurations for rehearsals were removed, as CI for rehearsal templates will now be handled via the `just simulate-all-templates` CI job, aligning with the approach for other templates [#1130](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1130).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Sequencer Stability and Recovery
Several issues related to sequencer stability and recovery mechanisms were closed. This includes an issue concerning recovery from sequence window expiration incidents [#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/11228) and another addressing sequencer halting on temporary errors [#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/12240). An issue regarding the inability to start a new node with `op-node` was also closed [#15411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15411).

### Package and Test Updates
