## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolving `op-geth` Genesis File Initialization Panic
An issue concerning an `op-geth` panic when initializing with a large 7GB genesis file was closed today [#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/668). The resolution involved a strategy to avoid storing the large genesis state as a flat JSON blob and instead leverage the `stateHash` attribute for snap-syncing, similar to how op-mainnet operates.

### Improving `op-batcher` Throttling Metrics
An issue related to improving the `op-batcher`'s throttling intensity metric was closed [#17149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17149). The proposed solution involves a Grafana-side adjustment to only plot values greater than zero, making it easier to visualize active controllers.

### Kurtosis: Ability to Use Local `op-geth` Build
Discussion continued on enabling Kurtosis to use local `op-geth` builds [#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16975). The latest suggestion proposes leveraging the templating system to automatically resolve `op-geth` Docker images based on the `go.mod` githash, either by pulling pre-built images or by cloning source code and building locally.
