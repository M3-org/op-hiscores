## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Possible Bug in op-node Sequencer Recover Mode**: Discussion continued on [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18350), which describes a scenario where the op-node sequencer entered recover mode during normal operation, leading to "failed to fetch current L1 origin" errors on verifier nodes. The latest comment from geoknee on December 10th suggests that a relevant PR, [#18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233), might be related to the issue. Previous discussions highlighted that when the sequencer is in recover mode and the chain is healthy, it might request a non-existent L1 origin block, causing the L1 origin not to advance and potentially violating the sequencer drift rule. A possible fix snippet was also proposed by sebastianst to prevent temporary errors when recover mode reaches the tip.
