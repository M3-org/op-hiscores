# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Aug 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the CI/CD pipeline, significantly increasing test coverage across various components, and migrating blacklist game templates to the new templating framework.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD Pipeline Refinement
The CI configuration was cleaned up by removing obsolete jobs and tasks, streamlining the pipeline in preparation for a new superchain-ops system. This refactoring improves efficiency and maintainability. ([#1164](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1164))

### Enhanced Test Coverage
Significant progress was made in increasing test coverage across the codebase, particularly for `SimpleAddressRegistry.sol`, `StackedSimulator.sol`, and `TaskManager.sol`, as well as various test libraries and task-related tests. This effort aims to improve code robustness and reliability. ([#1166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1166))

### Template Migration
A new blacklist game template was created using the updated superchain-ops templating framework, marking a step towards migrating existing tasks to the new system. ([#1168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1168))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#1169](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1169), was opened to address a monorepo update.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Template Migration Progress
The issue concerning the migration of FP recovery tasks, specifically the blacklist games task, to the new template framework was closed. This indicates successful completion of the migration and removal of old tasks. ([#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1162))

## NEW ISSUES
