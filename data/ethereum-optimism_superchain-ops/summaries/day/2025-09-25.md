# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Sep 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing CI reliability with retry mechanisms, refining multisig task processes, and updating task statuses. Key updates include improved CircleCI stability and clearer documentation for Superchain operations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI Reliability Improvements
*   Implemented retry mechanisms for `forge_test` and `template_regression_tests` in CircleCI to mitigate flakiness from RPC nodes, ensuring more stable and reliable continuous integration processes ([#1229](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1229)).

### Multisig Task Refinements
*   Addressed feedback from issue #1224, improving the `MultisigTaskPrinter.sol` and `MultisigTask.sol` to enhance the user experience and clarity for multisig operations ([#1230](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1230)).
*   Updated README commands for Uni U16a tasks to ensure correctness for signers and facilitators, improving documentation for critical Superchain upgrades ([#1227](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1227)).

### Task Status and Configuration Updates
*   Updated the status of several Sepolia tasks to "executed" with corresponding Etherscan links, providing clear progress tracking for deployments ([#1228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1228)).
*   Added new configuration files for Fusaka (fus) and FOS (fos) rotations, preparing for upcoming operational changes ([#1222](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1222)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

## NEW ISSUES
### Engine API Validation Deduplication
*   A new issue was opened to address the duplication of Engine API validation checks within `Miner.prepareWork`, suggesting that many of these checks are already performed as part of the Engine API validation in `eth/catalyst/api_optimism.go` ([#688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/688)). The discussion suggests moving additional checks, such as those for force-included L1 attributes deposit transactions and Jovian's L1 attributes deposit data length, into the Engine API checks.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Feedback on Superchain-Ops Flow Improvements ([#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1224))
Discussion continued regarding feedback on the improved superchain-ops flow. Key points from the latest comments include:
*   **Signer Simulation:** @geoknee questioned if signers are expected to perform task simulation, implying that TODOs printed during simulation are part of the signer's UX. @blmalone clarified that while signers are expected to simulate, most check Tenderly links after running the `sign` command.
*   **TODOs in Simulation:** @blmalone explained that TODOs are intentionally printed during task simulation to guide task developers in creating `VALIDATION.md` files, especially for state diff sections. These TODOs are not printed during the actual signing process.
*   **Audit Reports:** The experimental nature of audit reports in the workflow was acknowledged, with a fix proposed to change the language around them.
*   **`op-txverify` Requirement:** The necessity of `op-txverify` for some signers but not others was highlighted as an area needing a solid decision.
*   **Markdown and Tenderly Links:** Suggestions were made to improve markdown quality and to retain Tenderly links for validating state diffs in non-OPCM upgrades.
*   **"Normalized State Diff Hash":** A request was made to include an explanation of what the "normalized state diff hash" is.

### op-batcher: prepare for Fusaka ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17472))
The discussion focused on the `op-batcher`'s behavior change when Fusaka activates on L1.
*   @geoknee provided a recipe for manual testing against a Fusaka L1, including a link to a Notion document detailing how to point a batcher at a Fusaka devnet. This is crucial for ensuring the batcher sends blob transactions with cell proofs instead of blob proofs post-Fusaka activation.
