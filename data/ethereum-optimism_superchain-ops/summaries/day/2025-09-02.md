## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona + Cannon Support in OPCM
Discussion on [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17285) revolves around the necessary changes in OPCM to support Kona + Cannon. The latest comment from ajsutton suggests that OPCM will need to support deploying the new game type, specifically updating a conditional block in `OPContractsManager.sol`. Earlier, pauldowman questioned if any changes were needed at all, indicating a need for confirmation before closing the issue.

### Kona + Cannon Support in op-dispute-mon
Issue [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17286) focuses on updating `op-dispute-mon` to support Kona + Cannon game types. The latest comment from pauldowman clarifies the issue's objective to "Update to support cannon-kona games." Previously, ajsutton emphasized that `dispute-mon` must return an error for unsupported game types and that it needs to be updated to explicitly support cannon-kana game types, rather than just looking at specific game types.
