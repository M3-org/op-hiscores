# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Jun 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating Sepolia OPCM and Standard Validator addresses to rc.8, alongside significant progress in closing several long-standing issues related to CI/CD improvements, testing infrastructure, and task management.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

- **Sepolia Configuration Updates**: Critical addresses for Sepolia OPCM and Standard Validator were updated to rc.8, ensuring compatibility with the latest `op-contracts` v4.0.0 release candidate. This involved modifications to multiple configuration files and validation documentation. ([#1095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1095))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

- **CI/CD and Task Automation Enhancements**: Several issues related to continuous integration, task simulation, and automation were closed. This includes implementing automatic task execution in CI for non-terminal states ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/337)), supporting "stacked" proposals with incrementing nonces ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/342)), and optimizing CI job performance for template regression tests ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/648)). Improvements were also made to ensure `SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER` checks for a value of `1` ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/448)) and to verify domain hashes from simulation against `VALIDATIONS.md` entries ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/679)).
- **Documentation and Path Refinements**: Updates were made to ensure correct paths in improvement documentation ([#548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/548)) and to align task paths for mainnet operations ([#600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/600)). The `fetch-task` script was updated to use the mainnet task directory ([#547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/547)), and an example for OPCM template under `improvements/tasks/example/eth` was created ([#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/651)).
- **Testing and Template System Improvements**: Efforts to enhance the testing framework and template system were completed. This involved updating tests to utilize `contracts-bedrock` safe-tools and `stdStorage` library ([#605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/605)), and ensuring templates check against `StandardValidator` contracts ([#838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/838)). The `MultisigTask` architecture was revisited for better readability and maintainability ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/636)).
- **User Experience and Validation Enhancements**: Several issues aimed at improving the developer and user experience were closed. This includes providing a simple UX for users to override Nonces ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/770)), printing state diffs in markdown format ([#777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/777)), and addressing an issue where `StateOverrideManager` always added the nonce as a state override ([#814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/814)). Additionally, prevalidations were made possible without hindrance from the address registry's availability ([#654](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/654)), and a quick way to read addresses for chains not in the superchain registry was added ([#923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/923)).
- **Miscellaneous Closures**: Other closed issues include the completion of training calls and Loom videos for the new `superchain-ops` tooling ([#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/514)), and the closure of a test for Sepolia task to transfer owner of ProtocolVersions as templates for L1/L2 owner transfers are now implemented ([#554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/554)). Hash verifiability was also improved by printing input data and nested hashes for easier computation ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/686)). More granular checking of `addresses.json` was implemented to reduce the frequency of `scr` submodule updates ([#753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/753)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **OP Stack Release Pipeline Automation**: Discussions continue on using GoReleaser for `op-node/batcher/proposer/challenger` release pipelines ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16097)). The focus is on automating release notes generation, with suggestions for `git-cliff` and integrating it into `op-workbench`. Concerns were raised about adding a new build system without removing existing ones, advocating for a unified monorepo-first approach to avoid further complexity.
- **OP-Geth CPU Usage**: Users are reporting abnormal CPU usage with the latest `op-geth` v1.101511.0 ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/613)). Initial speculation points to a temporary spike due to log index rebuilding after a backport from `go-ethereum` v1.15.11. Users are sharing pprof data to diagnose the issue, with some noting that CPU usage returns to normal after the index upgrade completes.
- **Multisig Terminal Output Refactoring**: There's an ongoing effort to refactor `signFromChildMultisig` to reduce noisy terminal output ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/781)). Community members are actively proposing solutions, such as removing or selectively reducing `print` calls within `simulateRun` to improve focus on critical signing information.
- **Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet**: A discussion is clarifying the differences between `supersim` and `interop kurtosis devnet` for local development ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/399)). It was confirmed that `supersim` is a lighter-weight `anvil` wrapper primarily for testing multichain/interop applications, while Kurtosis is used for testing the chains themselves.
