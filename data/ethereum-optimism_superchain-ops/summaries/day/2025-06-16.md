### CI Pipeline SLAs and Accountability Framework
Discussion continued on [#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16437) regarding the implementation of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for the CI pipeline. On June 16th, scharissis outlined a detailed proposal for CI Pipeline SLAs and an Accountability Framework, covering availability, performance, and developer experience metrics, along with a responsibility matrix for bad test resolution. The proposal aims to set clear expectations, provide measurable targets for the Platforms team, and objectively discuss CI health.

### Configurable Dependency Set for Supersim
The discussion on [#361](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/361) revolved around making the dependency set in supersim configurable. On June 16th, tremarkley suggested a `--dependency-set <chains>` flag to allow specifying which chains should be part of a dependency set, providing a link to the dependency set specification and a starting point in the monorepo for implementation. its-everdred requested an example of the flag and its expected effect.
