## ACTIVE ISSUES

### ZK Game Challenging Strategy
Discussion on [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18322) concluded with the decision to support ZK games within `op-challenger`. The latest comment confirms this direction, noting that the challenger logic is straightforward enough for reimplementation in `op-challenger`, even if a Rust challenger might be used long-term.

### SuperchainConfig Type Porting
The issue [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/741) regarding porting the `SuperchainConfig` type from `superchain-registry` saw recent activity. A PR ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/867)) has been opened to address this, following a comment from `emhane` clarifying that the notation for the type definition should not use Go syntax and should align with existing type definitions in the specs.
