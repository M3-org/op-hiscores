### ZK Game Challenge Support
Discussions on [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18322) concluded with the decision to support ZK games within `op-challenger`.

The latest comment indicates that a PR ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/867)) has been opened to address this, following a clarification on the required notation for the type definition.
