## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a key update to the Superchain registry to resolve a test failure, alongside the closure of several long-standing issues related to Superchain Registry 2.0 and Fusaka. Discussions continued on various active issues concerning op-node sync, op-supervisor, and event system refactoring.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
