# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a key update to the superchain registry to resolve a test failure, alongside the closure of several long-standing issues related to hardfork management and CI improvements. Several new pull requests were opened, focusing on testing and development environment enhancements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Registry Updates
A critical update was made to the superchain registry to address a test failure, specifically removing a chain with ID 2192 that was no longer present in the registry. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the registry data.
- Update registry to latest ([#1299](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1299))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Test Improvements:** Two pull requests were opened to enhance integration tests: "test: improve integration (#78)" ([#1302](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1302)) and "test: improve integration" ([#1301](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1301)).
- **Development Environment Configuration:** A pull request was opened to add `jq` to `mise.toml` with the same version as the monorepo ([#1300](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1300)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Hardfork Management and Registry Refinements
Several issues related to hardfork management and the superchain registry were closed, indicating progress in streamlining these processes. This includes making it easier for chains to opt into hardforks and addressing the relevance of L2 key handover tests after the SCR 2.0 refactor.
- fusaka-defense: write superchain-ops task for updating the absolute prestate ([#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1206))
- modify the `add-chain` tool / flow to allow chains to opt in to receive hardforks ([#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/610))
- investigate L2 key handover test ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/643))

### CI and Tooling Enhancements
An issue concerning the clarity of CI job summaries was closed, with the resolution attributed to the SCR 2.0 refactor.
- ci: update `golang-validate-all` job to give summary of passes/failures ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/644))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop and Sync Mechanism Refinements
Several issues related to the `op-node`'s synchronization and interoperability features were reopened. These issues, including [#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16141) (op-node: Let sync-start not cross into Interop activation), [#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16140) (Interop: Remove anchor point RPC), and [#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16174) (op-supervisor: Drop multi-node support), were initially closed but reopened due to existing TODOs in the codebase referencing them. The discussion highlights a need to track these items more formally through GitHub issues rather than inline code comments.

### Event System and Supervisor Clean-up
Issues concerning the `op-supervisor` and the event system refactor were also reopened due to outstanding TODOs. Specifically, [#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16917) (Clean up Event System Refactor Comments) and [#16245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16245) (op-supervisor: remove check-access-list backward compat chainID fallback) indicate ongoing work to refine and clean up these core components.

### Fusaka Design Finalization
The issue [#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/355) (fusaka-on-l2: finalize design) remains active, with the latest comment indicating that finalization will occur after checking with customers.

### EL Sync and Safe Head Advancement
Issues [#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17631) (op-node: On the Initial EL Sync UX and Correctness), [#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18124) (op-node: Safe Head Advancement during EL Sync), and [#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18125) (op-node: Unsafe not rewound while `INVALID` during EL Sync) are being punted until the full deprecation of Request/Response Sync. The discussions highlight edge cases and potential issues during initial EL sync and safe head advancement.

### Devstack Address Book Fix
Issue [#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15817) (op-devstack: sysext: fix address book) was reopened due to remaining TODOs, indicating that the `sysext` address book still needs to be updated to reflect changes in the local devnet description.
