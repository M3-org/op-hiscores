# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Jun 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing validation for Superchain upgrades, specifically for the Op and Ink contracts and Unichain state diffs. Discussions on active issues covered supervisor reset behavior, L1 origin validity, and op-geth CPU usage.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Upgrade Validation Enhancements
Detailed validation entries were added for the updated Op and Ink contracts, and Unichain state diff validation was enriched with contract names and storage decoding, including proper contract names and registry links for newly deployed contracts and complete DelayedWETHProxy sections.

## NEW ISSUES

### Dependency Issues
A new issue was opened regarding a broken dependency for `github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39` in `op-chain-ops`, noting that the `cosmos/go-bip39` fork's latest version is `v1.0.0` while `op` uses `v1.1.0`.

### Supervisor Event Spikes
An investigation was initiated into spikes of `local-derived` and other events in `op-supervisor`, with speculation that it might be related to `ChainsDB` or `GlobalSyncExec` deadlocks.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Supervisor Reset Behavior and L1 Origin Validity
Discussions continued on improving `op-supervisor`'s reset unsafe target and L1 origin validity handling. For [#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16314), it was noted that partial implementation has occurred, but it still lacks handling pre- and post-Interop differently. For [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16315), it was highlighted that a L1 origin verifier method now exists at the supervisor side, but it's currently only used for local unsafe and needs to be extended to safe heads. The issue [#16321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16321) on improving reorg behavior during resets was updated, stating that while local unsafe head L1 origin is checked, other safety levels are not.

### Abnormal CPU Usage with op-geth
The issue of abnormal CPU usage with `op-geth` v1.101511.0 [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/613) saw continued discussion. Users reported persistent high CPU usage even after index upgrades, suggesting a potential broken goroutine. Instructions for generating pprof profiles were shared to aid in debugging, with one user speculating that the high CPU usage is temporary due to log index rebuilding.
