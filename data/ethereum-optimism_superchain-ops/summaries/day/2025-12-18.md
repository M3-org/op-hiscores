# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining production configurations for revenue sharing tasks and updating test statuses, alongside internal repository maintenance.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Production Configuration Refinements for Revenue Sharing
Significant updates were made to production configurations for revenue sharing tasks, replacing example values with final production settings. This involved adjusting `upgradeAndSetup` tasks to exclude OP and `setupRevShare` tasks to exclude Ink and Soneium, streamlining the deployment process for these specific chains. ([#1318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1318))

### Test Status and Repository Maintenance
The status of the Soneium testnet FP task was updated with an execution link, improving test traceability. Additionally, the `CODEOWNERS` file for the `src/tasks/sep` directory was updated to prevent blocking other teams from merging into this task directory. ([#1321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1321), [#1322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1322))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Kona Interop Action Tests Re-enabled
The issue concerning disabled Kona interop action tests has been resolved. The tests are now re-enabled, though they do not yet block CI. This will be addressed once Kona migrates to the Optimism monorepo. ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18613))

## NEW ISSUES
### Op-Challenger Trace Output Review
A new issue has been opened to review the correct trace output in `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found. This involves evaluating the behavior of the super root provider when intermediate steps between two super roots are encountered and the next super root is unavailable. ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18643))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18574))
Discussions continued regarding the necessity of an additional deposit transaction for proofs in the interop protocol. The latest comments indicate a consensus towards simplifying the protocol by removing this additional transaction. @Inphi confirmed alignment with @ajsutton on simplifying the spec, noting that the replacement transaction is unnecessary for ZK proofs as a ZK program execution is proven by running derivation and a verification step. @ajsutton previously highlighted downsides of the super node just recording data, such as lack of consensus checks and data availability issues, but believes these become less of a concern with ZK proofs. @rdin777 summarized the consensus to simplify the protocol and requested architectural refactoring and an update to the Interop specification. @axelKingsley questioned the necessity of the additional transaction if the Supernode can supply the required data, treating its recorded denylists as a "SafeDB for replacements." @ajsutton had previously argued that the additional transaction is critical for the proofs system to avoid re-running derivation for the top half of the game, and that there's no real risk of exceeding the block gas limit.
