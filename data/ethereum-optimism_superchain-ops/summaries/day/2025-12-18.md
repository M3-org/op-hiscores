# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining production configurations for revenue sharing tasks and updating test statuses, alongside internal repository maintenance.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Production Configuration Refinements for Revenue Sharing
Significant updates were made to production configurations for revenue sharing tasks, replacing example values with final production settings. This included adjusting which chains are included in `upgradeAndSetup` and `setupRevShare` example tasks to reflect current operational needs. ([#1318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1318))

### Test Status and Repository Maintenance
The status of the Soneium testnet FP task was updated with an execution link, ensuring accurate tracking of test progress. Additionally, the `CODEOWNERS` file for the `src/tasks/sep` directory was updated to streamline team collaboration and prevent merge blocks. ([#1321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1321), [#1322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1322))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kona Interop Action Tests Re-enabled
The issue concerning disabled Kona interop action tests was closed today. The tests are now re-enabled, though they do not yet block CI. Plans are in place to make them a blocker once Kona migrates to the Optimism monorepo. ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18613))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18574))
Discussions continued regarding the necessity of an additional transaction for replacement blocks in the interop protocol. The latest comments indicate a consensus to simplify the protocol by removing the additional deposit transaction for proofs. This decision is driven by the understanding that a ZK proof generation would re-run the derivation process, making the replacement transaction unnecessary for ZK dispute games. The next steps involve assigning someone to architecturally refactor this mechanism and updating the Interop specification to reflect how the Superlayer will generate necessary data without the additional deposit.

### op-challenger: Review correct trace output when next super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18643))
This issue, opened today, highlights a potential problem with the `op-challenger`'s trace output when the next super root is not found. The discussion points out that the `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash on the first chain with insufficient data, suggesting that the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test might be incorrect. There's also a question about the `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC's behavior, specifically whether it returns a "not found" error if any chain isn't supported by L1, even if the supervisor's superroot RPC is otherwise okay with returning super roots for blocks that aren't cross-safe.
