The issue regarding reporting unused acceptance tests, [#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16273), was closed. The decision was made as the team has largely switched to using gateless mode, rendering the original requirement less relevant.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Documentation
Discussion continued on the issue [#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1742), which focuses on documenting the DA Footprint Limit. The latest comment suggests that this issue could be tracked alongside [[DOCS] Begin documenting MinBaseFee feature docs#1710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1710) in the `docs` repository, noting that the topic is relatively self-explanatory. The issue emphasizes the importance of documenting risks associated with setting the scalar too high or too low, and its interaction with gas limit changes.
