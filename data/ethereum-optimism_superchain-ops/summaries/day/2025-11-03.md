## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Documentation
Discussion continued on the documentation for the DA Footprint Limit, [#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1742). The latest comment suggests that this issue could be tracked alongside the documentation of the MinBaseFee feature, as it is considered self-explanatory. The issue emphasizes the importance of documenting risks associated with setting the scalar too high or too low and its interaction with gas limit changes.
