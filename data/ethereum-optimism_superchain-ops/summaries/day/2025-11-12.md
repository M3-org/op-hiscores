# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on adding regression tests, fixing a path in the README, and significant work on the U17 Base Sepolia and Sepolia stack upgrades, involving numerous configuration and documentation files.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD and Testing Improvements
- Regression tests were re-added to the CI configuration to ensure code stability and prevent regressions ([#1288](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1288)).

### Documentation and Readme Fixes
- A small fix was implemented to correct paths within the `README.md` file, improving documentation accuracy ([#1290](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1290)).

### U17 Sepolia Stack Upgrades
- Extensive work was done on the Jovian U17 upgrade task for Base Sepolia, involving updates to numerous configuration, README, and validation files across multiple tasks ([#1267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1267)).
- Further updates were made to the U17 Sepolia stack, ensuring no more than two chains per task, impacting various `.env`, `README.md`, `VALIDATION.md`, and `config.toml` files for several chains ([#1286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1286)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#1289](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1289), was opened to add a rehearsal task for a governance upgrade.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kona Action Test Completion
- The issue regarding ensuring Kona has passing action tests for Jovian was closed, as Jovian action tests have been added to `op-e2e/actions/proofs` and are now run by Kona's CI ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17303)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Optimizing Safe-Head Advancement
- **Issue:** `op-node: single aggregate safe-head advancement FCU message per channel` ([#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15393))
- **Discussion:** The issue concerns the excessive number of FCU (ForkchoiceUpdated) messages sent by the `op-node` when `batcher` runs with a considerable `--max-channel-duration`, leading to "FCU spam."
- **Latest Updates:**
    - A recent merge (https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18234) might help mitigate this issue (teddyknox, 2025-11-12).
    - `kona-node` has implemented a solution to send only one FCU per span batch in the happy-path, with an exception for Holocene forwards-invalidation (clabby, 2025-08-01).
    - The problem is potentially related to only advancing the safe head after a full channel or L1 block has been derived (sebastianst, 2025-05-16).
    - The FCU spam occurs because every pending safe update event triggers an FCU with `Concluding = true`. It's suggested that only the final pending safe update should have `Concluding = true` (SozinM, 2025-05-15).
    - More context was provided on the frequency of `decoded singular batch from channel` logs correlating with FCU calls (SozinM, 2025-05-14).
    - There was a discussion about why FCU calls are not sent with the `no_tx_pool` flag set when they are made in quick succession (ferranbt, 2025-05-01).
    - The impact of RTT on sending multiple FCUs was highlighted, noting that while fast locally, it can be prohibitively long with higher RTT (0x416e746f6e, 2025-04-14).
    - A debounce mechanism for the engine-controller FCU code was suggested, though its effectiveness in saving time compared to actual block processing was questioned (protolambda, 2025-04-14).

### Documenting `cannonKonaPrestate` for Upgrades
- **Issue:** `Document cannonKonaPrestate requirement for upgrades` ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18095))
- **Discussion:** The issue highlights the need to document that standard chains should always set the `cannon-kona` prestate, even though `opcm.upgrade` doesn't enforce it.
- **Latest Updates:**
    - The devrel team agrees that this requirement should be highlighted in the Optimism documentation, especially as it's a concern for the upcoming U18 upgrade. Updates will follow once the documentation is set up (Inphi, 2025-11-12).

### Improving Batcher Update Safeguards
- **Issue:** `Improve safe guards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig` ([#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18246))
- **Discussion:** This feature request aims to enhance safeguards when updating the batcher configuration on the SystemConfig.
- **Latest Updates:**
    - A related or similar issue, https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17490, was noted (geoknee, 2025-11-12).
