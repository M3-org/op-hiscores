# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in preparing for the U17 upgrade across multiple Sepolia chains, alongside the reintroduction of regression tests and a minor documentation fix.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### U17 Upgrade Preparations for Sepolia Chains
Extensive work was completed to prepare various Sepolia chains for the U17 upgrade, with tasks structured to handle no more than two chains per task. This involved creating and updating numerous configuration and validation files for different chains like Base Sepolia, Arena-Z, Sony, Ink, Metal Mode, Zora, Uni, and Soneium. ([#1267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1267), [#1286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1286))

### Regression Test Reintroduction
Regression tests were added back into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure the stability and correctness of the codebase. ([#1288](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1288))

### Documentation Refinement
A small fix was implemented to correct paths within the README file, improving the accuracy of the documentation. ([#1290](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1290))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#1289](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1289), was opened to add a rehearsal task for a governance upgrade.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kona Action Test Assurance
The issue regarding ensuring Kona has passing action tests for Jovian was closed, with the resolution that Jovian action tests were added to `op-e2e/actions/proofs` and are now run by Kona's CI. ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17303))

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Optimizing Safe-Head Advancement in op-node
Discussion continues on [#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15393) regarding the `op-node` sending a single aggregate safe-head advancement FCU message per channel. The latest comment from teddyknox points to a recently merged PR ([#18234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18234)) that may help address the issue. Earlier comments from clabby noted that `kona-node` has already implemented a solution to send only one FCU per span batch in the happy-path. The problem stems from frequent FCU spam when the `batcher` runs with a considerable `--max-channel-duration`, leading to multiple `PromoteLocalSafeEvent` calls. The conversation also touched upon the performance implications of numerous FCU calls, especially when the Execution Layer (EL) is not local.

### Documenting cannonKonaPrestate Requirement
On [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18095), the need to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades is being discussed. Inphi provided an update, stating that after discussions with devrel, it was agreed to highlight this requirement in the Optimism documentation, particularly for the U18 upgrade.

### Improving Batcher Update Safeguards
Issue [#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18246) focuses on improving safeguards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig. geoknee noted that this issue is somewhat related to [#17490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17490).
