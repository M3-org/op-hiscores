# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Dec 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in resolving critical operational and documentation issues. Several long-standing issues related to node synchronization and JSON-RPC API documentation were closed, improving the stability and usability of the Superchain.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Node Synchronization and Upgrade Resolution
A critical issue where `op-node` v1.16.3 failed to synchronize for Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments was resolved. The solution involved upgrading and resyncing `op-geth`, confirming that the issue was addressed and operations returned to normal. ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18510))

### Documentation Improvements for Node Operators
Two key documentation issues were closed, enhancing the clarity and completeness of resources for node operators. The JSON-RPC API documentation was updated and broken into separate `op-node` and `op-geth` pages, improving its structure and accuracy. Additionally, a previous gap where environment variables corresponding to flags for `op-node` and `op-geth` were missing from the documentation was fixed, making configuration easier for operators. ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1773), [#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1874))

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-node Synchronization Failure ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18510))
The issue regarding `op-node` v1.16.3 failing to synchronize was resolved today. The user `J1a-wei` confirmed that upgrading and resyncing `op-geth` fixed the problem. Previously, `geoknee` had suggested upgrading `op-geth` to v1.101603.5 and requested more detailed logs and metrics to diagnose the synchronization problem, noting that the initial log line was not uncommon after an `op-node` restart. `J1a-wei` had initially provided the versions of `op-geth` and `op-node` being used.
