# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Dec 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in resolving critical operational and documentation issues. Several long-standing issues related to node synchronization and JSON-RPC API documentation were closed, improving the stability and usability of the Superchain.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Node Synchronization and Upgrade Resolution
A critical issue where `op-node` v1.16.3 failed to synchronize for Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments was resolved. The solution involved upgrading and resyncing `op-geth`, which successfully addressed the synchronization problem. This fix ensures the stability and operational continuity of Superchain deployments [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18510).

### Documentation Improvements for Node Operators
Two key documentation issues were addressed, enhancing the clarity and completeness of resources for node operators. The JSON-RPC API documentation was updated and restructured to provide separate pages for `op-node` and `op-geth`, improving accessibility and accuracy [#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1773). Additionally, the documentation for environment variables corresponding to `op-node` and `op-geth` flags was restored, making it easier for operators to configure their nodes [#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1874).

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Node Synchronization Challenges with op-node v1.16.3
Issue [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18510) details a critical problem where `op-node` v1.16.3 failed to synchronize for Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments after an upgrade from v1.16.2. The latest comment confirms that upgrading and resyncing `op-geth` resolved the issue, indicating a dependency or compatibility problem between the `op-node` and `op-geth` versions. Earlier discussions involved requests for more detailed logs and metrics, and a recommendation to upgrade `op-geth` to v1.101603.5. This issue is now closed.
