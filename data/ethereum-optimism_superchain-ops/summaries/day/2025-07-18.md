# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Jul 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on minor bug fixes and performance improvements, alongside addressing issues related to acceptance tests and network topology. A key bug fix involved updating README files for the U16 upgrade, and a performance enhancement was made in state diff decoding. Several issues related to acceptance testing and network configuration were also discussed and some closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation and Upgrade Validation Improvements
*   Updated README and validation files for the U16 upgrade, specifically for opcm-upgrade-v400-op-ink, opcm-upgrade-v400-soneium, and opcm-upgrade-v400-uni, ensuring accuracy and completeness for ongoing improvements. ([#1134](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1134))
*   Added missing `approvedHashes` entries in validation files for enabling and removing DPM/DGM, crucial for correct system operation. ([#1135](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1135))

### Performance Enhancements
*   Implemented a small performance improvement in state diff decoding by optimizing the `AccountAccessParser.sol` to avoid redundant calls to `getStateDiffFor`. ([#1138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1138))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#1136](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1136): A new pull request was opened to add a fallback `address.json` file to all test tasks, aiming to improve performance.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Resolution
*   The issue concerning failing acceptance tests due to an `op-geth` version bump was closed. The problem was identified as related to `TestExecMessageInvalidAttributes` and `TestRegularMessage`, which were temporarily skipped. ([#16731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16731))
*   The general acceptance test for interop networks was closed, with the resolution that it will be handled by the Protocol team. ([#298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/298))

## NEW ISSUES
*   No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Topology Alignment
*   **[#16746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16746) Match acceptance test topology to real world topology**: This issue highlights a divergence between the current local Kurtosis interop devnet, which exposes the sequencer to the public, and the production topology. The goal is to align the test environment with production, including adding `proxyd` and verifier nodes. The issue stems from an `op-geth` sequencer in the interop Kurtosis devnet not setting the proper flag, leading to test failures. The discussion indicates a focus on making the Kurtosisnet YAML description match production.
