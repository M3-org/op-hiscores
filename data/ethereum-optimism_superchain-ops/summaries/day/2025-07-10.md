### CrossL2Inbox Configuration Validation
Issue [#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15765), concerning the validation of CrossL2Inbox configuration in the L2 genesis state, was closed. The team determined that the risk of incorrect genesis generation has been sufficiently mitigated by improvements in the `op-deployer` tooling, making client-side validation less critical.
