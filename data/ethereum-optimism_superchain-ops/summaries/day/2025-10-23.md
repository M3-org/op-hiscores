# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Oct 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on preparing for upcoming upgrades with new template pull requests. An active issue regarding a flaky test is being investigated, and a previously identified issue concerning forwards-compatible gameType retrieval was closed as it was addressed through other work.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Upgrade Template Preparation
*   New templates were introduced to facilitate future upgrades, specifically for V220 to V410 and the Jovian upgrade. These templates are crucial for ensuring smooth transitions and compatibility across different versions of the Superchain.
    *   [#1261](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1261)
    *   [#1260](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1260)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   **Upgrade Template Updates:** Two new pull requests were opened today, both focusing on upgrade templates. [#1261](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1261) proposes an update to the V220toV410 template, while [#1260](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1260) introduces a template for the Jovian upgrade. Both are currently open and awaiting review.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Game Type Retrieval Modernization
*   The issue concerning forwards-compatible gameType retrieval in OPCM ([#17933](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17933)) has been closed. It was determined that the necessary changes were implicitly handled as part of other development efforts, with current OPCM and standard validator calls to `gameType()` now primarily confined to V1-specific contexts.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flaky Test Investigation
*   The issue regarding a flaky test, `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17966)), remains active. The latest comment indicates that the developer is currently unable to reproduce the failure locally and has requested links to previous failures for further investigation.
