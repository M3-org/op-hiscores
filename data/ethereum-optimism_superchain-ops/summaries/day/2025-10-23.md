### OPCM Game Type Retrieval
Issue [#17933](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17933), concerning forwards-compatible gameType retrieval in OPCM, was closed. The discussion indicated that the necessary changes were likely implemented as part of other work, with current OPCM and standard validator calls to `gameType()` now primarily dealing with V1 contracts or feature toggle checks.

## NEW ISSUES

No new issues were opened today.

### Flaky Test Investigation
Discussion continued on [#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17966), "Flaky test: TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch". @geoknee requested links to failures from @mslipper, as they have been unable to reproduce the flaky test locally.
