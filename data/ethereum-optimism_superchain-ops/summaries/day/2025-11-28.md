### Custom Intent Deployment Reverts
Discussion on issue [#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18407) regarding `op deployer` reverting with custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` parameters concluded. The root cause was identified as a validation check requiring `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` to be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration`. The issue was resolved by overriding `PreimageOracleChallengePeriod` for testnet deployments.
