## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-node` Stability and Goroutine Issues
Discussions continued on [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16332) regarding `op-node` v1.13.3 experiencing thousands of stuck goroutines, primarily in `p2p.SyncClient` and `libp2p` after several hours of uptime, leading to sync failures. A user reported experiencing the same issue on v1.13.3.

### `op-supervisor` Event Overflow
Comments on [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16335) focused on the `op-supervisor` crashing due to event overflow when the unsafe head gap is too large. Discussions revolved around identifying the culprit event type, with `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` initially suspected but later clarified as unlikely to stack up. A PR ([#16473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16473)) was added to introduce a gauge for in-flight events to aid future debugging, and another ([#16471](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16471)) to add a counter per event type.

### Release Pipeline Automation
Issue [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16097) saw further discussion on using GoReleaser for `op-node`/`batcher`/`proposer`/`challenger` release pipelines. A lighter-weight solution for changelog generation using `git-cliff` was documented, with a focus on automating release notes. The broader goal is a one-click solution for consistent, high-quality changelogs.

### Interop Configuration Validation
Discussion on [#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15765) centered on the difficulty of validating `CrossL2Inbox` configuration in the EL prestate from the execution client's perspective. It was argued that the genesis generation tooling (`op-deployer`) already handles this correctly, making client-side validation less critical and potentially overly complex.

### Devnet Testing and L1 Faucet Support
On [#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/398), progress was noted on getting acceptance tests running in persistent devnets. A PR ([#16423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16423)) was added to support L1 Faucet functionality.

### Super DA Error Codes
Issue [#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/725) was opened to address missing error codes for data availability errors caused by reorgs in the Go implementation, which are currently absent from the spec.

### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet
Discussion on [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/399) clarified that Supersim is a lighter-weight local development tool built around Anvil, primarily for testing multichain/interop applications and upcoming features, while Kurtosis is used for chain testing within the OP Stack.
