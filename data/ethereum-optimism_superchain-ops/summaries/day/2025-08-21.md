## CLOSED ISSUES
### Proofs System Acceptance Testing
The umbrella issue for proofs interop acceptance testing, [#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15946), was closed as all sub-issues are complete. This includes the closure of [#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15948), which focused on `op-challenger` acceptance tests for interop chains, asserting its functionality in disputing invalid proposals.

### Event System Refinement
Two events were removed from the event system, leading to the closure of issue [#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17001).

### Test Target Setup
Issue [#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/375), concerning the incorporation of test target setup/teardown as an `op-acceptor` concern, was closed as Kurtosis is no longer considered important for network testing compared to Sysgo.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Contract Verification Improvements
Issue [#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/14813) saw recent discussion regarding contract verification improvements. The latest comment suggests revisiting `op-deployer` contract verification once Forge binary support is implemented, aiming to leverage `forge verify-contract` and reduce custom verification code. Previous discussions also considered using Sourcify for verification.
