# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Sep 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a critical bug fix for Tenderly link generation in nested safes and significant progress in closing out several flashblocks-related issues and proof system smoke tests.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Tenderly Link Generation Fix
*   A bug was fixed in Tenderly link generation to correctly support doubly nested safes, ensuring accurate state overrides and simulation links for complex multisig tasks ([#1197](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1197)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Monitoring
*   Flashblocks were successfully enabled on `prod-mainnet-op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-0` ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16759)) and the remaining sequencers on OP Labs infra ([#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16760), [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17317)), with stability confirmed.
*   Alerting for low peer count health of flashblocks-enabled sequencers was addressed ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16868)).
*   An issue regarding alerts for unhealthy non-flashblocks enabled sequencers was closed, as existing alerts already cover this scenario ([#17143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17143)).

### Proof System Smoke Tests
*   Several smoke test issues for `op-challenger` ([#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/141)), general proofs ([#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/140)), `op-dispute-mon` ([#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/142)), and `op-proposer` ([#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/143)) were closed as they are no longer required.

### Infrastructure and Tooling Updates
*   The deployment of `op-conductor` with EL p2p healthchecks was completed and confirmed to be working ([#17153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17153)).
*   An issue to upgrade `rbuilder` and `node-reth` for a chain stall fix was closed, as L2 was deemed safe from the issue ([#17328](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17328)).

### Documentation and Feature Decisions
*   A documentation suggestion to add an example for custom chains in the "Bridging ETH to OP Mainnet with Viem-Supported Networks" tutorial was updated and closed ([#1473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1473)).
*   The feature request for Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy was closed as it will not be implemented ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17194)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Contract Upgrade Testing
*   **[#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17332) Add soneium to contract upgrade tests**: A PR has been opened to address this issue, which aims to include `soneium` in the CI contract upgrade tests.

### OP-Program Enhancements
*   **[#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17416) op-program: Add hint for fast block header oracle lookup**: Discussions are ongoing regarding adding a hint to specs and `op-program` for faster block header oracle lookups. A draft PR has been created as a starting point for validation.
