# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on minor updates to RPC overrides and task execution statuses. Discussions continued on a critical `op-node` sequencer recovery mode bug, exploring potential fixes and underlying causes.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### RPC Configuration and Task Status Updates
A new RPC override environment variable was added, and the status of several U17 mainnet tasks was updated to "executed." This change primarily affects the `src/script` directory. ([#1307](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1307))

### Investigating `op-node` Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug
Discussions continued on a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recovery mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18350)). The core problem appears when a healthy sequencer, operating in recovery mode, requests an L1 origin block that doesn't yet exist, leading to "not found" errors and a stalled L1 origin advancement. This can violate the sequencer drift rule and cause derivation to stall if a bad batch is posted to L1. A possible fix snippet was proposed to prevent temporary errors when recovery mode reaches the chain tip. Further investigation is ongoing, particularly regarding the influence of asynchronous L1 origin fetching.
