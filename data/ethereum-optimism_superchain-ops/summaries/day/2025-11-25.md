# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on minor updates to RPC overrides and task execution statuses. Discussions continued on a critical `op-node` sequencer recovery mode bug, exploring potential fixes and underlying causes.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### RPC Configuration and Task Status Updates
A new environment variable for RPC overrides was added, and the execution status for several U17 mainnet tasks was updated. This change primarily affects the `src/script` directory. ([#1307](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1307))

### Investigating `op-node` Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug
Discussions continued on a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recovery mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18350)). The core issue appears to be that when the sequencer is in recovery mode, even if the chain is healthy, it may request an L1 origin block that doesn't yet exist, leading to "not found" errors. This prevents the L1 origin from advancing and can violate the sequencer drift rule, potentially stalling derivation if a bad batch is committed to L1. A possible fix snippet was proposed to prevent temporary errors when recovery mode catches up to the tip. Further investigation is ongoing, particularly regarding the influence of asynchronous L1 origin fetching.
