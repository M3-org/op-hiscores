# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Oct 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw new features added, including validation instructions for `op-txverify` and marking two tasks as executed. Discussions continued on an active issue regarding `op-dispute-mon`'s handling of out-of-sync nodes.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-txverify` Validation Instructions
New validation instructions were added for `op-txverify`, enhancing its usability and clarity. ([#1251](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1251))

### Task Execution Updates
Two Ethereum tasks, `028-arena-z-main-u13-to-u16a` and `029-swell-main-u13-to-u16a`, were marked as executed. ([#1250](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1250))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request was opened to fix a broken link to an Optimism blog article. ([#1249](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1249))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Proxy Stability
An issue concerning the loss of flashblocks when forwarding from `rollup-boost` to RPC nodes was identified and fixed, attributed to connectivity issues and subscriber pong timeouts in `flashblocks-websocket-proxy`. ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17856))

### Flashblocks RPC Provider Coordination
Coordination efforts with Flashblocks RPC providers regarding a new Flashblocks RPC node were completed, with most providers confirming their integration. ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17857))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-dispute-mon` Out-of-Sync Node Handling
Discussion continued on how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes when configured with multiple rollup RPCs. The core problem is that a behind node is incorrectly detected as a disagreement. A suggestion was made to use `syncStatus` to determine if a node is sufficiently in sync by checking if it has processed the L1 block where the dispute game was created. If a node is behind, its results should be ignored. It was noted that simply trusting the highest L2 block might be problematic if that node followed an incorrect fork. The issue was temporarily reopened after an accidental closure, pending the merge of a related PR. ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17814))
