## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kurtosis Devnet Prioritization Shift
Several issues related to the Kurtosis devnet, including adding genesis checks, improving idempotency/performance, extracting L1 chain config, creating proxyd tests, and adding a rotatory welcome message, were closed with the rationale that Kurtosis is no longer a primary focus. ([#15753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15753), [#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/14390), [#15050](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15050), [#15558](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15558), [#15511](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15511), [#15537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15537), [#16712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16712))

### Infrastructure Threat Modeling Review
An issue concerning infra threat modeling related to flashblocks delivery was closed after a discussion concluded that while improvements are needed for reliability and security, there's no novel risk beyond what's accepted for other images. The long-term solution involves provenance-based admission control. ([#17144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17144))

### Dispute Game Implementation Update
An issue to use v2 dispute game implementations in OPCM.addGameType was closed as a duplicate of another existing issue. ([#17259](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17259))

## NEW ISSUES

### Fast Block Header Oracle Lookup Hint
A new issue was opened to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookup within op-program specifications, aiming to provide key information for block hash lookups by number. ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17416))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis Reverse Proxy Websockets Support ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17194))
The issue, initially closed with the rationale of "Won't implement," was reopened due to a lingering TODO in the code referencing it. The latest comment requests the removal of this TODO if the feature is indeed not planned for implementation, as part of a backlog grooming effort.
