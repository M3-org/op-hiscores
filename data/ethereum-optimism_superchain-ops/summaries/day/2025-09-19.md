# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Sep 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant upgrades for several Sepolia chains, advancing them from U13 to U16 and U15 to U16a. A bug fix for Worldchain's nonce update and hash was also implemented, alongside a documentation update for `mise` activation instructions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Sepolia Chain Upgrades
Multiple Sepolia-based chains, including Zora, Metal, Mode, and Arena-Z, received significant upgrades. These tasks involved sequentially executing upgrades from U13 to U16, and U15 to U16a, enhancing their functionality and bringing them to newer versions.
- Zora Sepolia U13 to U16 ([#1180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1180))
- Metal Sepolia U13 to U16 ([#1181](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1181))
- Mode Sepolia U13 to U16 ([#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1182))
- Arena-Z Sepolia U15 to U16a ([#1194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1194))

### Worldchain Bug Fix and Documentation
A bug related to Worldchain's nonce update and hash was addressed, ensuring correct transaction processing. Additionally, documentation for `mise` activation instructions was updated for improved clarity.
- Worldchain Nonce Update and Hash Fix ([#1210](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1210))
- Mise Activate Instruction Documentation Update ([#1211](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1211))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Redundant Address Structs Consolidation
The issue concerning duplicated address structs across `op-deployer/op-chain-ops` and other packages was closed. The intended scope of consolidating these structs was completed.
- Create a single source of truth for addresses structs ([#14977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/14977))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Enshrine New Convention for Network Upgrade Transactions ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/781))
Discussion on this issue, opened today, focuses on establishing a new convention for Network Upgrade Transactions that deploy new contracts. Specifically, the conversation revolves around the `from` address choice and its impact on deployment. @protolambda provided a detailed note on address collision resistance for the proposed convention, comparing `CREATE`, `CREATE2`, and upgrade source-hash computations. They highlighted that the start of the `keccak` preimage always differs, preventing collisions. As an extra safety measure, @protolambda suggested using the `CREATE2` computation with a system address as the deployer and the source-hash as the salt, to fit within existing address computation frameworks and prevent future unexpected collisions.
