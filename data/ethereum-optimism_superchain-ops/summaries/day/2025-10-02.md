# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Oct 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the team focused on closing out several long-standing issues, including the Isthmus upgrade tracker and an acceptance test reporting enhancement. Discussions continued on Go 1.25 compatibility for Cannon and the integration of op-reth into the devstack.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Isthmus Upgrade Finalized
The tracking issue for the Isthmus upgrade has been closed, indicating its completion. A comment confirmed that "Isthmus is done" ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/12703)).

### L2EL Sync Condition Clarified
An issue investigating the conditions for L2EL to start syncing was closed. The resolution suggests that focusing on EL Syncs after the initial run, handled by `engineController.insertUnsafePayload`, addresses the concern ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17628)).

### Acceptance Test Reporting Improved
An issue aimed at including setup information in the HTML output of `op-acceptor` was closed, with a reference to a pull request in the `infra` repository that implemented the change ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/386)).

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility
Discussions continued regarding Cannon's compatibility with Go 1.25. It was confirmed that the issue affects the project, specifically causing incorrect Keccak hashes when running Cannon with Go 1.25. The underlying problem is linked to a Go issue, and while Go 1.25.1 has been released, it does not appear to include the necessary MIPS fix ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17060)).

### op-reth Integration for Jovian kt-devnet
The issue tracking the re-addition of `op-reth` to the Jovian kt-devnet is being re-evaluated. Given that Kurtosis devnet is deprecated, the focus has shifted to ensuring `op-reth` is integrated into the `devstack` or `sysgo` system instead ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17475)).
