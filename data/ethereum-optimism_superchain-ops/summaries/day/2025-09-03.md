# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Sep 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a critical bug fix related to the Go version update for `mise`, ensuring compatibility for `eip712sign`. Several new pull requests were opened, primarily for Superchain network upgrades. Active discussions continued on various issues, including CI improvements, Cannon/Kona integration, and P2P gossip configuration.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Go Version Compatibility
A bug fix was implemented to update the Go version used by `mise` from `1.22.7` to `1.24.6`. This change addresses a warning encountered when running `just install-eip712sign`, ensuring that `github.com/base/eip712sign@v0.0.11` can properly function as it requires Go version `1.23.0` or higher. ([#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1183))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Four new pull requests were opened today:
- [#1180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1180) proposes an upgrade for Zora Sepolia from U13 to U16.
- [#1181](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1181) suggests an upgrade for Metal Sepolia from U13 to U16.
- [#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1182) aims to upgrade Mode Sepolia from U13 to U16.
- [#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1184) addresses a fix for CI alerts related to forge tests.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI/CD and Developer Experience Improvements
Discussions on [#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17184) focused on improving the user experience and testability of the CircleCI configuration. Key pain points include the difficulty of local testing and the daunting size of the monorepo's CircleCI config. Suggestions include enabling local execution of high-value CI jobs like `kurtosis` and `go-tests-short`, addressing the manual setup required for local testing, and potentially automating the validation of `config.yml` syntax. There was also an interesting idea about dynamically sorting Go tests by execution time to optimize test job durations and allow developers to run more tests within their time budget.

### Kona + Cannon Integration
Issue [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17285) is tracking the necessary changes in OPCM to support Kona + Cannon. The latest comment confirms that OPCM will need to support deploying the new game type, specifically updating a conditional block in `OPContractsManager.sol`.
Relatedly, [#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17283) discusses integrating Cannon + Kona into the tooling for managing absolute prestates. The proposed solution involves adding a new `type = "cannon-kona"` field to `standard-prestates.toml` with a corresponding hash.

### P2P Gossip Configuration Bug
Issue [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17308) highlights a bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane default values with zero values, leading to panics in certain tests due to invalid configurations (e.g., `Dhi=0` and `Dscore=4`). The discussion revolves around whether to allow invalid configurations to work or to enforce valid configurations through a `DefaultP2PConfig` method that returns sensible defaults. The reporter provided a PR to address the issue by ensuring that zero values do not clobber valid defaults.

### Sync Test Enhancements
Issue [#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16703) was reopened as not all Hardfork transitions were tested. The discussion outlines ideas for future test cases, including checking all OP Stack Hardfork transitions, supporting multiple CLs with a single Sync Tester, and incorporating user transactions into L2 blocks for sync validation.

### Min-Base-Fee and Jovian Specs
Issue [#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/650) is tracking the addition of an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3`. The latest comment points to the Jovian specs for reference.

### Script Permissionless Devnet Spinup
Issue [#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/346) is being considered for closure, suggesting that the goal of improving the devnet spinup runbook with a runnable shell script might be complete or no longer a priority.
