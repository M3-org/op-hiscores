# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Sep 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the Superchain Ops team focused on expanding functionality with a new owner swap template and performing multiple network upgrades to U16a. Several long-standing issues related to architecture changes and CI stability were also closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Network Upgrades
Multiple Superchain networks, including Metal, Mode, Zora, Arena-Z, and Swell, were upgraded to U16a. These upgrades involved sequentially executing U13, U14, and U15 tasks, ensuring a smooth transition for these chains. Additionally, U16a mainnet tasks for OP/Ink/Soneium and Unichain were set to "ready to sign," and the Unichain U16a SEP was marked as executed.

### New Owner Swap Template
A new feature was added to allow swapping owner X to owner Y on a given Safe, enhancing the flexibility and security of Safe management. This template is crucial for security council operations that periodically swap owners.
([#1219](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1219))

### Documentation Improvements
Minor documentation fixes were implemented for Base U16a, improving clarity and accuracy for validation processes.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Streamlining Task Management and Architecture
Several issues related to the previous architecture and task management systems were closed. This includes making `SignFromJson` compatible with Safe Web UI ([#49](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/49)), cleaning up JSON length parsing ([#12](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/12)), and improving proposal operations ([#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/140)). The `VerificationBase` was merged into `JsonTxBuilderBase` ([#427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/427)), and a task tracking configuration was implemented ([#433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/433)).

### Enhancing Developer Experience and Tooling
Improvements to developer experience were addressed by closing issues such as making task invocation easier ([#593](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/593)), updating README installation instructions ([#617](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/617)), and creating a skeleton config test task ([#697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/697)). The `AccountAccessParser` was refactored ([#666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/666)), and the `signFromChildMultisig` function was refactored to reduce noisy terminal output ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/781)).

### CI Stability and Testing Improvements
Issues impacting CI stability and testing were resolved, including `mise deps` rate limit errors ([#569](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/569), [#628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/628)), and test failures with the latest Foundry version ([#577](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/577)). Issues related to the `sim-seq` feature, such as killing anvil after simulation ([#646](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/646)) and supporting Chain Governor 3/3 ([#647](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/647)), were closed as `sim-seq` is no longer in use.

### Security and Template Enhancements
The issue of reimplementing security council rehearsals using the new superchain-ops format was closed ([#529](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/529)). The creation of a "Swap Owner Template" was completed ([#1167](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1167)), and additional safety checks for finance templates were deprioritized and closed ([#778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/778)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Superchain-Ops Flow Improvements
A new issue was opened to report snags and suggest improvements for the superchain-ops flow, particularly during the signing process. Key points include confusion around `TODOs` in simulation output, the experimental nature of audit reports, the necessity of `op-txverify`, and the lack of explanation for "normalized state diff hash."
([#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1224))

### Testing and Helper Function Refinements
New issues were created to refine testing practices and helper functions. These include splitting assertions in tests for better granularity ([#17598](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17598)), adding an `_authorizeMinter(_minter)` helper function ([#17600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17600)), and considering explicit custom error cases ([#17601](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17601)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Superchain-Ops Flow Snags
The issue [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1224) highlights several pain points in the superchain-ops signing flow. @geoknee reported confusion regarding `TODOs` in simulation output, the experimental nature of audit reports, the requirement for `op-txverify`, and the lack of explanation for "normalized state diff hash." @blmalone responded by clarifying that `TODOs` are intended for task developers during simulation, not signers, and that audit reports were experimental. A PR was opened to address some of these snags, including changing language around audit reports and adding a missing `VALIDATION.md` section. @geoknee questioned the assumption that signers don't simulate, suggesting that `TODOs` still impact signer UX.

### Skeleton Upgrade Test Task
Issue [#698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/698) remains open, with @blmalone requesting @alcueca to provide more detail on the task. The issue aims to create a skeleton for upgrade test tasks, which is crucial for standardizing and streamlining the testing process for future upgrades.
