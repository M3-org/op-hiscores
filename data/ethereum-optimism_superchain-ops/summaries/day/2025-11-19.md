# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on improving testing infrastructure with a new integration test, updating development environment tools, and preparing for a Superchain upgrade. An issue related to `min-base-fee` simulations was closed, and documentation for `cannonKonaPrestate` requirements was discussed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Testing Enhancements
A new integration test was added to improve coverage for the `RevShareContractsUpgraderIntegration.t.sol` file, ensuring better reliability for contract upgrades ([#1302](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1302)).

### Development Environment and Scripting
The `mise.toml` configuration was updated to include `jq` with a specific version, resolving issues with script execution due to `jq` command compatibility ([#1300](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1300)). Additionally, a README for the U17 Sep Uni execution was added ([#1303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1303)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, "Worldchain key handover" ([#1304](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1304)), was opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Min-Base-Fee Simulation
The issue concerning simulations for the `min-base-fee` feature was closed ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16958)). The current approach is to observe the feature's performance in production.
