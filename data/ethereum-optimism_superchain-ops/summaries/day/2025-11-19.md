# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on improving integration tests for fee splitting contracts, updating development environment tools, and documenting upcoming upgrade execution. A new pull request for Worldchain key handover was opened.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Testing and Integration Improvements
A new integration test was added to improve coverage for the `IFeeSplitter.sol` contract, enhancing the robustness of revenue sharing mechanisms. ([#1302](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1302))

### Developer Tooling Updates
The `mise.toml` configuration was updated to include `jq` with a specific version, resolving issues with `just check-superchain-registry-latest` due to `jq` command compatibility. ([#1300](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1300))

### Upgrade Documentation
Documentation for the U17 Sepolia Uni execution was added, providing details for an upcoming upgrade. ([#1303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1303))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#1304](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1304), was opened concerning the Worldchain key handover.

## CLOSED ISSUES

## NEW ISSUES
### op-program Compatibility Fix
A new issue, [#18334](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18334), was opened to address a `vm-compat` program failure when analyzing `go1.25` binaries, specifically related to handling register modifications in r-type instructions.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `min-base-fee` Simulation and Production Monitoring
The discussion around issue [#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16958) regarding `min-base-fee` simulations concluded with the decision to observe the feature's performance in production rather than conducting further simulations.

### Documenting `cannonKonaPrestate` Requirement
Issue [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18095) highlights the need to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for standard chain upgrades. The latest update indicates that the docs team has received a one-pager, including this requirement, and there's an ongoing effort to integrate this into the official Optimism documentation, especially in light of the U18 upgrade.

### `op-program` `vm-compat` Fix for `go1.25`
Issue [#18334](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18334) addresses a critical bug where the `vm-compat` program fails to analyze `go1.25` binaries. A potential hacky fix involving modifications to `mips_parser.go` and `main.go` was suggested, indicating an active investigation into resolving this compatibility issue.
