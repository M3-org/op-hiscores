## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Security Council Rehearsal Preparation
- Created the "Rehearsal 1 - Welcome" playbook for Cohort B 2025 signers, including new READMEs and images for simulation success and state diffs. ([#1140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1140))
- Added new rehearsal materials for "rehearsal-2-remove-signer" and "rehearsal-3-nested-upgrade," including environment files, READMEs, and images. ([#1140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1140))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fault Proof Runbook Finalization
- The "Runbook v3 final review" issue was closed after a final review and updates to references from other runbooks. The runbooks were renamed to indicate applicable upgrade versions (v1 = pre-OPCM; v2 = U14 & U15; v3 = U16+), with cross-linking between versions. ([#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16651))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Configurable DA type for interop SuperSystem
- The issue was incorrectly closed due to automation and has been reopened. ([#15406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15406))
- Previous discussions indicated that while this is needed before removing pre-interop fault dispute code, it doesn't block interop shipping or RC beta.
- There's a recommendation against using `SuperSystem` or `interopgen` in favor of `op-devstack` for better configuration.
