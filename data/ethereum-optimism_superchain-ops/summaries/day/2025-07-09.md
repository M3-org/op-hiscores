# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Jul 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on refining core functionalities and addressing operational issues. Key activities included refactoring Gnosis Safe transaction encoding logic, fixing template renaming, and executing several Sepolia runbooks. Multiple issues related to testing reliability, op-node functionality, and CPU usage were also closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Gnosis Safe Logic Refactoring
Significant refactoring was performed to improve the organization and reusability of Gnosis Safe transaction encoding logic. Functions previously located in `MultisigTask` were moved to the `GnosisSafeHashes` library, enhancing modularity and maintainability. ([#1092](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1092))

### Template and Runbook Updates
A fix was implemented to rename a template by removing its version, streamlining future template management. Additionally, the status of three U16 Sepolia runbooks was executed, indicating progress in operational deployments. ([#1120](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1120), [#1117](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1117))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#1118](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1118): This pull request aims to enforce users to add the `op-contract` version to the template name, likely to improve versioning and clarity for contract templates.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Testing and Reliability Improvements
Several issues related to testing and reliability were closed. This includes improving the reliability of acceptance tests, with a focus on making them consistently pass on the first attempt rather than requiring multiple runs ([#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16378)).

### Operational and Node Functionality
An issue concerning the `op-batcher SetMaxDASize` problem, which caused the batcher to shut down due to an unavailable or broken RPC method, was closed due to inactivity ([#15355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15355)). Another issue related to adding a mode to `op-node` to use pre-Interop logic in trivial-Interop cases was closed as it is no longer being prioritized ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16520)).

### Documentation and Review
A runbook for v3 final review was closed, indicating that the review process for the fault proof incident runbook has been completed and updated references to other runbooks have been made ([#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16651)).

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes
Discussion on [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15789) revolves around understanding and implementing OPCM changes for the Fault Proof creator contract. The latest comment outlines a detailed checklist of tasks, including moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, removing `anchorStateRegistry` from `StandardValidatorOverrides`, unskipping and updating tests in `DeployOPChain.t.sol`, reviewing comment responses, addressing TODO comments, rebasing updates from EVM safety, and fixing Go updates for integration tests.

### Abnormal CPU Usage with op-geth
Issue [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/613) addresses abnormal CPU usage with `op-geth`. The latest comment confirms that the performance issue was likely due to an index update, which took approximately 24 hours to complete on an Orange Pi 5 Plus. A `profile.pb.gz` file was attached to aid in debugging. Previous discussions highlighted that the high CPU usage might be temporary, related to log indexing rebuilds, and that the issue persists even after the index upgrade for some users.

### RV Audit - `TestCrossSafeUpdate` and Hazard Set Construction
Issue [#16548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16548) discusses a test case (`TestCrossSafeUpdate`) that might be testing impossible scenarios and the lack of a clear `invalid` signal during Hazard Set construction. The latest comment indicates that a pull request has been made to address this, awaiting review.
