## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-batcher` Max Frame Size in Generic Mode ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17796))
This issue, concerning the `op-batcher`'s max frame size in generic commitment mode for altDA, was closed today. The latest comment from `nuke-web3` at 2025-11-07T20:04:56Z suggests that the relevant specification document should be updated to reflect the implemented change, as the current spec might still contain a false statement regarding `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` for `commitment_type == 0`. This indicates a need for documentation synchronization following the code fix.
