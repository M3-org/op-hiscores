## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Jovian U17 Mainnet Upgrades
Multiple pull requests were merged to implement the Jovian U17 upgrade tasks for various mainnets. This includes configurations and validation steps for OP, Soneium, Ink ([#1268](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1268)), Unichain ([#1271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1271)), Arena-Z, Swell ([#1270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1270)), and Metal, Mode, Zora ([#1269](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1269)).

### CI/CD Optimization
To speed up the merging of pending pull requests, regression tests were temporarily removed from the CI configuration ([#1283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1283)). These tests are planned to be re-added after the current backlog is cleared.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flaky Test Resolution
The `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` flaky test has been resolved and is no longer appearing in the top flaky tests, leading to the closure of the associated issue ([#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17548)).

### AltDA Max Frame Size Bug Fix
A bug related to the `op-batcher` max frame size in generic commitment mode for altDA was addressed and fixed, resulting in the closure of issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17796).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-batcher [altda]: should not limit max frame size to max input size in generic mode ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17796))
This issue, now closed, discussed a bug where `op-batcher` was incorrectly limiting the max frame size to the max input size in generic commitment mode for altDA. The fix was implemented in a pull request ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074)). A recent comment from `nuke-web3` suggests that the Optimism specs should be updated to reflect this change, as the current spec still contains a statement that is now false regarding `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` for `commitment_type == 0`.
