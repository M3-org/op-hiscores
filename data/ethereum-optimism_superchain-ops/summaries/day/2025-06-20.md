# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Jun 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on preparing for the U16 mainnet tasks, including enabling and removing DPM, and upgrading OPCM for various chains. Discussions continued on automating release notes and the trivial interop mode for `op-node`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### U16 Mainnet Task Preparation
Significant work was done to prepare for the U16 mainnet tasks, involving the creation of new configuration files and documentation for enabling and removing the DPM (Deposit Proxy Manager) and upgrading the OPCM (Optimism Portal Contract Manager) for several chains including op-ink, soneium, uni, and base. This includes `.env`, `README.md`, `VALIDATION.md`, and `config.toml` files for each task. ([#1047](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1047))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Automating Release Pipelines and Release Notes
Discussion continued on the issue of using GoReleaser for `op-node`, `batcher`, `proposer`, and `challenger` release pipelines ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16097)). The latest comments from `geoknee` (Jun 20, 2025) emphasized the desire for a one-click solution to generate high-quality, consistent changelogs, potentially by integrating `git cliff` into `op-workbench` to automatically generate and push release notes to GitHub. This builds on earlier suggestions for a lighter-weight changelog generation using `git cliff` and a specific template.

### Trivial Interop Mode for op-node
The discussion around enabling a trivial interop mode for `op-node` without a supervisor ([#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16519)) saw a new comment from `Inphi` (Jun 20, 2025) questioning the rationale, specifically if it complicates the upgrade path for chains merging into an existing interop cluster. This highlights a concern about potential future complexities if chains are not already supervisor-driven.
