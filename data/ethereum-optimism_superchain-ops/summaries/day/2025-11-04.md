# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on preparing for the Jovian Upgrade (U17) on OP betanets and sepolia-dev-0, including a critical bug fix related to gas limits. Additionally, updates were made to the OPCMv500 template and RPC configurations. Discussions on active issues covered `proxyd` time travel, blob priority fee tracking, and `op-acceptance-tests`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Jovian Upgrade (U17) Preparations and Fixes
Significant work was done to prepare for the Jovian Upgrade (U17) on OP betanets and sepolia-dev-0. This included adding necessary tasks and configurations for the upgrade. A critical bug was addressed where `forge` was attempting to send transactions with gas limits exceeding the Osaka limit, despite successful execution in Tenderly. This fix ensures the U17 upgrade can proceed smoothly on betanets.

- [#1280](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1280)

### Template and RPC Configuration Updates
The OPCMv500 upgrade template was updated to improve address fetching and validation, moving away from hardcoded values. The RPC configuration for Sepolia was also changed from Tenderly to a public node due to reliability concerns.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `proxyd` Backwards Time Travel
Discussions on [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/501) focused on potential solutions for `proxyd` returning previous blocks when backends are out of sync. Ideas include a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, `proxyd` handling "block out of range" errors by falling back to other backends, and various sticky session approaches (IP-based or signature-based). Concerns were raised about the impact of "backwards time travel" on other RPC methods like `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory`.

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking
Issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18102) addresses the need for better blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr`. The current `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` RPC doesn't adequately account for blob transactions. A suggestion was made to have the starting priority fee for new transactions "decay" from the previous transaction to handle backlogs more effectively, though this is considered a less comprehensive solution than a dedicated blob priority fee tracker.

### `op-acceptance-tests` for Flashblocks/Rbuilders
Issue [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16450) highlights that `sysgo` in `op-acceptance-tests` currently lacks support for flashblocks/rbuiders, preventing related tests from being run with the `sysgo` orchestrator. The latest comment indicates a desire to implement this to validate changes related to `kona-node` and `rollup-boost`.
