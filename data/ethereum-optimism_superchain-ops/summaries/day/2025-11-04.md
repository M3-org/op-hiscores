# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical upgrades and infrastructure improvements. Key activities included deploying the U17 Jovian Upgrade to OP betanets and sepolia-dev-0, fixing a gas limit issue for U17 execution, and updating the OPCMv500 template for better address fetching and validation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Jovian Upgrade (U17) Deployment and Fixes
*   The U17 Jovian Upgrade was deployed to OP betanets and sepolia-dev-0, adding necessary tasks for these upgrades ([#1273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1273)).
*   A bug was fixed where the U17 transaction failed on betanets due to forge requesting a gas limit exceeding the Osaka limit, despite successful execution in Tenderly ([#1280](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1280)).

### OPCM Template and RPC Configuration Updates
*   The OPCMv500 Upgrade template was updated to utilize `validateWithOverrides` from `standardValidator` and to fetch all possible addresses dynamically, rather than hardcoding them ([#1282](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1282)).
*   The Sepolia RPC was changed from Tenderly to a public node due to reliability concerns ([#1281](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1281)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Proxyd "Backwards Time Travel" Issue ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/501))
Discussions today focused on potential solutions to Proxyd returning previous blocks as the `unsafe` block when backends are out of sync. Joshklop noted that "Backwards time travel" could affect `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory` in addition to `eth_call`. Yashvardhan-kukreja brainstormed several approaches:
1.  **"Multicall" strategy for `eth_call`**: Fan out requests to all backends and return success if at least one responds. Con: N-times `eth_call` requests.
2.  **Proxyd awareness of "block out of range"**: Silently fall back to other backends on error. Con: Slower response times in worst-case scenarios.
3.  **IP-based sticky sessions**: Maintain a time-bounded mapping between client IP and backend. Con: Implementation time, potential request skew for clients behind a single forward-proxy.
4.  **Sig-based Sticky sessions**: Proxyd returns a tamper-proof signature in the response, which the client forwards for subsequent requests. Con: Requires client-side changes and publicity.
Yashvardhan-kukreja suggested Approach 1 if `eth_call` traffic allows, otherwise Approach 2 for its ease of implementation and the rarity of the issue.

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking for op-batcher/txmgr ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18102))
Sebastianst responded to ajsutton's suggestion about decaying the starting priority fee from the previous transaction. He noted that while this could be a special case of a blob priority fee tracker, it would have the downside of the batcher starting fresh after a restart. A dedicated blob priority fee tracker would initialize at startup and provide a better estimate from the start, though it's a larger lift.

### Update `migrate` method ([#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17743))
Inphi clarified that this issue specifically tracks OPCM changes, with devstack changes being covered in a separate issue ([#17764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17764)). This suggests the issue might be nearing resolution or closure.

### op-acceptance-tests: sysgo to support flashblocks / rbuilders ([#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16450))
Teddyknox expressed interest in implementing this to validate changes related to kona-node and rollup-boost. The issue highlights that sysgo currently lacks awareness of flashblocks/rbuilders, preventing flashblock-related tests from running with the sysgo orchestrator.
