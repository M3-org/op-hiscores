# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Sep 22, 2025)

## OVERVIEW

Today's development focused on enhancing debugging capabilities for nonce errors, fixing state differences for Base U16a Sepolia, and improving documentation for wallet imports.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Debugging and Validation
A new feature was added to display the task configuration file in nonce error messages, significantly speeding up debugging in CI environments [#1215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1215). Additionally, state differences for Base U16a Sepolia were corrected, specifically addressing omitted `approveHash` diffs [#1212](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1212).

### Documentation and Configuration Updates
Documentation was improved to guide users on importing Keystore Cast Wallets using raw private keys [#1214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1214). Configuration for U16a Sepolia was also updated to reflect execution for Ink, Soneium, and OP [#1213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1213).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kurtosis Integration Deprecation
The issue regarding adding `op-test-sequencer` to the devnet environment and Kurtosis [#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15265) was closed. The decision was made to move away from Kurtosis, rendering the task obsolete.

### Blob Configuration Fix
An issue concerning `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` always using default configurations [#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/685) was closed. This was identified as an upstream bug in Go-Ethereum that has since been fixed, and will be resolved with the next upstream merge.
