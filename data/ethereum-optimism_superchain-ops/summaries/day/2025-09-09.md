## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Sequencer Management
Two issues related to flashblocks sequencer management in mainnet were closed. This included the creation of a new sequencer to ensure an odd number of voters in the Raft conductor set and the removal of `prod-mainnet-sequencer-0` as a voter, positioning it as a backup. ([#17318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17318), [#17319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17319))

### Sync Tester Milestones and CI Enhancements
Significant progress was made on the sync tester, with the first milestone for sync acceptance tests being completed. Additionally, an issue concerning the exposure of more networks within the CI box for the sync-tester was closed, enabling the sync tester to use real chain data. ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16703), [#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/454))

### Acceptance Tests in Persistent Devnets
An issue tracking the progress of getting all acceptance tests running and passing in persistent devnets was closed. While significant progress was made, some remaining failures on Eris will be addressed in new follow-up tickets. ([#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/398))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Monitoring and Alerting Improvements for Flashblocks ([#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16388))
The monitoring dashboard for flashblocks has been completed, and remaining alerting PRs have been raised. This indicates significant progress towards establishing robust observability and paging for flashblocks.

### Nightly CI Job for Syncing with Latest op-node ([#17253](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17253))
The mainnet sync testing is currently blocked by an infrastructure issue, which needs to be resolved before the nightly CI job can be fully enabled.
