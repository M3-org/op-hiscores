# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Jun 23, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing wallet support with Trezor integration, optimizing CI/CD pipelines by removing completed tasks and increasing timeout limits for long-running jobs, and initiating a spike to optimize memory consumption in the op-batcher.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Wallet Support and Interface Improvements
A new feature was added to support Trezor wallets, which involved a breaking change to the interface by replacing a boolean `ledger` argument with a string `wallet` argument. This enhancement aims to broaden the range of supported hardware wallets.

### CI/CD Pipeline Optimization
Improvements were made to the CI/CD pipeline by removing simulations for Mode and Metal, as these tasks have already been executed. Additionally, a fix was implemented to address timeouts in CircleCI by increasing the timeout duration for long-running jobs that do not produce terminal output.

## NEW ISSUES
### Op-Batcher Memory Optimization
A new spike was initiated to investigate and optimize the memory consumption of the `op-batcher`, particularly during periods of L1 congestion. The goal is to reduce data duplication and copying within the current implementation.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Refactoring Redundant Assertions in Contracts
Discussion continues on removing redundant assertions outside of the `StandardValidator` in the contracts package. The plan involves a two-phase approach: first, removing checks duplicated in `ChainAssertions.sol` from `Deploy*.s.sol` scripts, and second, moving checks from `ChainAssertions.sol` to the `StandardValidator`. A potential challenge is the codesize limit, which might necessitate moving some checks to a child contract.

### Op-Node Trivial-Interop Mode Without Supervisor
The discussion revolves around enabling the `op-node` to function without a supervisor in a "trivial" interop case (a dependency set of size 1). This aims to prevent churn for chain operators who only have a trivial dependency set, avoiding the immediate need to run a supervisor. The long-term goal is to develop a more robust `op-supervisor` and `op-node` implementation.

### Spike: Op-Batcher Memory Optimization
Initial analysis using `pprof` suggests that the compressor is the primary source of memory usage when the batcher experiences a backlog of channels. Proposed optimizations include making the shadow compressor use less memory by not using two underlying compressors and potentially discarding the compressor more eagerly after a channel is submitted. Detailed steps for reproducing and profiling the memory usage were provided.
