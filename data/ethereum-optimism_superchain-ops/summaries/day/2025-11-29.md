# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on documentation clarity, with a new pull request opened to improve instructions for two-step simulation and ongoing discussions around porting `SuperchainConfig` types.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#1311](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1311), was opened to clarify two-step simulation instructions, particularly for large calldata.

## CLOSED ISSUES

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Clarifying Two-Step Simulation Instructions**
  Discussion continued on [#789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/789) regarding updating `NESTED.md` and `SINGLE.md` to reflect changes in how Base prints simulation links. Himess noted the issue was opened in March but still warranted attention for clearer documentation. A new PR, [#1311](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1311), has been submitted to provide more detailed and explicit guidance, with Himess asking for a decision on whether to proceed with the PR or close the issue.

- **Porting `SuperchainConfig` Type**
  On [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/741), Himess provided an update on porting the `SuperchainConfig` type from `superchain-registry`. Documentation for the `SuperchainDefinition` type has been added to the specs, referencing the `superchain-registry` code. Himess inquired if this meets the requirements and offered to open a PR if the changes are satisfactory, also noting that the referenced PR (op-rs/kona#2562) did not seem directly related to this specific change.
