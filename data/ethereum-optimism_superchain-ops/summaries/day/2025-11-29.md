## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Clarifying Two-Step Simulation Instructions**
  Discussion continued on [#789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/789) regarding updating `NESTED.md` and `SINGLE.md` to reflect changes in how Base prints simulation links. A new pull request, [#1311](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1311), was submitted to provide more detailed and explicit guidance, with the option to close the issue if the PR addresses the concerns.

- **Porting SuperchainConfig Type**
  Progress was made on [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/741) concerning the porting of the `SuperchainConfig` type from `superchain-registry`. Documentation for the `SuperchainDefinition` type has been added to the specs, and a PR is pending confirmation of its alignment with the original request.
