## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-node Interop Logic
Discussion on [#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16520) revolved around adding a mode to `op-node` to use pre-Interop logic in trivial-Interop cases, allowing it to function without a supervisor. The latest comment from tynes on July 9, 2025, indicates that this issue will be closed as it is no longer a priority. Previously, tynes also inquired about the feasibility of running services within the same process, similar to `op-e2e` or `sysgo`.
