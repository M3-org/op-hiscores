# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Jul 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on refining multisig task functionality with improved printing and code clarity. Additionally, validation files were updated for consistency, and discussions continued on critical infrastructure issues like flashblocks and builder deployments.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Multisig Task Improvements
Significant refactoring was done to the `MultisigTask` contract, enhancing code organization and readability, particularly for safe transaction handling and printing functionality. A property within the `SafeData` struct was also renamed for better clarity.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Infrastructure Deployment Decisions
Discussions concluded regarding the necessity of NVMe node deployment for `op-rbuilders` and dedicated namespacing for rbuilders, with decisions made to skip NVMe for now and integrate flashblocks components into existing namespaces.

## NEW ISSUES

### Block Explorer Migration
A new issue was opened to track the migration from Etherscan to Blockscout for L2 block explorer needs for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia, requiring updates across the repository.
- [#1131](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1131)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblocks on Sunnyside Sequencers
The discussion around enabling flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers for OP Sepolia continues. It has been deprioritized in favor of stabilizing flashblocks on OP Labs Sepolia infrastructure first. The issue [#16685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16685) is considered a blocker.
- [#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16688)

### Txpool Invalid Interop Tx Inclusion
The investigation into why invalid interop execution message transactions are conditionally included in the txpool is ongoing. Despite extensive tracing and reproduction attempts, the exact cause remains elusive. A specific instance of flakiness in CI tests was highlighted, where an invalid transaction was included and stuck in the mempool.
