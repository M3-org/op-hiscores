# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Jun 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, significant code refactoring to improve maintainability, and ongoing discussions around performance and developer tooling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Bug Fixes for Operations and Tooling
Two critical bugs were addressed today. One fix resolved a nonce bump issue affecting Base L1PAO and Base Ops Safe transactions, ensuring correct transaction execution ([#1102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1102)). The second bug fix corrected how `approve` and `execute` commands in `justfiles` handle `signer_args`, resolving local execution and approval errors ([#1103](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1103)).

### Multisig Task Refactoring for Improved Maintainability
A substantial refactoring effort was completed to remove child state variables from `MultisigTask.sol`. This change streamlines the codebase by passing `allSafes`, `allCalldatas`, and `allOriginalNonces` directly through functions, enhancing code clarity and maintainability across numerous templates and test files ([#1085](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1085)).

### Maintenance and Documentation Updates
A maintenance task was completed to mark the `015-set-game-implementation-arena-z-swell` task as done, updating its README accordingly ([#1105](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1105)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Integration and Acceptance Testing
Several issues related to Flashblocks were closed today. This includes enabling Flashblocks on `eris-0` ([#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16468)) and completing acceptance tests for Flashblocks transactions, ensuring new RPC fields and streaming capabilities are validated ([#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/354)).

### Developer Experience and Tooling Enhancements
Improvements to developer tooling were finalized, including the ability to modify predeploys within Supersim to facilitate testing of future predeploy changes ([#393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/393)). Additionally, a broken link in the documentation for `L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol` was resolved ([#283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/283)).

### CI/CD and Scripting Improvements
The spike to explore CI SLAs was closed, with the decision not to implement them for now ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16437)). Improvements to the OPCM Migrate Script were also completed ([#16326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16326)).

## NEW ISSUES

### User Experience and Nonce Errors
A new issue was opened regarding nonce errors encountered when approving and executing transactions after a single approval, indicating a potential UX problem during multi-step transaction processes ([#1106](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1106)).

### Op-Batcher Performance and Observability
Two new issues were created to address the `op-batcher`. One focuses on optimizing memory consumption, particularly during L1 congestion, to reduce data duplication and copying ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16537)). The other aims to increase observability of `op-batcher` memory consumption through `pprof` integration in Kurtosis devnet and new CI tests ([#16572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16572)).

### Supersim Feature Request
A feature request was opened for Supersim to enable logging of user-specified contracts, which would allow users to specify contracts for which they want event logs ([#411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/411)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Withdrawal Pathways for Superchain Output Roots ([#821](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/821))
Discussion continues on updating Viem's withdrawal code to support the new output roots structure for Superchain after the interop hard fork. The latest comment confirms that testing against the upcoming devnet is needed, and an endpoint for testing is being sought.

### Netchef and Flashblock Websocket Configuration ([#15940](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15940))
This issue is focused on improving Netchef to automatically bootstrap `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` with correct configurations for HA conductors. Recent comments indicate associated PRs in `infrastructure-services` are progressing this work.

### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/399))
The discussion clarifies the distinction between Supersim and Interop Kurtosis devnet. Supersim is described as a lighter, Anvil-based wrapper primarily for testing multichain/interop applications and upcoming features, while Kurtosis is used by OP Stack for chain testing. The latest comment confirms Supersim's main use for testing dapps rather than chains.
