## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Rollout and Documentation
Flashblocks were successfully enabled live on op-mainnet, as confirmed by the status of multiple sequencers showing "enabled" for Flashblocks. This milestone was accompanied by the completion of on-call onboarding and revision for Flashblocks, including a dedicated session and documentation. A blog post detailing the Flashblocks deployment, learnings, and improvements for mainnet was also written and published. ([#16498](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16498), [#17142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17142), [#17664](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17664))

### EL Sync Correctness
An issue related to EL Sync Correctness in `op-node` and `op-sync-tester`, specifically concerning EngineController parallelism and EL Sync Tests, was closed. The fix involved applying proper locking, which was tested and merged. The team noted that race detector enablement might be beneficial for future implementations. ([#17564](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17564))

## NEW ISSUES

### Developer Tooling Improvements
A new issue, [#1236](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1236), was created to address the need for better `justfile` command input validation. The current system provides unhelpful error messages when users incorrectly use commands, hindering the developer experience.
