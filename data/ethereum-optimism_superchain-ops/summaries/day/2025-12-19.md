## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No completed work was reported for this day.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Three new pull requests were opened:
- [#1325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1325) introduces a post-task assertion for testing.
- [#1324](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1324) adds a new devnet task.
- [#1323](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1323) provides a fix by adding checks for all data to sign in validation.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking
Issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18102), concerning `op-batcher/txmgr: Blob priority fee tracking`, was closed. The discussion highlighted that the blob tip oracle is now deployed to production, and the current configuration is overpaying compared to the oracle's suggestion. The oracle is currently informational, but its use is being considered for future optimization.

### Op-node Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug
Issue [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18350), regarding a possible bug in op-node sequencer recovery mode, was closed. The issue involved a scenario where recover mode was enabled during normal operation, leading to logs indicating a temporary error when fetching the next L1 origin. A refactoring of the L1 origin code in `op-node` and a similar fix to avoid erroring when the L1 origin is up to tip were implemented. The issue may be reopened if the drift problem reoccurs.

## NEW ISSUES

### Artifact Extraction Bug
A new issue, [#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18663), was opened concerning an artifact extraction bug. The `ExtractFromFile()` function in `op-deployer/pkg/deployer/artifacts/embedded.go` expects an `out/` directory within the tarball, but the `mktar` tool packages artifacts with a `forge-artifacts/` prefix, and `downloadHTTP()` also uses `forge-artifacts/`. This discrepancy breaks self-hosted `.tzst` artifacts.
