# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Aug 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on preparing for future upgrades with the addition of a U13 to U16 template and example task. Two new pull requests were opened, one for a new L1PortalExecuteL2Call template and another for a monorepo commit bump. Discussions continued on active issues related to testing and documentation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Upgrade Template Development
A significant addition was made with the introduction of a template and example task for upgrading from U13 directly to U16. This template is designed to streamline the upgrade process for chains on U12, allowing them to bypass intermediate phases and move directly to the latest upgrade level. This work involved adding several new files related to upgrade prestate and various upgrade versions. ([#1144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1144))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened:
*   [#1173](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1173) feat: add L1PortalExecuteL2Call template for L2 actions through OptimismPortal - This PR introduces a new template to facilitate L2 actions via the OptimismPortal.
*   [#1174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1174) Bump monorepo commit - This PR is for updating the monorepo commit.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed on Aug 28, 2025.

## NEW ISSUES
### CI/CD Improvements
A new issue was opened to discuss running the monorepo CI suite on `op-geth` PRs. The goal is to ensure that changes to `op-geth` are tested against the monorepo's end-to-end tests before merging, preventing potential regressions. ([#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/665))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Testing Infrastructure
Discussion continued on [#17248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17248) regarding enabling flashblock tests against persistent devnets. The latest comment from Stevmark11 reiterated the need to ensure these tests work correctly, noting that the necessary gate is already in place.

### Documentation Enhancements
The issue [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1530), concerning an example for creating an OP Stack Rollup testnet with `op-deployer`, saw new activity. krofax commented, mentioning a "rich PR" ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705/](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705/)) that overhauls the existing documentation and requested a review. Earlier comments from Chomtana highlighted the current confusion in the documentation due to a mix of old manual deployment methods and the new `op-deployer` approach, making it difficult for external chain operators. Visheshgpt also noted a high number of RPC calls on Alchemy when using the permissioned fault-proof system, primarily from the challenger.
