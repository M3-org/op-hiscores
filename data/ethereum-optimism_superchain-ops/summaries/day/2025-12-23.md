# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Dec 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on preparing for the U18 upgrade on OP betanets by adding necessary tasks and fixing an inaccuracy in the L2 simulation documentation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Betanet U18 Upgrade Preparations
Significant work was done to add tasks required for the upcoming U18 upgrade on OP betanets. This includes adding game type 0, setting the respected game type to 0, and upgrading the `superchainConfig` to v600. This work lays the groundwork for the U18 upgrade, though the actual upgrade task is not yet included in these changes. ([#1319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1319))

### L2 Simulation Documentation Fix
A bug in the `simulate-l2-ownership-transfer.md` how-to guide was addressed. The documentation incorrectly stated that the "From" address in the L2 simulation should be the L2 transaction parameter, rather than the aliased caller from L1. This fix improves the accuracy of the L2 simulation guide. ([#1291](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1291))
