## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Three new pull requests were opened today, all proposing new features:
- A feature to revert if a task's required gas limit is too close to the Fusaka transaction gas cap has been proposed ([#1277](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1277)).
- A pull request to add a permissionless game type for Soneium Mainnet has been opened ([#1276](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1276)).
- Another feature for Soneium Mainnet to set a respected game type has been submitted ([#1278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1278)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Transaction Gas Limit Issues** ([#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17912)): Discussion continues regarding the "transaction gas limit too high" error when deploying contracts with `op-deployer:v0.2.6`. The latest comment confirms that the Fusaka hardfork (EIP-7825) enforces a transaction gas limit cap of 16,777,216, causing the network to reject large transactions. It was suggested that transactions need to be broken down or optimized. The commenter also noted that `op-deployer:v0.5.0` is the latest version, though it's still a release candidate and its behavior post-Fusaka is untested.
- **L1 Chain Config for L3s** ([#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18070)): The discussion revolves around the necessity of providing `op-node` and `op-program` with L1 chain configuration for L3s. The latest comment agrees that the system should automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID and apply L3 behavior, similar to how L1 Mainnet and Sepolia are recognized, to simplify the process for most L3s.
- **Running Acceptance Tests Without Monorepo** ([#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/469)): The ongoing challenge of running acceptance tests outside the monorepo was highlighted. A new comment added that modifying devnets with options often doesn't work because orchestrator fields are private, further complicating external testing.
