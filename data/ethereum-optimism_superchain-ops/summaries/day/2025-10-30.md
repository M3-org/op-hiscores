## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Transaction Gas Limit Issues with `op-deployer`** ([#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17912)): The discussion confirmed that the "transaction gas limit too high" error is due to the Fusaka hardfork's enforcement of a 16,777,216 transaction gas limit cap (EIP-7825). It was suggested that large transactions need to be broken down or optimized. The issue also noted that the `op-deployer` version used is older, and a newer release candidate (v0.5.0*) should be considered, though its post-Fusaka compatibility is yet to be tested.
- **L1 Chain Config for L3s in `op-node` and `op-program`** ([#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18070)): The discussion centered on automatically detecting known L2 chain IDs as "L1" for L3s, similar to how Mainnet and Sepolia are recognized. This would simplify configuration for most L3s.
- **Improving Acceptance Test Execution** ([#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/469)): A new comment highlighted that modifying devnets with options often fails because orchestrator fields are private, adding to the challenges of running acceptance tests outside the monorepo.
