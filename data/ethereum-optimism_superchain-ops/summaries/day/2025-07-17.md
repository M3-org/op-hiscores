## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Security Council Rehearsal Enhancements
Updates were made to the Security Council Rehearsals, specifically for removing signers and implementing nested upgrades. This involved removing old templating for signer removal and introducing a new GnosisSafe signer removal template within the superchain-ops improvements system. Additionally, deployment scripts for nested rehearsals were refactored, and comprehensive documentation was added for the third security council rehearsal step.
