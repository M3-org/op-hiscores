# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Aug 1, 2025)

## OVERVIEW

The day's development focused on a significant feature addition: supporting multi-level nesting for Gnosis Safe signing, enhancing the flexibility and depth of secure operations within the Superchain.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Gnosis Safe Signing Capabilities

A major feature was introduced to enable multi-level nesting for Gnosis Safe signing ([#1150](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1150)). This allows for signing with Gnosis Safes at arbitrary depths, moving beyond the previous limitation of a single level. This improvement is crucial for op-stack chains requiring more complex and secure transaction signing workflows.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

### Tracking Min Base Fee Implementation

Discussions continued on [#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16807), which tracks the implementation of the minimum base fee. The latest comment from wlawt at 2025-08-01T15:46:47Z shared an early reth draft ([https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/17704](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/17704)) to gather early feedback and decisions.

### Min Base Fee Specification

Issue [#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/742), concerning the specification for the minimum base fee, saw a new comment from geoknee at 2025-08-01T21:26:38Z. The comment highlighted the need to compute a rough estimate for the state growth implied by this feature, suggesting its inclusion in the motivation section of the specifications.
