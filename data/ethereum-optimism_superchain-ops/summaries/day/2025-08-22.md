### Validation Testing Enhancements
Discussion on issue [#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/686) continues, focusing on improving validation testing to prevent bugs similar to #685. The latest comment from alfonso-op on August 22, 2025, suggests a follow-up discussion with @bitwiseguy and Tess to review "not planned" validation tests for potential implementation. Previous discussions highlighted the need to refactor tests, move complexity into pure functions for better testability, and increase code coverage, especially for parsing standard TOML files which are prone to errors.
