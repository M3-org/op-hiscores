# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Aug 26, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on improving the reliability of simulation scripts by adding fork retries, reducing CI flakiness. Discussions continued on active issues related to `op-proposer` failures, sync testing, and flashblocks monitoring.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Simulation Script Reliability**
    *   Added fork retries to simulation scripts to reduce CI flakiness ([#1172](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1172)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **`op-proposer` Transaction Failures**
    *   A user confirmed that setting `--game-type=1` fixed their `op-proposer` transaction creation failure, aligning with previous suggestions about misconfigured game types or contracts ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/13502)).

*   **Sync Acceptance Tests**
    *   The issue was reopened as not all Hardfork (HF) transitions were tested. New test case ideas include checking every OP Stack HF transition, validating multiple CLs syncing with individual mock EL endpoints, and testing user transactions within L2 blocks ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16703)).

*   **Flashblocks Load Testing**
    *   A request was made for a summary document detailing the load test scenarios, networks used, and results for flashblocks on `eris-0` ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16756)).

*   **Flashblocks Sequencer Alerts**
    *   An alert is planned for when a non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer becomes active or flashblocks are turned off, indicating a potential issue with flashblocks. This alert will be created once a related pull request is merged ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16867)).
    *   Regarding low peer count alerts for flashblocks-enabled sequencers, it was noted that peer count alerting for `op-node` sequencer peering already exists. The focus will be on adding `reth`/`op-rbuilder` peer count alerts for this specific issue ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16868)).
