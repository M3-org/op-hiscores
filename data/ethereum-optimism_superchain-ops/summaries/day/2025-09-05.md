# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Sep 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on addressing a flaky test in the regression suite by manually passing gas to prevent out-of-gas errors. Several issues related to `min-base-fee` implementation and `op-nat` integration were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Test Stability Improvements
A fix was implemented to address a flaky regression test that occasionally failed due to out-of-gas errors. Gas is now manually passed to this specific test to ensure its stability and reliability [#1186](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1186).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
None

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Min-Base-Fee Feature Implementation
Several issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature were closed, indicating progress in its implementation. This includes adding `minBaseFee` to the block header's `extraData` field [#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/649), adding an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3` [#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/650), and updating `eip1559.CalcBaseFee` to enforce the minimum if the feature is active [#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/651). All these issues were closed via the same `op-geth` pull request.

### `op-nat` Integration Deprioritized
The issue concerning running `op-nat` in Kurtosis [#158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/158) was closed. This decision was made due to a shift in priority towards other local development environment initiatives.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Large Genesis File Handling in `op-geth`
Discussion on issue [#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/668) regarding `op-geth` initialization with a large 7GB genesis file and a LevelDB panic continued. The latest comment from @protolambda suggests that the Genesis-State-Spec (the "alloc" part of `genesis.json`) is optional and doesn't need to be stored in `geth`. It's recommended to modify `op-geth` for a one-time state import by not storing the alloc data as a flat JSON blob and instead importing the state into the DB. Additionally, including the `stateHash` attribute of the genesis block in the chain-`config` part of `genesis.json` would allow new nodes to start with an empty DB and snap-sync state from other bootstrap nodes. This approach aligns with how `op-mainnet` operates, avoiding excessively large `op-geth` binaries.

### Superchain Configuration Explicitness
Issue [#763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/763) discusses making chain configurations fully explicit. The latest comment from @alfonso-op questions whether chain configs are already self-descriptive and if the issue can be closed, indicating a potential resolution or re-evaluation of the problem.
