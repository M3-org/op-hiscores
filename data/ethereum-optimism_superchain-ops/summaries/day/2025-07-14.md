No new issues to report for this date.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Sync Tester Development
Discussions on the `op-sync-tester` issue [#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16452) focused on session management and API design. @protolambda suggested using UUIDs in the URL for session identification via HTTP middleware, avoiding the need for a special `sync_init` RPC. @pcw109550 proposed a session management flow involving a `sync_init` RPC to return a session ID, which would then be used to register a new endpoint for stateful proxying of CL requests to EL.

### Interoperability Stress Testing
The issue concerning stress testing the interop expiry window [#15285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15285) saw clarification on the "consolidation step" from @pauldowman, explaining it as the final step in the fault proof program that validates executing messages. @mds1 sought this clarification. Earlier comments indicated that while microbenchmarks were done, an actual worst-case scenario test on interop-enabled chains is still desired.

### E2E Test Improvements
Discussions on the E2E invalid interop transaction reinjection test [#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16656) centered on how to best implement the test. @pcw109550 suggested using `op-test-sequencer` to force include invalid execution messages, then checking for reorgs and ensuring the invalid transaction is not present in the mempool. Reference was made to a PR that allows inspecting the mempool.

### Code Duplication in op-batcher
The issue regarding duplicate code in `op-batcher` [#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16677) received a comment from @geoknee thanking @chuwt for the observation and inviting a PR to fix it. @chuwt confirmed willingness to create a PR.

### Acceptance Test Porting
The issue to port `TestERC20Bridge` to devstack [#415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/415) was updated by @serpixel, noting that the porting has been completed and referencing the relevant pull request.
