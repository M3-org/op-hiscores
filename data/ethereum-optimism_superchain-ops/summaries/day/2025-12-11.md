# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Dec 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on expanding Soneium Minato Testnet capabilities by adding permissionless game types and updating their status, alongside addressing critical node synchronization issues reported by the community.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Soneium Minato Testnet Enhancements
Two new tasks were introduced to the Soneium Minato Testnet: adding a permissionless game type (0) and setting it as the respected game type. The status of the `addGameType` task was subsequently updated to "executed." ([#1317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1317), [#1320](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1320))

### Node Synchronization Problems on Optimism and Base Chains
An active issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18581) reports that nodes are not synchronizing, with errors like "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload." Users on Optimism, Base, and Unichain are experiencing this, particularly when using `op-geth` with snapshots from publicnode.com. The latest comments indicate that the issue might be related to the L1 Execution Client not providing necessary state data to the Op-Node. A request has been made for detailed client configurations, full logs, and startup flags to diagnose the problem. One user noted that `snapsync` with `--syncmode=execution-layer` worked for a new Unichain node, suggesting potential solutions.
