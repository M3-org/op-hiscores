## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
**Investigating and Improving CI Flakiness**
Discussions on [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16271) continued, with `scharissis` providing an update on June 13th, linking to related issues and a PR ([#16404](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16404), [#16411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/16411)). Previously, `scharissis` had identified the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests and noted that most flakiness was due to infrastructure issues rather than acceptance testing itself.

**Improving Reliability of Acceptance Tests**
On [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16378), `scharissis` shared a new "Flakiness Report" on June 13th, which includes job names to help identify the backend used and potential sources of flakiness. Earlier, `nonsense` noted that `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` and the `reorg` package passed with `-count=5`, and `pcw109550` highlighted that measuring flakiness by package rather than single tests might be more accurate due to shared environments. `teddyknox` agreed with this point.
