# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Jul 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day focused on critical bug fixes related to U16 Sepolia improvements, specifically addressing configuration and state override issues to ensure proper simulation and functionality of various upgrades and removals.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### U16 Sepolia Configuration and Validation Fixes
Multiple bug fixes were implemented to address issues within the U16 Sepolia improvement tasks. This included adding necessary fixes for DPM and DGM related tasks, and updating validation files.
- Add U16 Sepolia fixes ([#1113](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1113))

### Configuration File Bug Resolution
A significant bug in the `config.toml` files for U16 OPCM upgrades (v400-soneium and v400-uni) was resolved. This fix ensures that `isRc` and `superchainConfig` are properly set, leading to correct normalized hash generation.
- fix: 015-U16 config.toml bug fix ([#1114](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1114))

### Guardian Nonce Override for Simulation
A state override was added to the U16 guardian nonce, specifically for the `017-U16-remove-dgm` task. This ensures that the task can be simulated correctly in a standalone state.
- fix: 017-U16 guardian nonce override ([#1115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1115))

### Precompile Address Initialization
Discussion on issue [#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16620) clarified the purpose of initializing addresses 0x00-0xff with 1 wei balance in op-stack. The latest comment from tynes (Jul 8, 2025) explains that these are precompile addresses and the 1 wei balance is a standard practice due to "obscure rules in how empty accounts work," ensuring they are not treated as empty accounts.
