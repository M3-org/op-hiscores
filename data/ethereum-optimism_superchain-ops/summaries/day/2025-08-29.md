# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Aug 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw progress on documentation with a new pull request for liveness templates. A significant issue regarding the deprecation of the `req-resp` p2p sync in `op-node` received detailed discussion, highlighting alternative sync mechanisms. The `min-base-fee` specification issue was closed, indicating completion of its documentation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Protocol Specification & Documentation:** A draft for liveness templates was initiated to enhance operational documentation. The specification for `min-base-fee` was finalized and the corresponding issue closed, indicating completion of its formal documentation.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Deprecation of `req-resp` P2P Sync in `op-node`:** Issue [#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/14108) discusses the removal of the `req-resp` p2p sync protocol from `op-node` to address existing sync problems. The latest comment provides extensive context and alternative ideas from @emilianobonassi, who prototyped an alternate unsafe block sync mechanism. This alternative is described as cheaper, simpler, and faster for scale-out and recovery compared to `req-resp` due to its simpler networking (avoiding UDP and static IP limitations) and better handling of race conditions. The proposed alternative is complementary to p2p, allowing multiple "drivers" for block gossiping, including a centralized one where the sequencer leader publishes the latest unsafe block via Redis, and other nodes subscribe and inject it via the `admin_postUnsafePayload` API. On restarts, a sidecar checks sync status and fetches blocks from the EL.
