# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Jul 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day focused on critical bug fixes within the `superchain-ops` repository, specifically addressing issues related to OPCM task support for multiple targets and the use of historical prestates for speedrun templates.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### OPCM Task Base Improvements
Bug fixes were implemented to enhance the `OPCMTaskBase` to support multiple OPCM targets, which is crucial for enabling speedrun templates from U13 to U16. This involved modifications to several OPCM template files.
- [#1146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1146)

### Speedrun Prestate Management
A bug fix was introduced to utilize historical prestates for speedruns, preventing creation collision errors that arise from using a single prestate for each upgrade. This change impacts the `OPCMUpgradeV200toV400.sol` template and related test configurations.

### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerting Improvements
Issue [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16388) focuses on establishing monitoring and alerting for flashblocks, particularly as op-sepolia approaches flashblocks enablement. Recent discussions highlight key metrics and alerts needed:
- **Peer Count & SLAs:** Minimum peer count of 4, with SLAs around block progression and divergence.
- **Pending Transactions:** Alerts for spikes in pending transactions (e.g., beyond ~60), requiring verbose runbooks.
- **Flashblocks-related SLA:** A p99 metric over a time interval for `reth_op_rbuilder_total_block_built_duration`.
- **Flashblocks-websocket-proxy:** Monitoring for connection failures, errors, and the absence of metrics.
- **Flashblocks-RPC Node-Reth:** Alerts for upstream errors (count below a number) and upstream messages (rate below a number) indicating issues with listening to the websocket proxy.
- **op-node-rbuilder:** Inheriting most op-node alerts and metrics.
