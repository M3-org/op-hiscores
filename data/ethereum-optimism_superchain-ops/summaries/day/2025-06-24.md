# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Jun 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a significant revert of a previous feature, alongside active discussions on CI stability, developer experience, and documentation improvements. Several issues were closed, indicating progress in addressing long-standing concerns.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Feature Revert:** A feature related to Trezor support was reverted, impacting `nested.just`, `single.just`, `src/improvements/nested.just`, and `src/improvements/single.just` ([#1100](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1100)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Documentation Updates:** The issue regarding bridging ERC-20 tokens with Viem was closed, indicating that the documentation has been updated to address the concerns raised ([#1508](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1508)).
*   **Test Determinism:** A feature request to enable deterministic gas testing by setting a fixed base fee was closed, with the suggestion to adapt tests to query the `baseFee` instead ([#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/408)).
*   **CI SLA Exploration:** The spike to explore adopting internal SLAs for the continuous integration pipeline was closed, with the decision not to implement CI SLAs for now ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16437)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **CI Flakiness Investigation:** The issue concerning CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16271)) was closed today. The latest comment from scharissis at 2025-06-24T04:44:09Z indicates that a test flake report generator has been released and iterated upon, the report has been publicized, and test flakiness has improved. The team will continue to monitor flakiness.
*   **op-node Stuck Goroutines:** Discussions continue on the `op-node` v1.13.3 issue with thousands of stuck goroutines in `p2p.SyncClient / libp2p` ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16332)). The latest comments from rrrengineer at 2025-06-24T19:01:08Z and Creamers158 at 2025-06-17T10:52:35Z confirm that users are experiencing the same issue on `op-node` v1.13.3, with one user yet to try v1.13.4.
*   **CI SLAs Spike:** The spike to explore CI SLAs ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16437)) was closed today. The latest comments from scharissis at 2025-06-25T05:58:06Z confirm the decision not to implement CI SLAs for now. Prior to closure, pauldowman at 2025-06-24T15:23:35Z and teddyknox at 2025-06-24T14:33:24Z provided feedback, suggesting that PR merge time isn't a meaningful CI metric and proposing smarter ways to allow new tests into the repo to proactively detect flakiness. ajsutton at 2025-06-24T04:18:18Z expressed skepticism about the necessity of SLAs for developers and questioned specific metrics like the 5% failure rate and 1-hour PR feedback time, also advising against disabling breaking checks.
*   **Port TestWithdrawalsRoot to devstack:** The issue to port `TestWithdrawalsRoot` to devstack ([#412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/412)) was closed today. The latest comment from serpixel at 2025-06-24T17:53:45Z indicates that this has been implemented in [#16547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16547).
*   **Deterministic Gas Testing:** The feature request for deterministic gas testing ([#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/408)) was closed today. The latest comments from tremarkley at 2025-06-24T18:15:58Z and hexshire at 2025-06-24T18:03:50Z indicate a misunderstanding of the `--base-fee` functionality, with the suggestion to adapt tests to query the `baseFee` instead.
