# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the addition of a new "approved" status for CI fixes and significant progress in testing, particularly with the introduction of a template and integration tests for the `setupRevShare()` flow.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI Workflow Enhancements
A new "approved" status was introduced to improve CI workflow, specifically for scenarios where approvals are done but execution is pending, preventing the addition of a transaction hash. This helps in fixing CI issues more efficiently. ([#1310](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1310))

### RevShare Integration Testing
Extensive work was done to set up and test the `setupRevShare()` flow. This included introducing a new template for execution and adding integration tests to verify the state on L2, along with regression tests. ([#1305](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1305))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#1309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1309) test: update configs with soneium (#81) - This pull request focuses on updating configurations related to "soneium" within the test suite.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game Creator Pattern Refactor Audit
The audit for the Dispute Game Creator Pattern refactor ([#17069](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17069)) is currently in progress as part of a general U18 audit. The latest comment from pauldowman on November 27, 2025, confirms its ongoing status. Previously, on September 11, 2025, pauldowman requested @stevennevins to provide an overview and specific points for auditors in the security readiness document.

### op deployer with custom intent reverts
An issue ([#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18407)) was reported where the op deployer reverts when using custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values. The issue was closed on November 28, 2025, with InoMurko confirming that overriding `PreimageOracleChallengePeriod` resolved the signature error revert, noting this is for testnets. On November 27, 2025, ajsutton suggested that the revert was likely due to validation requiring `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` to be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration`, and advised caution against significantly reducing the preimage oracle challenge period in production.
