# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing CI processes with an "approved" status for pending transactions and significant progress in revshare integration testing, including new templates and regression tests.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI Workflow Improvements
A new "approved" status was added to the CI process to better handle scenarios where approvals are complete but execution is pending, preventing CI failures due to nonce changes without a transaction hash. ([#1310](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1310))

### RevShare Integration Testing
Extensive work was done to set up and test the `setupRevShare()` flow. This included introducing a new template for execution and adding integration and regression tests to verify the state on L2. ([#1305](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1305))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#1309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1309): This PR focuses on updating configurations related to "soneium" for testing purposes.
- [#1308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1308): This PR aims to address and fix informational findings from an audit.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Deployment Configuration Challenges
A new issue was opened regarding `op deployer` reverting when using custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values, suggesting a potential validation conflict. ([#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18407))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Audit for Dispute Game Creator Pattern Refactor ([#17069](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17069))
The audit for the Dispute Game Creator Pattern refactor is currently in progress as part of the general U18 audit. Previously, there was a request for more detailed information in the audit scope section of the security readiness document, including an overview and specific points for auditors to focus on.

### op deployer with custom intent (faultGameClockExtension, faultGameMaxClockDuration) reverts ([#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18407))
The issue describes `op deployer` reverting when custom values for `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` are used. Ajsutton commented that this is likely due to a validation check in `FaultDisputeGame.sol` which requires `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` to be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration`. The comment also advises against significantly reducing the preimage oracle challenge period or using a very short dispute game clock in production due to the time required for data and transaction execution.
