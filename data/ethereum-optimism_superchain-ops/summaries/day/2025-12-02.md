# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Dec 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on adding a new feature to handle Worldchain Sepolia key handback over tasks, indicating continued expansion and maintenance of the Superchain ecosystem.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Worldchain Sepolia Key Handback Over Task
A new feature was added to implement the Worldchain Sepolia key handback over task, involving the creation of new environment files, READMEs, validation documents, and configuration files for two separate task instances. This also included updates to the CircleCI configuration and a Solidity contract. ([#1284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1284))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node` Invalid Block Signature
A user reported encountering an "op-node invalid block signature unrecognized signer" error during testnet deployment ([#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17448)). Another user commented today, stating they have the same problem and are seeking a solution.

### Proxyd Backwards Time Travel
Discussion continued on the issue of Proxyd potentially "traveling back in time" when backends are out of sync, leading to incorrect block data for `unsafe` blocks ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/501)). Today, a developer confirmed plans to focus on this issue starting January 1st, during their next on-call rotation, and received an acknowledgment with no additional concerns from another team member. Previous discussions explored several potential solutions, including a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, Proxyd handling "block out of range" errors, and various sticky session approaches (IP-based or signature-based). The trade-offs of each approach, such as increased request forwarding, slower response times, or client-side changes, were also considered.
