# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Sep 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on preparing for the U16a upgrade, specifically for Optimism, Soneium, Ink, and Unichain. This included adding new tasks, updating their statuses, and refining templates for the OPCM v410 upgrade.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### U16a Upgrade Task Management
New tasks were added for the Sepolia U16a upgrade, specifically for Optimism, Soneium, Ink, and Unichain. These tasks involve the OPCM upgrade to v410, with Optimism, Soneium, and Ink sharing a common PAO, while Unichain has a separate one. The statuses of these tasks were subsequently updated to "ready to sign." ([#1198](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1198), [#1202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1202))

### Template and Version Updates
The U13 to U16 template and example tasks were updated to reflect U16a OPCM/Validator addresses. This also included updating all mentions of U16 to U16a and OPCM v400 to v410. ([#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1203))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flakiness in `TestPreNoInbox`
The issue [#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17298) regarding the flakiness of `TestPreNoInbox` in `op-acceptance-tests` continues to be active. A recent comment on September 17th indicates that a previous attempt to fix the issue ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17495](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17495)) was unsuccessful, following another reported flake on September 16th.

### Token Bridging Clarification
Issue [#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1203) seeks clarification on a token bridging problem related to PR #1184. A comment from September 16th suggests that the token in question on Base might not be an `OptimismMintableERC20`, which could explain why the generated entry lacks a bridge address. Verification of the implementation is recommended.

### `protocol/system-config.md` Cleanup
Discussion on issue [#771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/771) for cleaning up `protocol/system-config.md` continued with a suggestion on September 16th to specify both the number and canonical name for config update enums (e.g., `MIN_BASE_FEE` and `6`).
