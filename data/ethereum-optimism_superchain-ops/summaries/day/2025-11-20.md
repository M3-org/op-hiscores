## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#1305](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1305), was opened to set up revshare integration testing.

## CLOSED ISSUES
- **Batcher Throughput Runbook:** The issue [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16959) concerning a runbook for low batcher throughput related to `min-base-fee` was closed. A runbook has been created to address this.

## NEW ISSUES
- **AnchorStateRegistry Dependency:** A new issue, [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18347), was opened to discuss removing the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry`.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **AnchorStateRegistry Dependency Discussion:** In issue [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18347), the discussion revolves around the `AnchorStateRegistry`'s check that its `anchorStateRegistry()` matches the dispute game's. Inphi suggested expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface to require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method to maintain the sanity check. Ajsutton questioned the necessity of this sanity check, noting that deployment-time checks via `OPStandardValidator` already ensure the correct `ASR` is used, and that simply reporting the same `ASR` doesn't guarantee its actual use. However, ajsutton also acknowledged that the addition of `wasRespectedAtGameCreation` might make requiring the method less problematic.
