# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Jun 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, particularly addressing `sim-sequence` and Base Sepolia nonce issues. Significant progress was also made on preparing Mode and Metal Mainnet for permissioned fault proofs, alongside general Sepolia nonce updates.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Fault Proof System Preparations
Work continued on transitioning Mode and Metal Mainnet to use permissioned fault proofs. Initial files and tasks were added to facilitate this upgrade, laying the groundwork for enhanced security and decentralization within the Superchain. ([#955](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/955), [#956](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/956))

### Sepolia Nonce Management and Bug Fixes
Several updates were made to manage Sepolia nonces, including a specific fix for Base Sepolia's nonce after a recent transaction. A bug in the `sim-sequence` script was also addressed by introducing an environment flag to control override checks, improving the reliability of simulation processes. ([#1048](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1048), [#1061](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1061), [#1051](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1051))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Test Suite Refinement
The issue related to `op-acceptance-tests` relying on supervisor multinode support was closed. This fix addresses the dependency of `TestUnsafeChainKnownToL2CL` and `TestUnsafeChainUnknownToL2CL` on multinode support, which is being deprecated. ([#16187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16187))

## NEW ISSUES
### Supervisor L1 Origin Validity
A new issue was opened concerning the `op-supervisor`'s handling of L1 origin validity during resets. The current reset logic only checks consistency between local and node safe databases, lacking a check for the canonical nature of the L1 origin. This could lead to issues if the L1 chain changes during a reset. ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16315))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-supervisor: Fix ability to provide data for fault proofs with non-genesis interop ([#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16166))
Discussion continues on how to enable `op-supervisor` to provide data for fault proofs with non-genesis interop. The core problem is that `op-challenger` doesn't fully support non-Genesis Interop upgrades, leading to issues when proving the non-genesis activation block. Recent comments suggest two main options:
1.  **Challenger-side construction:** The `op-challenger` could manually construct the required data from rollup nodes or via the supervisor as a proxy, similar to how output roots are handled. This would avoid reliance on the supervisor's database for pre-interop data.
2.  **Supervisor indexing:** The `op-supervisor` could start indexing its safe database from the first derived block it receives, even if pre-Interop, allowing it to serve super roots consistently. This would remove any special meaning of the first block in the safe database.

There's a consensus that fixing this before moving forward with devnets is crucial, as the current code isn't viable for the migration process. It was also noted that fixing this in the `op-supervisor` is preferred, as the `op-challenger` lacks the necessary information.

### eth_getTransactionCount returns incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending txs ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/623))
This issue, concerning an incorrect nonce returned by `eth_getTransactionCount` on the Base node, remains active. The problem caused a transaction to get stuck in the mempool due to an incorrect nonce being used. Users are requesting updates on the resolution of this issue.
