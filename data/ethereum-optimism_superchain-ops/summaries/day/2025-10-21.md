## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `mise` Installation Error
- Issue [#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17963) reports an Optimism `mise` install error due to a version pre-fix "v" causing incorrect URL formatting. The latest comment suggests this is an issue with the latest `mise` version and recommends using the install script from the latest `develop` branch of Optimism to get a working version of `mise`.

### `op-geth` Preparation for Fusaka
- Issue [#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/682) tracks the preparation of `op-geth` for the Fusaka upgrade. The latest comment confirms that the `op-geth` update for Sepolia is complete, but it is still pending for Mainnet.

### Fusaka Defense: Absolute Prestate Update
- Issue [#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1206) concerns writing a `superchain-ops` task to update the absolute prestate for Fusaka defense. The latest comment indicates that this task has been completed and executed on Sepolia, with a question raised about keeping the ticket open to track the Mainnet task.
