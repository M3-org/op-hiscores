## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fusaka Upgrade Preparations
Discussions continued regarding the `op-geth` preparation for the Fusaka upgrade ([#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/682)). It was confirmed that the Sepolia preparation is complete, but the Mainnet update is still pending. Relatedly, the task for updating the absolute prestate for Fusaka defense ([#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1206)) has been executed on Sepolia, with a question raised about keeping the ticket open to track the Mainnet task.

### Build Environment Issues
An issue was reported regarding an Optimism `mise install` error due to a version pre-fix "v" ([#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17963)). The latest comment suggests that this is an issue with the newest version of `mise` and recommends using the install script from the latest `develop` branch of the `optimism` repository to ensure compatibility.

### Observability in Sysgo
A discussion is ongoing about enabling observability/monitoring in sysgo for op-stack devnets ([#17941](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17941)). A recent comment suggests this might be a duplicate of an existing issue in the main `optimism` repository.
