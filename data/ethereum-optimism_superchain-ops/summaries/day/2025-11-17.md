# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on introducing new templates for vault upgrades and revenue sharing, alongside significant issue closures related to test flakiness and outdated concerns.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Vault Upgrade and Revenue Sharing Templates
New templates have been introduced to streamline the process of upgrading vaults and enabling revenue sharing for chains. These templates cover various scenarios, including upgrading vaults with or without immediate revenue sharing, and late opt-in options. This enhancement provides greater flexibility and simplifies the integration of revenue sharing mechanisms within the Superchain ecosystem.
- feat: introduce templates for vaults upgrade and revenue share opt in ([#1257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1257))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A work-in-progress pull request, [#1298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1298), has been opened to explore safer safe templates.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolution of Flaky Tests
Several issues related to flaky tests have been closed, indicating improved stability and reliability in the testing suite. These include tests concerning L2 network divergence, channel manager memory, and timestamp invariants.
- L2 networks diverge over multiple reorg test runs, leading to errors ([#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15782))
- Flaky test: TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17966))
- [op-acceptance-tests] Parallelise "memory-all" job ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17525))
- Flaky test: TestMissingBatchE2E ([#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18138))

### Addressing Outdated Technical Concerns
Multiple older issues, primarily related to `op-node` performance, `op-geth` state DB corruption, and Engine API specifications, have been closed due to their age or resolution in newer releases.
- op-node v1.13.3: thousands of stuck goroutines in p2p.SyncClient / libp2p ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16332))
- op-geth full node state DB corruption after following upgrade path from `v1.101411.8` to `v1.101500.0` ([#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/549))
- Ensure Engine API status/error return values match spec ([#596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/596))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-devstack: sysext: fix address book ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15817))
This issue, created on May 9, 2025, concerns the `sysext` address book not being updated to reflect changes in the KT local devnet description. Initially, the issue was closed on November 17, 2025, by mslipper, stating that "KT is deprecated." However, ajsutton reopened it on November 18, 2025, noting that "there are a bunch of TODOs still for this issue," indicating that the problem persists despite the deprecation of KT.

### min-base-fee: conduct simulations which prove effectiveness of the feature ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16958))
Created on August 5, 2025, this issue proposes using Kurtosis devnet, a transaction spamming tool, and batcher throttling to simulate a priority fee auction on L2. The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of different minimum base fees in ending the auction more rapidly. On November 17, 2025, mslipper questioned the relevance of this issue, asking "@geoknee is this still relevant?".

### min-base-fee: runbook for low batcher throughput ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16959))
This issue, created on August 5, 2025, focuses on establishing alerting mechanisms for high `MinBaseFee` settings that could lead to unincluded transactions and reduced batcher throughput. It also calls for a runbook to guide responses to such scenarios. Similar to [#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16958), mslipper inquired about its current relevance on November 17, 2025, asking "@geoknee is this still relevant?".

### op-acceptance-test: add back op-reth to jovian kt-devnet ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17475))
Created on September 16, 2025, this issue tracks the re-integration of `op-reth` into the Jovian KT-devnet once it supports the min base fee. The context highlights that `op-reth` currently lacks this feature. On October 2, 2025, geoknee suggested that since Kurtosis devnet is deprecated, `op-reth` should instead be integrated into the devstack/sysgo system. On November 17, 2025, mslipper asked "@geoknee / @theochap is this still relevant?", indicating a need to reassess the issue's current applicability given the changes in development infrastructure.

### Flaky test: TestBreakTimestampInvariant ([#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18137))
This issue, opened on November 3, 2025, reports a flaky test. On November 17, 2025, mslipper provided an example failure link from CircleCI, confirming the ongoing flakiness of the `TestBreakTimestampInvariant` test.
