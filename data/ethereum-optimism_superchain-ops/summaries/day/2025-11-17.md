# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant feature development with the introduction of new templates for vault upgrades and revenue sharing. Several long-standing issues were closed, primarily due to age or resolution in later releases.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Revenue Sharing and Vault Upgrade Templates
New templates have been introduced to facilitate vault upgrades and enable revenue sharing for chains. These templates offer flexible paths, allowing chains to upgrade vaults with or without immediate revenue sharing, or to opt-in to revenue sharing at a later stage. This includes new Solidity libraries and extensive integration tests to ensure functionality and robustness. ([#1257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1257))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#1298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1298), titled "WIP on safer safes template," was opened and is currently a work in progress.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Deprecated and Aged Issues Cleanup
Several issues related to `op-devstack` and `op-node` were closed due to being outdated or resolved in newer releases. This includes a fix for the address book in `op-devstack` ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15817)), and issues concerning `op-node` goroutine stalls ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16332)) and L2 network divergence during reorg tests ([#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/15782)).

### Test Flakiness and Acceptance Test Parallelization
A flaky test related to `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` was closed as it has not been observed recently ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17966)). Additionally, the issue to parallelize the "memory-all" job in `op-acceptance-tests` was closed as it is no longer needed ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17525)).

### Engine API and State DB Corruption
An issue regarding Engine API status/error return values was closed due to age ([#596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/596)). A problem with `op-geth` full node state DB corruption after an upgrade path was also closed, with a note to reopen if the issue recurs ([#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/549)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Min-Base-Fee Feature Effectiveness and Runbook
Discussions continue on the `min-base-fee` feature. Queries were raised regarding the relevance of conducting simulations to prove its effectiveness ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16958)) and the need for a runbook for low batcher throughput scenarios ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16959)). The latest comments from mslipper question the current relevance of these tasks.

### Op-Reth Integration into Devstack
The issue of adding `op-reth` back to the Jovian `kt-devnet` was discussed, with the latest comment from mslipper questioning its relevance. An earlier comment from geoknee suggested that with the deprecation of Kurtosis devnet, `op-reth` should instead be integrated into the `devstack / sysgo` system ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17475)).

### Flaky Test: TestMissingBatchE2E
This issue remains active, with the latest comment from pcw109550 providing detailed logs of a failure, indicating an error where a transaction was found in the verifier when it should not have been included ([#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18138)). The test failed with an "expected: *errors.errorString(&errors.errorString{s:"not found"}) actual : *rpc.jsonError(&rpc.jsonError{Code:-32000, Message:"transaction indexing is in progress", Data:"transaction indexing is in progress"})" error.
