# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Dec 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on integrating a new feature for Worldchain, updating test configurations, and refining internal processes. Several issues related to ZK game types and challenger functionality were closed, indicating progress in these areas.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Worldchain Integration and Configuration Updates
A new feature was added to set the Worldchain L2PAO key handback as executed on Sepolia. This involved updating a README file to reflect the change. Additionally, test configurations were updated to include "soneium," impacting various integration and regression tests.
- Features Added: [#1315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1315)
- Tests Added: [#1309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1309)

### Internal Tooling and Process Improvements
Work continued on a safer safes template, with updates to a migration template and associated test configurations. The `CODEOWNERS` file was also updated to assign solutions to the Sepolia task directory, pending GitHub permissions.
- Other Work: [#1298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1298), [#1306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1306)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#1314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1314): This PR proposes adding an `AddGameType` task for the u18-alphanet.
- [#1313](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1313): This PR introduces an "Upgrade 18 Template."

## CLOSED ISSUES

### ZK Proof Generation and Challenger Enhancements
Several issues related to the generation of ZK proofs and the functionality of the `op-challenger` were closed. This includes the decision to use the succinct proposer for ZK proof generation [#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18319) and the implementation of support for challenging ZK game types in `op-challenger` [#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18321).

### Challenger Configuration and Reliability
Issues concerning the `challenger`'s ability to read from the DGF registry [#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18412), fetch challenger bond from game arguments [#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18413), reload bond values [#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18414), and support challenger address changes [#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18415) were all closed. This indicates progress in making the challenger more robust and adaptable.

### Challenger Test Coverage
An issue focused on improving test coverage for the `challenger` was closed [#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18427), with the rationale that `op-challenger` will be used to challenge ZK games.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Unused OP Constants
Issue [#13440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/13440) highlights that most OP constants are unused, with only `OP_LOAD_DOUBLE_LEFT` and `OP_LOAD_DOUBLE_RIGHT` seeing limited use. The latest comment from `blockhunter270-boop` at 2025-12-03T18:26:33Z suggests that this issue might already be resolved and asks for confirmation to close it.

### Acceptance Tests for New EIPs
Issue [#18221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18221) outlines the plan to write acceptance tests for EIP-7642 and EIP-7823 (Upper-Bound MODEXP). `joshklop` commented at 2025-12-03T17:25:06Z that additional acceptance tests might be added to ensure features not included in `fusaka-on-l2` are properly disabled on OP chains.

### op-node Stuck in EL Sync Mode
Issue [#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18468) describes a problem where `op-node` gets stuck in an initialization loop when restarted with `--syncmode=execution-layer` after `reth` has already synced. `dalechyn` confirmed at 2025-12-03T14:15:25Z that they are experiencing the same issue, which is blocking their Base Mainnet node.
