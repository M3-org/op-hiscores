# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Dec 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on integrating Worldchain L2PAO key handback on Sepolia, updating test configurations, and refining internal processes. Several issues related to ZK proof generation and challenger support were closed, indicating progress in these areas.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Worldchain Integration & Configuration Updates
- Integrated the Worldchain L2PAO key handback as executed on Sepolia, marking a step forward in Superchain interoperability ([#1315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1315)).
- Updated various test configurations, including those for Soneium, impacting integration and regression tests ([#1309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1309)).

### Internal Process Improvements
- Initiated work on a safer safes template, indicating efforts towards enhanced security or deployment processes ([#1298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1298)).
- Updated the CODEOWNERS file to include solutions for the Sepolia task directory, streamlining ownership and review processes ([#1306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1306)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#1314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1314): "u18-alphanet: Add AddGameType task" - This PR aims to introduce a new task for adding game types, likely related to dispute resolution or challenge mechanisms.
- [#1313](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1313): "Upgrade 18 Template" - This PR proposes an upgrade template, suggesting preparations for a new protocol version or significant system update.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### ZK Proof Generation and Challenger Enhancements
- The investigation into which service should generate ZK proofs was concluded, with the decision to use the succinct proposer for proof generation ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18319)).
- Support for challenging ZK game types in `op-challenger` was marked as complete, with further acceptance tests to be tracked separately ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18321)).

### Challenger Module Refinements
- Several issues related to the `challenger` module were closed, indicating progress in its development. These include improvements to test coverage ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18427)), reading from the DGF registry ([#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18412)), fetching challenger bond from game args ([#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18413)), reloading bond values ([#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18414)), and supporting challenger address changes ([#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18415)). The closures indicate that `op-challenger` will be used for ZK games and can handle these functionalities.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### OP Constants Usage
- **[#13440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/13440) Most of OP constants are not used**: A comment from `blockhunter270-boop` on 2025-12-03T18:26:33Z suggests that this issue might already be resolved and asks for its closure. The issue highlights that many defined OP constants are unused, with direct values being used instead in some cases.

### Acceptance Tests for New EIPs
- **[#18221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18221) fusaka-on-l2: write acceptance tests for new EIPs**: `joshklop` commented on 2025-12-03T17:25:06Z, suggesting the addition of acceptance tests to ensure that features not included in `fusaka-on-l2` are properly disabled on OP chains. The issue aims to write acceptance tests for EIP-7642 and EIP-7823.

### op-node EL Sync Mode Issue
- **[#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18468) op-node stuck in EL sync mode after restart when reth already has synced data**: `dalechyn` reported on 2025-12-03T14:15:25Z that they are experiencing the same issue, which is blocking their Base Mainnet node configured for execution layer syncing. `louisliu2048` provided a temporary workaround on 2025-12-04T02:13:42Z, suggesting changing the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restarting the `op-node`. The issue describes `op-node` getting stuck in an initialization loop when restarted in `--syncmode=execution-layer` after `reth` has already synced data.
