# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Nov 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining U17 task documentation and status updates, alongside addressing compatibility issues in acceptance tests and enhancing op-program hints.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### U17 Task Management and Documentation
Efforts were made to correct README files for U17 sign commands across various chains, ensuring accuracy and clarity for users. Additionally, the status of U17 Sepolia tasks was updated to "executed," reflecting their completion. A previous U17 Base Sepolia task was also reverted.
- [#1292](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1292)
- [#1297](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1297)
- [#1293](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1293)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A pull request [#1296](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1296) was opened to fix nonce updates for U17-op-task state overrides.
- Another pull request [#1294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1294) was opened for U17 base Sepolia.
- A pull request [#1291](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1291) was opened to fix how the "From" address is obtained in L2 simulation.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Op-Program Hinting for Block Header Oracle
An issue regarding adding a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in op-program was closed. The hint has been added, though it's not currently used as op-geth still handles the required data lookup. Kona's different lookup logic, which directly reads storage slots and outputs a hint, was noted as a relevant development.

### Kona Compatibility with Websockets in Acceptance Tests
An issue addressing Kona's compatibility with websockets URLs in acceptance tests was closed. Kona has been updated to resolve the incompatibility with the L2 EL websocket URL provided by sys go.

## NEW ISSUES

### Stack Signing Address Visibility
A new issue [#1295](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1295) was reported where `just sign-stack` does not show if the address used is an owner safe during stack simulation signing.
