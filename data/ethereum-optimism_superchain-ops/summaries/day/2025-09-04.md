# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Sep 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing CI reliability by fixing Slack alerts for failed Forge tests and removing unused RPC URLs. Discussions continued on several Flashblocks-related issues and a bug in `op-node/p2p/gossip` configuration.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD Enhancements
- Fixed CI alerts for failed Forge tests to ensure immediate notification of broken tests on `main` ([#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1184)).
- Removed unused RPC URLs from the CI configuration to streamline processes ([#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1184)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Configuration
- **Flashblocks on Mainnet and Sunnyside:** Discussions continued regarding the deployment and evaluation of Flashblocks on mainnet sequencers ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16759)) and Sunnyside sequencers ([#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16761)). For mainnet, the focus is on deploying `rollup-boost` in disabled mode, observing stability, and then enabling execution. For Sunnyside, `op-rbuilder` is deployed and synced, with next steps involving `rollup-boost` deployment and execution mode enablement.
- **Flashblocks Infrastructure:** Progress on deploying `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` ([#16763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16763)) is blocked by the availability of websocket connections for conductors, though a PR is in progress. The need for `flashblocks-rpc` node deployment ([#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16764)) is being re-evaluated.
- **Flashblocks Spec Finalization:** Associated PRs for closing out the Flashblocks specification are being tracked ([#17162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17162)).
- **Flashblocks on `op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-1` Mainnet:** Work is underway to enable Flashblocks on this specific mainnet sequencer, involving `rollup-boost` deployment and subsequent execution mode enablement after stability observation ([#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17317)).

### `op-node/p2p/gossip` Configuration Bug
- A bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values was discussed ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17308)). The issue arises from `libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub` panicking when `Dhi=0` and `Dscore=4`, which occurs because `MeshDHi` is unset in tests, defaulting to 0 and clobbering the intended default of 12. A potential solution of adding a `DefaultP2PConfig` method for valid defaults was suggested.

### `op-geth` Initialization Error
- Users continue to report "head block is not reachable" errors during `op-geth` initialization ([#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/420)). While some users suggest continuing with setup as the error might not be critical, others report `geth` remaining at Block 0 and issues with parent block nil errors.

### Sync-Tester Network Exposure
- Discussions are ongoing to expose more networks inside the CI box for `op-sync-tester` ([#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/454)). L2 ELs for mainnet and Sepolia are currently exposed, with the remaining task being the exposure of an L1 beacon API in CI. A draft PR to make the synctest more dynamic with environment variables has been shared.
