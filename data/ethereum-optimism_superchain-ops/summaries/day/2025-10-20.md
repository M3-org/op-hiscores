# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Oct 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on testing and configuration updates, specifically setting the respected GameType for Soneium Testnet. Discussions on active issues revolved around DA Footprint Limit implementation, `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` marshaling, and improving `op-up` for local development.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Testnet Configuration Updates
A new test was added to ensure the Soneium Testnet's respected GameType is correctly set to Permissionless, indicating a focus on proper configuration for test environments ([#1256](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1256)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A pull request was opened for the Worldchain Sepolia U12 to U16a Upgrade ([#1258](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1258)).
- Another pull request introduces templates for vault upgrades and revenue share opt-in features ([#1257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1257)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### DA Footprint Limit Implementation
Discussion on the DA Footprint Limit implementation ([#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17551)) indicates that progress is currently blocked by a pending spec derivation in another repository.

### Rollup Configuration Marshaling
The issue regarding marshaling new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17907)) is being discussed, with a focus on whether to update `op-succinct/kailua` or introduce nullable system config fields to avoid uncoordinated API changes.

### Improving `op-up` for Local Development
There's an ongoing discussion about enhancing `op-up` to serve as a `sysgo` runner for local development ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17942)), especially with the deprecation of Kurtosis. The conversation also includes considering if a CLI tool is truly necessary given the simplicity of creating long-running acceptance tests.
