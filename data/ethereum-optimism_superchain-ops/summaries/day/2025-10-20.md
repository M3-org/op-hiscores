## ACTIVE ISSUES
### DA Footprint Limit Implementation
The implementation of the DA Footprint Limit [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17551) is currently blocked by the need for a spec derivation, as noted by sebastianst.

### `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` Marshaling
Discussion around [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17907) focuses on whether to avoid marshaling new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active to prevent breaking zk stacks. geoknee is checking with @emilianobonassi about the possibility of justifying this change to avoid uncoordinated API updates, while tynes questioned if updating `op-succinct/kailua` would be a better alternative to adding a nullable system config.

### Improving `op-up` for Local Development
Issue [#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17942) discusses enhancing `op-up` to serve as a sysgo runner for local development, replacing Kurtosis. joshklop suggested considering if a CLI tool is truly necessary, given the simplicity of creating long-running acceptance tests.
