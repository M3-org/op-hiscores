# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Oct 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on updating and adding new templates for game types, alongside marking specific tasks as executed. This work primarily involved refining existing functionalities and preparing for future integrations within the Superchain ecosystem.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Template Updates and Additions
New templates for `SetRespectedGameTypeTemplate.sol` and `AddGameTypeTemplate.sol` were introduced or updated, superseding previous PRs. These changes aim to streamline the process of defining and managing game types within the Superchain.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher: prepare for Fusaka ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17472))
The discussion on this issue, concerning the `op-batcher`'s adaptation to Fusaka's activation on L1, was re-opened. The latest comment emphasizes the need for a new batcher version that automatically switches to cell proofs and incorporates the mainnet Fusaka activation time via `op-service` / `op-geth`. Previously, manual testing against a Fusaka L1 was suggested.

### op-batcher: ensure full shutdown when "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" ([#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17768))
The latest thinking on this issue, which addresses the `op-batcher`'s behavior when the "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" error occurs, suggests maintaining the current detection logic. Instead of introducing new metrics or logs, the focus is on ensuring the entire process exits upon encountering the error. This would allow the batcher to enter a crashloop and automatically recover once the `SetMaxDASize` RPC method becomes available again.
