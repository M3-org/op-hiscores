## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher: prepare for Fusaka ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17472))
The discussion on this issue, concerning the op-batcher's behavior during the Fusaka activation on L1, was re-opened. The latest comment from `geoknee` on October 17, 2025, indicates a plan to release a new batcher version that will automatically switch to cell proofs and incorporate the mainnet Fusaka time via `op-service / op-geth`. Previously, `geoknee` also provided a recipe for manual testing against a Fusaka L1.

### op-batcher: ensure full shutdown when "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" ([#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17768))
The latest update from `geoknee` on October 17, 2025, suggests maintaining the current detection logic for the "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" error. Instead of introducing new metrics or logs, the focus will be on ensuring the entire batcher process exits upon encountering this error. This will allow the batcher to enter a crashloop and automatically recover once the RPC method becomes available again.
