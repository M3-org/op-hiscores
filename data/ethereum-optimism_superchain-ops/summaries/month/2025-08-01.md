# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
August was a month of significant modernization and preparation for future upgrades within the `superchain-ops` repository. Development was heavily focused on expanding and migrating to a new templating framework, which saw the addition of several new templates for upgrades and contract interactions. A major cleanup effort resulted in the removal of the legacy `superchain-ops` system, streamlining the codebase. Concurrently, substantial work was done to improve CI/CD reliability and developer workflows by increasing test coverage and mitigating flaky tests. Key discussions this month laid the groundwork for future architectural changes, including a planned migration of the OP Deployer to use Forge and a re-evaluation of the `op-node` P2P sync mechanism.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on enhancing the templating system, improving developer tooling, and introducing new core functionalities.

- **Templating Framework Expansion & Migration:** The new templating framework was a primary focus, with several additions to support upgrades and new functionalities.
    - A template was introduced to streamline upgrades from U13 directly to U16, simplifying the process for chains on older versions ([#1144]).
    - New templates were added for `BlacklistGamesV400` ([#1170]), `UpdateRetirementTimestampV400` ([#1171]), and executing L2 actions via the L1 `OptimismPortal` ([#1173]).
    - Migration efforts continued with the creation of a new blacklist game template ([#1168]), leading to the closure of the corresponding migration task ([#1162]).
    - A fix was implemented for the `set respected game template` ([#1157]).

- **CI/CD and Developer Workflow Improvements:** Several PRs aimed to make the development and testing process more robust and efficient.
    - The CI configuration was cleaned up by removing obsolete jobs and tasks ([#1164]).
    - To reduce CI flakiness, retries were implemented for both forge scripts ([#1161]) and simulation scripts ([#1172]).
    - Test coverage was significantly increased for core contracts like `SimpleAddressRegistry.sol`, `StackedSimulator.sol`, and `TaskManager.sol` ([#1166]).

- **Core Functionality and Refactoring:**
    - A major security and flexibility enhancement was merged, enabling multi-level nesting for Gnosis Safe signing ([#1150]).
    - In a significant cleanup effort, the entire legacy `superchain-ops` system was removed from the `main` branch, simplifying the repository structure ([#1163]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month saw the resolution of major testing and specification tasks, while new discussions paved the way for future architectural shifts.

- **Closed Issues:** Key problems resolved this month include:
    - **Protocol Specification:** The issue to write the `min-base-fee` specification was closed, marking the completion of its formal documentation ([#742]).
    - **Testing & Validation:** The umbrella issue for proofs interop acceptance testing ([#15946]) and its sub-task for `op-challenger` tests ([#15948]) were closed, confirming the functionality of the dispute system on interop chains.
    - **System Operations:** An issue confirming that all Sunnyside sequencers are running with Flashblocks was closed ([#16688]).
    - **Task Migration:** The issue tracking the migration of blacklist games tasks to the new template framework was successfully closed ([#1162]).

- **New & Active Issues:** Discussions this month highlighted several areas of future work and ongoing challenges:
    - **Forge Deployer Migration:** A series of new tracking issues ([#17213], [#17214], [#17215], [#17216], [#17217], [#17218]) were created to plan the migration of the OP Deployer to use Forge. This represents a significant upcoming effort to modernize deployment tooling.
    - **`op-node` Sync Protocol:** A critical discussion emerged around the deprecation of the `req-resp` p2p sync protocol in `op-node` ([#14108]). An alternative, simpler sync mechanism was prototyped and discussed as a potential replacement to address existing sync problems and improve performance.
    - **CI Integration:** A new issue was opened to explore running the monorepo CI suite on `op-geth` PRs to prevent regressions ([#665]).
    - **Flashblocks Monitoring:** Active discussions continued around creating alerts for flashblocks-enabled sequencers, focusing on peer count and activation status ([#16867], [#16868]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
August saw strong engagement from the community, particularly in planning future development and improving documentation.

- A notable example of community initiative was seen in the "Forge Deployer" migration planning, where contributor `tooshiNoko` proactively offered to take on all related tasks to accelerate the effort ([#17213] - [#17218]).
- The technical discussion around deprecating the `req-resp` sync protocol ([#14108]) was enriched by a detailed proposal and prototype from `@emilianobonassi`, demonstrating deep community involvement in core protocol architecture.
- Collaborative efforts to improve documentation were also evident, with a "rich PR" noted in issue [#1530] that aims to overhaul the documentation for creating an OP Stack Rollup testnet, addressing confusion for external chain operators.
