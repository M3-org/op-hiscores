# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's efforts focused on enhancing cross-chain functionality and finalizing major network upgrade tasks. A significant new feature was introduced to enable L1 to L2 call execution via the Optimism Portal, directly improving Superchain interoperability. The team also closed out several long-standing items, including the main tracking issue for the Isthmus upgrade and a test for the Fusaka activation. While progress was made on multiple fronts, a key technical challenge emerged with a Go 1.25 compatibility issue in Cannon, which is currently blocking further work and is under active investigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on delivering a key interoperability feature and making incremental improvements to system performance and stability.

- **L1 to L2 Call Execution:** A major feature was merged to enable L1 to L2 call execution using the Optimism Portal. This change introduces a new template and configuration-driven parameters specifically for dispatching L2 calls from an L1 Safe, a crucial step for enhancing cross-chain operations within the Superchain ([#1231](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1231)).

- **Performance and CI Optimizations:** Minor but important refinements were made to the codebase. Base commands were modified to improve their execution speed ([#1241](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1241)), and an example task was updated to pin a block number, resolving a CircleCI issue ([#1240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1240)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The month saw a strong focus on closing out historical issues related to network upgrades and tooling, while also identifying a significant external dependency as a blocker.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Network Upgrade Finalization:** The tracking issue for the Isthmus upgrade was officially closed, marking the completion of that network event ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/12703)). Additionally, a test for Fusaka activation on L1 was successfully implemented and closed ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17500)).
    - **Tooling and Process Refinements:** Several issues were resolved by improving internal processes. An issue to enhance acceptance test reporting was closed, with the work completed in the `infra` repository ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/386]). Similarly, flashblock alert refinement was completed in the `k8s` repository ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17423)).
    - **Strategic Decisions:** A proposal to refactor the `op-node` CLI was closed as "not planned" ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16680)). The team also decided to move away from negative testing for chain configurations in favor of a report-based approach ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/686)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Go 1.25 Compatibility Blocker:** The most critical active issue is Cannon's incompatibility with Go 1.25, which causes incorrect Keccak hashes. It was confirmed that the Go 1.25.1 release does not contain the necessary MIPS fix, making this an external blocker for the team ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17060)).
    - **Tooling Strategy Shift:** The integration of `op-reth` is being re-evaluated. With the Kurtosis devnet now deprecated, the focus has shifted to integrating `op-reth` into the `devstack` or `sysgo` systems instead, reflecting an adaptation in the project's development tooling strategy ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17475)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident through cross-repository efforts, with issues in `superchain-ops` being resolved by pull requests in the `infra` and `k8s` repositories. This highlights effective coordination across different parts of the Optimism ecosystem. Active discussions on issues like the Go 1.25 compatibility and the `op-reth` integration strategy demonstrate a proactive approach to problem-solving and strategic planning within the core team. The overall activity reflects a healthy balance between shipping new features and diligently maintaining the existing infrastructure.
