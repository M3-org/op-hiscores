# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of significant milestones and focused problem-solving. The team successfully finalized the Isthmus upgrade, a major achievement for the ecosystem. A key new feature was introduced to enable L1 to L2 call execution via the Optimism Portal, directly enhancing Superchain interoperability. Efforts were also concentrated on improving the stability and coordination of the Flashblocks system. However, progress on some fronts is challenged by an ongoing Go 1.25 compatibility issue affecting Cannon, which remains a critical blocker for fault-proof development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on enhancing cross-chain functionality, improving tooling, and managing network upgrades.

*   **L1-to-L2 Interoperability:** A significant new feature was added to enable L1 to L2 call execution using the Optimism Portal. This update provides a new template and configuration-driven parameters specifically for dispatching L2 calls from an L1 Safe, improving cross-chain operational capabilities ([#1231](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1231)).

*   **Tooling and Task Management:**
    *   Usability for `op-txverify` was improved with the addition of new validation instructions ([#1251](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1251)).
    *   Base commands were optimized for faster execution speed ([#1241](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1241)).
    *   Several upgrade tasks for Arena and Swell were officially marked as executed, reflecting their successful deployment ([#1250](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1250)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in October centered on closing out major upgrade trackers, resolving stability issues, and navigating persistent external dependencies.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Major Upgrades Completed:** The tracking issue for the Isthmus upgrade was officially closed, marking its successful completion ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/12703)). Additionally, testing for the Fusaka activation on L1 was implemented and closed ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17500)).
    *   **Flashblocks Stability:** A series of issues related to Flashblocks were resolved. A fix was implemented for dropped connections in the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17856)), and coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers for a new node was successfully completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17857)).
    *   **Specification & Refactoring:** The Data Availability footprint specification was updated to use the `blobBaseFee` header field ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/792)). An issue to refactor the `op-node` CLI was closed as "not planned" ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16680)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Go 1.25 Compatibility Blocker:** A critical issue persists with Cannon's compatibility with Go 1.25, which causes incorrect Keccak hashes. The problem is blocked by a required MIPS fix that was not included in the Go 1.25.1 release, hindering fault-proof-related work ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17060)).
    *   **Dispute Monitoring Logic:** An important discussion is underway for `op-dispute-mon` on how to handle out-of-sync nodes when multiple RPCs are used. The proposed solution is to check a node's `syncStatus` against the L1 block of the dispute game's creation and ignore results from nodes that are too far behind ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17814)).
    *   **Ongoing Implementations:** An issue regarding the v2 dispute game implementation in `OPCM.deploy` was reopened, as a `TODO` remains in the code, indicating further work is needed ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17257)). The integration of `op-reth` is also being re-evaluated to target the `devstack` following the deprecation of the Kurtosis devnet ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17475)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the successful coordination with external Flashblocks RPC providers to integrate a new node ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17857)). Internally, active discussions on key issues like the `op-dispute-mon` logic ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17814)) and the Go 1.25 blocker ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17060)) highlight a focused, problem-solving dynamic within the team. The diligence in reopening an issue ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17257)) to ensure complete implementation further demonstrates a commitment to code quality and correctness.
