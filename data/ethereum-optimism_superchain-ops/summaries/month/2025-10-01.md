# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of significant milestones and focused problem-solving. The team successfully finalized the Isthmus network upgrade, a major achievement for the ecosystem. A key new feature was introduced to enable L1 to L2 call execution via the Optimism Portal, directly enhancing Superchain interoperability. Substantial effort was dedicated to stabilizing the Flashblocks service, with successful coordination with RPC providers and fixes for proxy stability. While progress was strong, the team continues to navigate a critical compatibility issue with Go 1.25 affecting Cannon, which remains a primary technical challenge.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on enhancing cross-chain functionality, executing network upgrades, and improving developer tooling.

*   **L1-to-L2 Interoperability:** A major feature was merged to enable L1 to L2 call execution from an L1 Safe using the Optimism Portal. This update includes a new template and configuration-driven parameters to streamline cross-chain interactions ([#1231](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1231)).

*   **Chain Maintenance & Upgrades:** Several tasks related to network upgrades were completed. Tasks for the Arena and Swell mainnets were marked as executed ([#1250](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1250)), and an example task was refined to resolve a CI issue ([#1240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1240)).

*   **Tooling & Performance:**
    *   New validation instructions were added for `op-txverify` to improve usability ([#1251](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1251)).
    *   Base commands were optimized for faster execution speed ([#1241](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1241)).
    *   A template for `SetRespectedGameTypeTemplate.sol` was updated ([#1252](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1252)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month centered on finalizing major upgrades, stabilizing Flashblocks, and addressing complex ongoing technical challenges.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Network Upgrades:** The tracking issue for the Isthmus upgrade was officially closed, marking its successful completion ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/12703)). Testing for the Fusaka activation on L1 was also completed and closed ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17500)).
    *   **Flashblocks Stability:** A series of issues related to Flashblocks were resolved. This included refining alerts ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17423)), fixing proxy connectivity issues that caused lost flashblocks ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17856)), and completing coordination with external RPC providers for a new node ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17857)).
    *   **Tooling & Protocol Refinements:** Several issues were closed, including an improvement to acceptance test reporting ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/386)), an update to the DA footprint block limit specification ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/792)), and a clarification on L2EL sync conditions ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17628)). A proposal to refactor the `op-node` CLI was closed as not planned ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16680)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility:** A significant ongoing issue is Cannon's incompatibility with Go 1.25, which causes incorrect Keccak hashes. The problem is blocked by a required MIPS fix that was not included in the Go 1.25.1 release, making this a critical external dependency ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17060)).
    *   **Dispute Monitor Logic:** Active discussion continues on how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes. The current challenge is that a lagging node can be incorrectly flagged as a disagreement. The proposed solution is to use `syncStatus` to verify a node has processed the relevant L1 block before including its results ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17814)).
    *   **Tooling Strategy:** The integration of `op-reth` is being re-evaluated. With the Kurtosis devnet now deprecated, the focus has shifted to integrating it into the `devstack` or `sysgo` systems ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17475)).
    *   **Incomplete Work:** An issue regarding the v2 dispute game implementation in OPCM.deploy was reopened, as a TODO item in the code indicates the work is not yet complete ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17257)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
While the reports indicate focused, internal development, a key example of ecosystem collaboration was the successful coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers. The team worked with external partners, including Blockscout, to ensure the smooth integration of a new Flashblocks RPC node ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17857)). Internally, active discussions on issues like the `op-dispute-mon` logic ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17814)) and Go compatibility ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17060)) demonstrate collaborative problem-solving on complex technical challenges facing the project.
