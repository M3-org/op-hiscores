# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September's efforts focused on enhancing system stability and developer experience while preparing for significant network and protocol upgrades. Key achievements include a substantial 40% performance boost in CI regression tests and the resolution of critical bugs affecting Worldchain and Go version compatibility. Concurrently, significant planning and discussion took place around the integration of Kona + Cannon fault proofs and upgrades for several Superchain networks, signaling a dual focus on immediate operational health and future architectural evolution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on performance, maintenance, and laying the groundwork for future features.

- **CI & Developer Experience Improvements:**
  - Continuous Integration performance was significantly improved by reducing concurrent processes and optimizing test scripts, resulting in a 40% speed increase for regression tests ([#1177](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1177), [#1178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1178)).
  - A compatibility bug was fixed by updating the Go version used by `mise`, ensuring tools like `eip712sign` function correctly ([#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1183)).
  - A new pull request was opened to fix CI alerts related to forge tests ([#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1184)).

- **Superchain Network Maintenance & Upgrades:**
  - A critical bug was fixed for Worldchain, ensuring the correct nonce is used during L1 ownership transfers ([#1176](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1176)).
  - Preparations for network-wide enhancements began with pull requests to upgrade Zora Sepolia ([#1180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1180)), Metal Sepolia ([#1181](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1181)), and Mode Sepolia ([#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1182)) from version U13 to U16.

- **Protocol Enhancements:**
  - A new feature was proposed to allow enabling and disabling LivenessModule2 templates, providing more flexibility in network configuration ([#1179](https://github.comcom/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1179)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed during this period, but several active issues saw significant discussion, highlighting key areas of future work.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - No issues were closed in this timeframe.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Kona + Cannon Integration:** A major focus of discussion was the upcoming support for Kona + Cannon fault proofs. Active issues ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17285), [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17286), [#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17283)) detail the necessary changes to `OPContractsManager.sol`, the `op-dispute-mon` service, and the management of absolute prestates. This represents a significant body of work for protocol decentralization.
  - **Developer Experience:** A discussion in [#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17184) centered on improving the CircleCI configuration, with contributors highlighting the difficulty of local testing and suggesting potential solutions like dynamic test sorting to optimize CI job duration.
  - **Bugs & Enhancements:**
    - A bug in P2P gossip configuration that causes panics due to zero values overwriting defaults is being addressed ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17308)).
    - The Sync Test suite was reopened ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/16703)) to ensure all OP Stack Hardfork transitions are properly tested.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical planning for future protocol upgrades. Discussions around Kona + Cannon support ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17285), [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17286)) showed active engagement from core contributors like `ajsutton` and `pauldowman` in defining implementation requirements. Furthermore, the active dialogue on improving CI/CD workflows ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17184)) and the submission of a PR alongside a bug report ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17308)) demonstrate a healthy and proactive contributor community focused on both long-term architecture and immediate developer quality of life.
