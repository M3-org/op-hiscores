# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
November was dominated by the coordinated rollout of the Jovian (U17) upgrade across the Superchain ecosystem. Significant effort was dedicated to preparing and executing the upgrade on OP betanets, sepolia-dev-0, and a wide array of mainnets including OP, Soneium, Ink, and Zora. This push was unblocked by a critical bug fix addressing a gas limit issue in `forge` that was impeding testnet deployments. Alongside this major upgrade, the team resolved key bugs related to altDA frame sizing and flaky tests, while continuing deep technical discussions on future improvements to core infrastructure like `proxyd` and blob fee management.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on deploying a major network upgrade and refining operational infrastructure.

- **Jovian (U17) Upgrade Rollout**
  The primary focus was the deployment of the Jovian U17 upgrade. Initial work involved preparing tasks and configurations for OP betanets and sepolia-dev-0 ([#1273]). A crucial bug was fixed where `forge` incorrectly handled gas limits, which unblocked the upgrade process ([#1280]). Following this, a wave of pull requests successfully implemented the U17 upgrade tasks for numerous mainnets: OP, Soneium, Ink ([#1268]), Unichain ([#1271]), Arena-Z, Swell ([#1270]), and Metal, Mode, Zora ([#1269]). Further work was done to organize the Sepolia stack upgrade tasks ([#1285], [#1286]).

- **Configuration and CI/CD Improvements**
  Several updates were made to improve operational efficiency and reliability. The OPCMv500 upgrade template was enhanced to improve address fetching and validation, reducing reliance on hardcoded values ([#1282]). For improved stability, the RPC configuration for Sepolia was switched from Tenderly to a public node ([#1281]). To accelerate the high volume of U17-related pull requests, regression tests were temporarily removed from the CI pipeline, with plans to reinstate them later ([#1283]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on resolving blocking bugs and discussing long-term architectural challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
  Several important issues were resolved and closed this month:
  - **Bug Fixes:** A bug in `op-batcher` that incorrectly limited the max frame size in generic commitment mode for altDA was fixed ([#17796]). A flaky test, `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor`, was also resolved ([#17548]).
  - **Process Improvement:** An issue for reporting unused acceptance tests was closed ([#16273]), as the team's shift to "gateless mode" made the original requirement obsolete.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  No new issues were opened in the reporting period, but discussions on several key active issues highlighted areas of future work:
  - **`proxyd` Reliability:** A significant discussion continued around `proxyd` returning old blocks when backends are out of sync, a phenomenon described as "backwards time travel" ([#501]). Proposed solutions include implementing a "multicall" strategy, better error handling, and various sticky session approaches.
  - **Blob Fee Management:** The need for more sophisticated blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr` was discussed in [#18102], as the standard `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` RPC is insufficient for blob transactions.
  - **Test Coverage:** A gap in `op-acceptance-tests` was identified ([#16450]), where the `sysgo` orchestrator lacks support for flashblocks/rbuiders. Adding this support is desired to validate changes related to `kona-node` and `rollup-boost`.
  - **Documentation:** A discussion on documenting the DA Footprint Limit ([#1742]) emphasized the need to clarify risks and its interaction with gas limit changes.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The month's activity demonstrated strong, coordinated execution across the team, particularly for the multi-chain Jovian U17 upgrade. The large number of related PRs merged in a short period suggests a high degree of planning and collaboration. The decision to temporarily disable regression tests ([#1283]) to expedite these merges further points to a pragmatic, goal-oriented team dynamic.

Deep technical collaboration is evident in the active issue discussions, such as the detailed exploration of potential solutions for the `proxyd` time travel problem ([#501]). Furthermore, a comment on the closed altDA issue ([#17796]) requesting an update to the Optimism specs highlights a commitment to maintaining consistency between the codebase and official documentation.
