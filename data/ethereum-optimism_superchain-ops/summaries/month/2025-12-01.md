# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December was a month of significant progress in expanding the Superchain and hardening its operational components. Key efforts focused on integrating new chains like Base and Worldchain, advancing the ZK challenge system, and addressing critical node synchronization issues reported by the community. While several long-standing documentation and stability problems were resolved, ongoing discussions around node sync behavior highlight a continued focus on improving the reliability and experience for node operators across the ecosystem. Preparatory work for the upcoming U18 upgrade also commenced, signaling a forward-looking development trajectory.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on integrating new chains, preparing for future upgrades, and enhancing testnet capabilities.

*   **Superchain Chain Integrations:**
    *   The Superchain continued to expand with the integration of Base as an executed U17 ([#1312](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1312)).
    *   Significant work was done for Worldchain, including implementing a key handback task on Sepolia ([#1284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1284)) and integrating the L2PAO key handback as executed ([#1315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1315)).

*   **Testnet & Challenge System Enhancements:**
    *   The Soneium Minato Testnet was enhanced with the addition of a permissionless game type, which was subsequently set as the respected game type, improving its dispute resolution capabilities ([#1317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1317), [#1320](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1320)).
    *   A new task was introduced to add game types for the U18 alphanet, likely related to dispute mechanisms for the next upgrade ([#1314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1314)).

*   **Preparations for U18 Upgrade:**
    *   Anticipating the next major version, work began on an upgrade template for U18 ([#1313](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1313)).
    *   New pull requests were opened to add betanet tasks ([#1319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1319)) and production configurations ([#1318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1318)) for U18.

*   **Internal Process & Configuration:**
    *   Internal security and deployment processes were improved with work on a safer safes template ([#1298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1298)).
    *   Ownership and review processes were streamlined by updating the CODEOWNERS file for the Sepolia task directory ([#1306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1306)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month was characterized by resolving critical node stability problems and finalizing a major feature set around ZK challenges, while new reports indicate that node synchronization remains a key area of focus.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Node Synchronization Stability:** A critical issue where `op-node` v1.16.3 failed to synchronize for multiple Superchain deployments was resolved. The fix required an upgrade and resync of `op-geth`, highlighting an important dependency for node operators ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18510)).
    *   **ZK Challenge System:** A large batch of issues related to the ZK challenge system was closed, marking a significant milestone. This included deciding to use the succinct proposer for ZK proof generation ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18319)), confirming support for ZK games in `op-challenger` ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18321)), and closing numerous issues related to the `challenger` module's functionality, such as test coverage, bond handling, and registry interactions ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18427), [#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18412), [#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18413)).
    *   **Node Operator Documentation:** Several documentation gaps were filled. The JSON-RPC API documentation was restructured for better clarity between `op-node` and `op-geth` ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1773)), and documentation for environment variables was restored ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/1874)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Ongoing Node Sync Challenges:** Despite some fixes, node synchronization remains a primary concern. Active discussions on `op-node` getting stuck in EL sync mode ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18468)) and nodes failing to sync with "missing trie node" errors ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18581)) indicate persistent challenges for operators, particularly around snapshot-based syncing.
    *   **Sequencer Recovery Mode:** A technical discussion is ongoing regarding a potential bug where the `op-node` sequencer enters recover mode during normal operation, causing errors on verifier nodes ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18350)).
    *   **Proxyd Time Travel Bug:** A long-standing issue where Proxyd can serve incorrect block data when backends are out of sync ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/501)) saw renewed attention, with a developer committing to address it in early January.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly visible in the active issue threads concerning node operations. Multiple users experiencing synchronization problems on chains like Optimism, Base, and Unichain came together in issues like [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18510) and [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18581) to share logs and confirm symptoms. This community feedback loop was crucial for diagnosing problems. In one instance ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18468)), a community member provided a temporary workaround for others, demonstrating a healthy, supportive ecosystem. Internally, the commitment to tackle the Proxyd bug ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/501)) shows clear team coordination and long-term planning.
