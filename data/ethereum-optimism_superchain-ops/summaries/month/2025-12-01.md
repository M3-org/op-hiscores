# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December's development focused heavily on expanding the Superchain ecosystem and advancing the capabilities of the challenge system. Significant progress was made in integrating new chains, with Base being added as an executed U17 and key handback tasks completed for Worldchain on Sepolia. Concurrently, a major push was made to solidify support for ZK games, culminating in the decision to utilize `op-challenger` and the closure of numerous related issues. While development progressed, several critical node operation issues were actively discussed, highlighting ongoing challenges in synchronization and block validation for operators.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on integrating new chains and refining internal processes for future upgrades.

- **Superchain Integration & Configuration:** The ecosystem continued to grow with several key integrations. Base was officially integrated as an executed U17 ([#1312](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1312)), a significant step for Superchain interoperability. The integration of Worldchain also advanced, with the addition of a key handback task on Sepolia ([#1284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1284)) and the subsequent execution of the L2PAO key handback ([#1315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1315)). Configuration updates were also made for Soneium, including test adjustments ([#1309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1309)) and nonce updates for its Sepolia tasks ([#1316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1316)).

- **Internal Process & Upgrade Preparation:** Efforts were made to improve internal tooling and prepare for future protocol versions. Work began on a safer safes template to enhance deployment security ([#1298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1298)). In preparation for "Upgrade 18," a new template was proposed ([#1313](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1313)), and a task was added to support new game types for the alphanet ([#1314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1314)). The `CODEOWNERS` file was also updated to streamline review processes for the Sepolia task directory ([#1306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1306)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The month saw the resolution of a major feature epic around ZK challenges, while new and existing issues highlighted key pain points for node operators.

- **Closed Issues:** A significant cluster of issues related to ZK proof generation and challenger support was closed. Key decisions were made to use the succinct proposer for proof generation ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18319)) and to officially support ZK game types within `op-challenger` ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18321), [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18322)). This was followed by the closure of several implementation issues for the `challenger` module, including improvements to test coverage, bond handling, and registry interactions ([#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18412)-[#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18415), [#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18427)).

- **New & Active Issues:** Several critical issues for node operators saw active discussion. A bug causing `op-node` to get stuck in EL sync mode after a restart ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18468)) was reported as a blocker for Base Mainnet operators, with a temporary workaround being shared. Another user reported encountering an "invalid block signature" error during testnet deployment ([#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/17448)). Additionally, a long-standing issue where Proxyd can serve stale `unsafe` block data ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/501)) was revisited, with a developer committing to address it in early January.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both feature development and issue triage. The coordinated closure of numerous issues related to the `op-challenger` and ZK games indicates a focused team effort to complete a major feature epic. On the issue front, community and team interaction proved valuable. For instance, the `op-node` sync issue ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18468)) saw a user report the problem, another confirm it, and a team member provide a temporary solution, demonstrating a responsive feedback loop. The discussion around the Proxyd bug ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/501)) also highlighted transparent planning, with a developer publicly scheduling the work for their next on-call rotation.
