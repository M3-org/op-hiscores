# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
June was a month of focused execution on Superchain infrastructure, balancing preparations for future upgrades with critical stability improvements. Significant progress was made in preparing Mode and Metal Mainnets for permissioned fault proofs and readying U16 mainnet tasks. The team also dedicated substantial effort to enhancing the CI/CD pipeline, addressing flakiness, and improving developer tooling, which culminated in the closure of a large volume of related issues. Concurrently, performance bottlenecks in core components like `op-batcher`, `op-node`, and `op-geth` were actively investigated, highlighting a strong commitment to the operational health and reliability of the Superchain.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on upgrades, bug fixes, and significant refactoring to improve system maintainability and developer experience.

-   **Superchain Upgrade Preparations:**
    -   Groundwork was laid to transition Mode and Metal Mainnet to permissioned fault proofs, with initial files and tasks created to facilitate the upgrade ([#955], [#956]).
    -   Preparations for U16 mainnet tasks were advanced, including new configurations for enabling/removing the DPM and upgrading the OPCM for chains like op-ink, soneium, uni, and base ([#1047]).
    -   Sepolia's OPCM and Standard Validator addresses were updated to `rc.8` to align with the latest `op-contracts` release candidate ([#1095]).
    -   Validation entries for Op, Ink, and Unichain upgrades were enhanced with more detailed contract and storage information ([#1104], [#1107]).

-   **Critical Bug Fixes & Nonce Management:**
    -   Several nonce-related issues were resolved, including fixes for Base Sepolia ([#1061]) and a nonce bump issue affecting Base L1PAO and Ops Safe transactions ([#1102]).
    -   A bug in the `sim-sequence` script was fixed by adding an environment flag to control override checks, improving simulation reliability ([#1051]).
    -   Local execution errors were resolved by correcting how `approve` and `execute` commands in `justfiles` handle `signer_args` ([#1103]).

-   **CI/CD and Tooling Enhancements:**
    -   The CI pipeline was optimized by removing completed simulations for Mode and Metal ([#1098]) and increasing the timeout for long-running jobs in CircleCI ([#1099]).
    -   Wallet support was briefly expanded to include Trezor ([#1089]) but was later reverted ([#1100]).

-   **Code Refactoring and Maintainability:**
    -   A significant refactoring of `MultisigTask.sol` removed child state variables, streamlining the contract by passing state directly through functions to improve clarity and maintainability ([#1085]).
    -   A parent multisig was refactored to be named "root safe" for better clarity ([#1080]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The month saw a major effort to resolve outstanding issues, particularly around tooling and CI, alongside the emergence of new performance-related investigations.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    A large number of issues were closed, reflecting a concerted push to finalize tooling improvements and clean up the backlog. Key themes include:
    -   **CI/CD & Automation:** Numerous issues were resolved to improve CI performance, automate task execution ([#337]), support "stacked" proposals ([#342]), and enhance validation checks ([#679]). The spike to explore CI SLAs was also concluded, with a decision not to implement them at this time ([#16437]).
    -   **Testing & Tooling:** Flashblocks acceptance tests were completed ([#354]), and the ability to modify predeploys in Supersim was added ([#393]).
    -   **Developer Experience:** Issues related to documentation ([#1508]), user experience for nonce overrides ([#770]), and scripting path corrections ([#548], [#600]) were addressed.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    Discussions this month centered on performance, stability, and future development paths.
    -   **Performance & Stability:** New investigations were opened into `op-batcher` memory consumption during L1 congestion ([#16537], [#16572]). Active discussions continued around abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` v1.101511.0 ([#613]), stuck goroutines in `op-node` ([#16332]), and event handling and reset behavior in `op-supervisor` ([#16335], [#16315]).
    -   **Future Work & Design:** Planning began for enabling flashblocks on op-sepolia ([#16496]). A notable discussion emerged around enabling a "trivial interop mode" for `op-node` to simplify operations for single-chain operators ([#16519]).
    -   **Tooling & Automation:** A long-running discussion on automating release pipelines and changelog generation using tools like GoReleaser and `git-cliff` continued, with a focus on creating a one-click solution ([#16097]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was strong this month, particularly around improving internal processes and addressing user-reported stability issues.

-   The discussions around CI flakiness and potential SLAs ([#16271], [#16437]) were highly collaborative, with detailed proposals and feedback from multiple team members, indicating a collective focus on improving developer productivity.
-   User-reported issues, such as the high CPU usage in `op-geth` ([#613]) and stuck goroutines in `op-node` ([#16332]), saw active engagement from the community and prompt diagnostic support from maintainers.
-   The distinction between `supersim` and Kurtosis devnets was clarified in issue discussions ([#399]), helping developers choose the right tool for their needs. The large-scale closure of issues on June 26th suggests a coordinated team effort to reduce technical debt and finalize a cycle of tooling enhancements.
