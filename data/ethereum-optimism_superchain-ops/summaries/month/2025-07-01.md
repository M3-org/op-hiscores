# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of execution and refinement for the Superchain. The primary focus was on finalizing the U16 network upgrade, with development shifting from preparation to execution. Numerous bug fixes, configuration updates, and validation corrections culminated in the successful on-chain execution of several key U16 tasks. Concurrently, the team invested heavily in operational maturity by overhauling the Security Council rehearsal system, preparing new playbooks for the next cohort of signers. This dual focus on immediate upgrade delivery and long-term operational excellence defined the month's progress.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on the U16 upgrade, security operations, and core tooling enhancements.

### U16 Upgrade Finalization and Execution
The team dedicated significant effort to ensuring a smooth U16 upgrade, moving from preparation to final execution.
- **Preparation:** Early in the month, state diffs were generated for Op & Ink, Soneium, and Unichain to prepare for the upgrade ([#1110], [#1111], [#1112]).
- **Bug Fixes:** A series of critical bug fixes were implemented for U16 configurations on both Sepolia and mainnet. This included resolving issues in `config.toml` files ([#1114]), adding state overrides for simulation ([#1115]), and correcting configurations for DPM/DGM features ([#1113], [#1123], [#1127]).
- **Validation & Documentation:** Accuracy was a key focus, with updates to READMEs ([#1134]), validation files for `approvedHashes` ([#1135]), and corrections to `AnchorStateRegistry` storage interpretation ([#1141]).
- **Execution:** By the end of the month, U16 tasks 016-021 were successfully moved from "READY TO SIGN" ([#1142]) to "EXECUTED," with on-chain transaction hashes recorded ([#1148]).
- **Speedrun Templates:** To support future upgrades, bug fixes were introduced to allow speedrun templates to handle multiple OPCM targets and use historical prestates, preventing creation collisions ([#1146], [#1147]).

### Security Council Rehearsal System Overhaul
Significant progress was made in maturing the Security Council's operational readiness.
- **Integration & Enhancement:** Rehearsals were integrated into the new `superchain-ops` system ([#1121]), and old CI configurations were streamlined ([#1130]). The system was enhanced with new templates for removing signers and performing nested upgrades ([#1128], [#1132]).
- **Playbook Development:** New playbooks and documentation were created for the July 2025 Cohort B signers, covering welcome procedures, signer removal, and nested upgrades ([#1140], [#1153], [#1154]).

### Core Tooling and Contract Refactoring
The underlying tooling for managing multisig operations and upgrades saw substantial improvements.
- **`MultisigTask` Refinements:** The `MultisigTask` contract was heavily refactored to improve modularity by moving Gnosis Safe logic into a library ([#1092]), enhancing readability ([#1090], [#1129]), and simplifying the contract by removing the `root address` state variable ([#1149]). A key bug was fixed to ensure configuration overrides are applied early, improving the developer workflow ([#1151]).
- **Superchain Configuration:** A new template was added to unpause the SuperchainConfig post-U16, streamlining future administrative tasks ([#1137]).
- **Performance:** A small but notable performance improvement was made in state diff decoding by optimizing `AccountAccessParser.sol` ([#1138]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on closing out legacy problems related to network stability and testing, while opening new issues for future infrastructure work.

### Closed Issues
A significant number of issues were resolved, hardening the system and cleaning up the backlog.
- **Network Stability & Infrastructure:** Several long-standing issues concerning sequencer stability, recovery from sequence window expiration, and node startup problems were closed ([#11228], [#12240], [#15411]). Key progress was made on the flashblocks rollout, with the closure of issues related to RPC configuration, non-public deployment, and the websocket-proxy deployment ([#16544], [#16496], [#16686]).
- **Testing & Validation:** The team resolved issues related to acceptance test reliability ([#16378]), failures from an `op-geth` version bump ([#16731]), and the porting of several tests to the `devstack` environment ([#413], [#415]).
- **Tooling & Configuration:** An issue regarding CrossL2Inbox configuration was closed, as improvements in `op-deployer` tooling mitigated the original risk ([#15765]). An issue to improve the logger utility was also closed, with the conclusion that existing functionality is sufficient ([#15139]).

### New & Active Issues
Discussions this month highlighted key areas for future development and ongoing challenges.
- **Infrastructure Migration:** A new issue was opened to track the migration from Etherscan to Blockscout for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia block explorers, representing a significant upcoming infrastructure project ([#1131]).
- **Flashblocks Monitoring:** A critical active discussion focuses on establishing comprehensive monitoring and alerting for flashblocks ahead of its full enablement, defining key metrics for peer counts, transaction processing, and component health ([#16388]).
- **Test Environment Alignment:** An important issue was raised to align the acceptance test network topology with the production environment, which is crucial for catching configuration-related bugs before they reach production ([#16746]).
- **Potential Blockers:** An effort to add a semgrep rule for code style was blocked by a disabled GitHub Actions configuration ([#15115]), highlighting how repository settings can impact development velocity.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
While the reports do not indicate a large number of external contributions, they reveal strong internal collaboration among the core team. Detailed technical discussions on active issues like the `op-sync-tester` ([#16452]), interop stress testing ([#15285]), and flashblocks monitoring ([#16388]) show multiple team members engaging to solve complex problems.

A positive example of community interaction was seen when a code duplication issue in `op-batcher` was pointed out by a user ([#16677]), who was then invited to submit a pull request to fix it. This demonstrates a welcoming and responsive approach to external feedback. The detailed checklists and planning evident in issues like the Fault Proof creator contract changes ([#15789]) further underscore a culture of thorough and collaborative engineering.
