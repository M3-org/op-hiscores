      "author": "0xChin",
      "number": 1323,
      "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\n  This PR fixes an issue where CI validation was only checking the first signer's (e.g., Foundation) message hash against VALIDATION.md, while silently ignoring other signers (e.g., Security Council) for nested safe tasks.\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\n\r\n  For nested multisig tasks (e.g., PAO with Foundation and Security Council as child safes), the simulation only runs through one child safe path. Previously, only that simulated child's dataToSign was returned and validated against VALIDATION.md. Other sibling safes' hashes were never computed or validated, meaning incorrect hashes in VALIDATION.md would go undetected.\r\n\r\n **Solution**\r\n\r\n  1. Return `dataToSign` for ALL sibling child safes - Changed return type from bytes memory to bytes[] memory to support multiple signers\r\n  2. Store sibling nonces before execution - Added `_siblingNonces` mapping to capture original nonces before they get incremented during simulation. This is necessary because `_collectAllSiblingDataToSign` runs after execution when nonces have already changed.\r\n  3. New `_collectAllSiblingDataToSign` function - Iterates over all contract owners of the root safe and generates dataToSign for each one using their stored pre-execution nonce\r\n  4. Validate ALL hashes in TaskManager - Modified `executeTask` to loop through all dataToSign entries and validate each against `VALIDATION.md`\r\n\r\n**Files Changed**\r\n\r\n  - `src/tasks/MultisigTask.sol` - Core logic for collecting all sibling dataToSign\r\n  - `src/tasks/TaskManager.sol` - Validation loop for all hashes\r\n  - `test/tasks/TaskManager.t.sol` - New test for nested safe validation\r\n\r\n **Tests**\r\n\r\n  Added `testExecuteViaTaskManager_NestedSafe` which validates that:\r\n  - Nested safe tasks return 2 dataToSign entries (Foundation + Council)\r\n  - Both hashes match expected values from `VALIDATION.md`",
