Readme and output stress the importance of checking a normalized state diff against an audit report, but I gather we don't have these any more. \n\n3. User is encouraged to use op-txverify, but I'm not clear that is a necessary step or not?\n\n4. How to use HD_PATH env variable does not seem to be documented. \n\n5. These links in the validation.md\n\n```md\n3. [Verifying the transaction input](#understanding-task-calldata)\n4. [Verifying the state changes](#task-state-changes)\n```\n\nare broken. \n\n6. I get a tenderly link to follow, but I don't know what to do with the simulation output since we don't validate the state diff any more.",

Their primary impact was architecting the Optimism marketing site's React migration by creating the central tracking issue (#937) and breaking down the project into numerous foundational tasks, including monorepo setup, CI/CD, and Storybook configuration (#938-#941). They also identified and created several smaller, targeted UI improvements across various ecosystem sites, such as font updates and security enhancements, which have since been closed."
