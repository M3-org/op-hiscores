# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of focused refinement and strategic decision-making for the Community Hub and related Optimism infrastructure. Development centered on improving documentation, enhancing the test suite, and making key architectural choices for sequencer operations. A significant effort was made to triage the issue backlog, closing numerous long-standing issues related to sequencer stability and `flashblocks` deployment to better focus engineering efforts. This period of consolidation also saw the initiation of a key ecosystem migration from Etherscan to Blockscout and continued investigation into complex, intermittent bugs within the transaction pool.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work completed this month primarily involved documentation enhancements and minor user-facing updates, reflecting a focus on clarity and maintenance.

- **Documentation and UI/UX Improvements:** Several updates were made to improve the clarity and accuracy of project resources. This included adding new documentation for Superstacks allocation to clarify OP Token distribution ([#1167](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1167)), removing an outdated airdrop banner ([#1168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1168)), and cleaning up deprecated trackers and broken links ([#1170](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1170), [#1171](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1171)). A pull request was also opened to correct various typos ([#1172](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1172)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The majority of activity in July revolved around issue management, with a strong emphasis on closing stale issues and clarifying priorities for future work.

- **Closed Issues:** A significant cleanup of the issue backlog provided clarity on project direction.
    - **Sequencer Infrastructure & Stability:** Strategic decisions were made to streamline sequencer infrastructure. Discussions concluded on skipping NVMe node deployment for now ([#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16689)) and keeping `flashblocks` components in the same namespace as other sequencer components to simplify efforts ([#16690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16690)). Several older issues concerning sequencer halting ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/12240)) and recovery from sequence window expiration ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/11228)) were also closed.
    - **Flashblocks Prioritization:** The team deprioritized enabling `flashblocks` on Sunnyside sequencers to focus on stabilizing the feature on OP Labs Sepolia infrastructure first ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16688)). Other related configuration issues were also closed in favor of new, more focused tasks ([#16544](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16544), [#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16496)).
    - **Test Suite & Code Health:** The effort to port the `TestChainFork` to devstack was successfully completed, improving the acceptance test suite ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/413)). An issue regarding deprecated NPM packages was also resolved, confirming they are no longer being updated ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/13459)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Block Explorer Migration:** A new initiative was started to migrate all Etherscan links to Blockscout for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia ([#1169](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1169), [#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1696]), with a pull request already in review.
    - **Ongoing Investigations:** A challenging, flaky bug where invalid interop transactions are sometimes included in the txpool remains under active investigation ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/635)). Despite detailed logs, the issue has been difficult to reproduce consistently.
    - **Future Design:** A forward-looking discussion on designing a congestion-based builder transaction reordering mechanism ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/306)) received renewed interest, signaling potential future work in this area.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident in both active debugging and strategic planning. The investigation into the flaky txpool issue ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/635)) saw detailed back-and-forth between contributors @pcw109550 and @axelKingsley. The Blockscout migration effort ([#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1696)) also showed active collaboration between multiple team members. Furthermore, the design discussion for transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/306)) attracted a new community member, `moonfury-ops`, expressing interest in contributing to the design. The significant triage activity, led by maintainers, demonstrates a healthy process of backlog grooming and priority alignment within the project.
