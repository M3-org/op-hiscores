# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
November's development activity focused on improving the stability and accuracy of the project. Key efforts included enhancing the developer experience by fixing documentation and resolving a persistent flaky test, thereby improving the reliability of the test suite. Additionally, important discussions continued around core components like the `op-batcher`, with a focus on ensuring that technical specifications accurately reflect the current implementation, particularly concerning alternative data availability (altDA).

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on maintenance and refinement rather than new features.

- **Documentation Improvements:** A pull request ([#1196](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1196)) was opened to fix a broken link within the project's documentation, ensuring developers have access to accurate information.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on improving test stability and clarifying specifications for core protocol components.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Test Suite Stability:** A long-standing flaky test, `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor`, was successfully resolved and the corresponding issue ([#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17548)) was closed. This marks an improvement in the overall stability of the continuous integration pipeline.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were opened based on the provided reports.
  - An important discussion continued in issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17796) regarding the `op-batcher`'s interaction with alternative data availability (altDA). The conversation highlighted a potential discrepancy between the specification and the implementation concerning `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE`. A suggestion was made to update the specification document to align with the current, implemented logic.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the ongoing technical discussions aimed at maintaining specification accuracy. The conversation on issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17796) involved multiple contributors working together to determine the best path forward for aligning the `op-batcher`'s specification with its implementation, demonstrating a proactive approach to maintaining project quality.
