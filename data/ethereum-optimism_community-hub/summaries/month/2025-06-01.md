# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
June was a month of two distinct halves, beginning with focused documentation improvements and culminating in a major push to enhance developer tooling. The most significant achievement was the series of upgrades to the Superchain-Ops workflow, which streamlined task automation, simulation, and CI efficiency, leading to the closure of numerous long-standing developer experience issues. Concurrently, the project invested heavily in clarifying community governance, with comprehensive content overhauls for the Citizen House and Token House. Ongoing efforts to improve system stability were also prominent, with tangible progress made in mitigating CI flakiness and investigating critical component behaviors like the `op-supervisor` and `op-geth`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This section details the concrete work completed in June, categorized by focus area.

### Superchain-Ops Workflow Enhancements
A significant effort was dedicated to improving the Superchain-Ops tooling, resulting in a more efficient and developer-friendly workflow.
- **Stacked Simulations:** Implemented support for "stacked" proposals, allowing for the sequential simulation and execution of tasks with incrementing nonces. This addresses key CI efficiency and task scheduling challenges ([#342], [#337]).
- **CI & Tooling Performance:** CI job performance was improved by optimizing chain discovery and address registry lookups ([#648]). The `SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER` functionality was refined for better interactive simulations ([#448]), and the `AccountAccessParser` was enhanced to output state diffs in a more readable Markdown format ([#777]).
- **Mainnet Integration:** Task fetching was updated to use the mainnet task directory, and various paths were corrected to ensure consistency with production environments and monorepo integration tests ([#547], [#600], [#548]).

### Governance and Community Documentation
Clarity and accessibility of governance documentation were a major focus, with extensive updates across the community hub.
- **Citizen House Overhaul:** The Citizen House documentation received a comprehensive refresh, including updates to the overview, glossary, eligibility requirements, selection process, and FAQs ([#1152], [#1161]). A bug affecting the display of eligible chains and applications on the governance site was also fixed ([#1159]).
- **General Content Refinements:** Copy was updated across several key pages to improve clarity, including the welcome overview, how-to-delegate guide, Token House overview, and grant overview ([#1156], [#1157], [#1158], [#1160]).
- **Schema and Link Fixes:** Minor but important updates included adding a `refUID` field to the citizen schema ([#1162]) and fixing various broken links ([#1150], [#1151], [#1153]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
This section summarizes the state of issues in the project, highlighting key resolutions and ongoing discussions.

### Closed Issues
A large volume of issues were closed in June, primarily centered around a single, coordinated effort to improve developer tooling.
- **Superchain-Ops & Developer Experience:** The most significant achievement was the closure of a large batch of issues related to the Superchain-Ops framework. This work resolved problems with CI automation ([#337]), stacked proposal support ([#342]), tooling refinements ([#448], [#514]), contract validation ([#636], [#654]), and pathing for mainnet tasks ([#547], [#600]).
- **CI Stability:** The investigation into CI flakiness ([#16271]) was closed after significant progress was made, including the release of a test flake report generator to monitor stability going forward.
- **Dependencies & Documentation:** A dependency issue causing import errors in `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` was resolved ([#1146]), and an issue related to an outdated testnet tutorial was closed ([#1614]).

### New & Active Issues
While few new critical issues were opened, several active discussions point to key areas of future work and ongoing challenges.
- **Release Pipeline Automation ([#16097]):** An important discussion is underway to streamline the release process for `op-node`, `op-batcher`, and other components by using tools like `GoReleaser` and `git-cliff` for automated changelog generation.
- **`op-geth` CPU Usage ([#613]):** An issue regarding abnormal CPU usage in a recent `op-geth` version remains active. While some maintainers suggest the issue is temporary and related to index rebuilding, community members report persistent high usage, prompting further investigation.
- **`op-supervisor` Hardening:** Discussions continue on improving the robustness of the `op-supervisor`, specifically around handling L1 origin validity during resets ([#16315]) and diagnosing a potential event overflow on large unsafe head gaps ([#16335]).
- **Incorrect Nonce Bug ([#623]):** A long-standing issue where `eth_getTransactionCount` returns an incorrect nonce for pending transactions continues to affect users, with community members periodically requesting updates on a fix.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
June's activity highlighted strong internal collaboration and active engagement from the wider community.
- The successful push to improve the Superchain-Ops tooling, culminating in the closure of many issues on June 26, points to a well-coordinated team effort. This was supported by internal knowledge sharing, including the creation of training sessions and Loom videos to onboard stakeholders to the new tools ([#514]).
- Active technical discussions on issues like CI flakiness ([#16271]), `op-geth` performance ([#613]), and release automation ([#16097]) demonstrate healthy collaboration between core developers (including `scharissis`, `sebastianst`, `protolambda`, and `geoknee`) and engaged community members.
- There is evidence of community members stepping up to contribute, with multiple users expressing interest in tackling developer experience improvements like reducing noisy terminal output ([#781]).
