# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development focused on enhancing protocol stability and refining core specifications. Significant progress was made in resolving critical Flashblocks connectivity issues, ensuring reliable block delivery and completing coordination with RPC providers. The team also advanced testing infrastructure by adding a specific test for the Fusaka network activation and updated the data availability footprint specification. However, a major challenge surfaced with the discovery of a Go 1.25 compatibility issue in the Cannon fault-proof system, which is now a key focus for resolution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on protocol refinement and documentation accuracy, with several important issues being closed via pull requests.

- **Protocol Specification & Testing:** Efforts were made to improve protocol correctness and test coverage. A specific test for the Fusaka (Osaka) L1 activation was implemented ([#17666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/17666)), enhancing validation for network upgrades. The data availability (DA) footprint specification was also updated to align with the latest design, now using `blobBaseFee` instead of `gasUsed` ([#800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/800)).

- **Documentation:** A minor but important correction was made to a spelling error in a `_meta.json` file, ensuring the accuracy of documentation in the `pages/connect` directory ([#1195](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1195)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month involved resolving stability problems, refining protocol implementations, and identifying a critical external dependency issue.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Stability:** A critical issue causing the `Flashblocks-websocket-proxy` to lose Flashblocks due to connectivity timeouts was resolved through upgrades to `rollup-boost` ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17856)). Related coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers to integrate a new node was also successfully completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17857)).
    - **Protocol & Testing Refinements:** Several issues were closed to advance the protocol. The v2 dispute game implementation was progressed in `OPCM.deploy` ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17257)), and a test for Fusaka activation was added ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17500)). An older issue for negative chain config testing was closed as it is no longer relevant ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/686)).
    - **Specification Updates:** The issue to update the DA footprint block limit specification was closed ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/792)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Critical Blocker: Go 1.25 Compatibility:** A significant issue is being tracked in Cannon's support for Go 1.25 ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17060)). It was confirmed that an upstream issue in Go's MIPS emulation causes all keccak hashes to be calculated incorrectly when running in Cannon. This directly impacts block hash calculations and represents a major blocker for the fault-proof system.
    - **Dispute Monitor Robustness:** An important discussion is ongoing regarding how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync RPC nodes ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17814)). The monitor currently misinterprets a lagging node as a disagreement. The discussion centers on the best method to identify and ignore results from nodes that are behind, with a proposal to use `syncStatus` for this check.
    - **Documentation Tracking:** Two new placeholder issues were created related to BEP documentation, suggesting future updates are planned ([#1193](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1193), [#1194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1194)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was centered on diagnosing and resolving complex technical issues. The discussion around Go 1.25 compatibility for Cannon ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17060)) involved detailed analysis and context sharing between several core contributors to diagnose the root cause. Similarly, the active discussion on improving the dispute monitor's handling of out-of-sync nodes ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17814)) highlights a collaborative approach to refining system robustness. The successful resolution of the Flashblocks RPC coordination ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17857)) demonstrates effective communication with external ecosystem partners.
