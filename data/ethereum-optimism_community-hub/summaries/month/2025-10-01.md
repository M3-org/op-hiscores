# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month focused on enhancing protocol stability, refining core components, and addressing critical compatibility challenges. Key achievements include resolving a significant Flashblocks issue that caused data loss and successfully coordinating with RPC providers to roll out a new node. Progress was also made in testing and specifications, with the closure of long-standing validation issues. However, the project faces a notable blocker with Go 1.25 compatibility in Cannon, which is actively being investigated, alongside important discussions on improving the reliability of the dispute monitoring system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on incremental improvements to documentation, specifications, and testing infrastructure.

- **Documentation and Specifications:** A minor documentation correction was made to improve accuracy ([#1195](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1195)). More significantly, the Data Availability (DA) footprint block limit specification was updated to use `blobBaseFee` instead of `gasUsed`, reflecting the latest design (closed issue [#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/792) via PR #800).

- **Testing and Validation:** The project's testing suite was enhanced with the addition of a specific test for Fusaka (Osaka) activation on L1, closing issue [#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17500) via PR [#17666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/17666).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on resolving stability problems and tackling complex, ongoing technical discussions.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Stability:** A critical issue causing the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` to lose Flashblocks due to connectivity and timeout problems was resolved through upgrades with `rollup-boost` ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17856)).
    - **RPC Provider Coordination:** Efforts to coordinate with Flashblocks RPC providers for a new node were successfully completed, with most providers confirming integration ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17857)).
    - **Testing & Implementation:** An old issue regarding negative testing for chain configuration was closed as it was no longer relevant ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/686)). An issue related to using the v2 dispute game implementation was also closed ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17257)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Blocker: Go 1.25 Compatibility in Cannon:** A major ongoing issue is the incompatibility of Cannon with Go 1.25 ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17060)). It has been confirmed that this bug causes all keccak hashes to be calculated incorrectly within the emulated MIPS environment, impacting block hashes. The team is tracking an upstream Go issue (golang/go#74998) for a resolution.
    - **Dispute Monitor Reliability:** An important discussion is active on how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync RPC nodes ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17814)). The monitor currently flags false disagreements when one node is lagging. The proposed solution is to use the node's `syncStatus` to identify and ignore results from nodes that are behind.
    - **BEP Documentation:** Two new placeholder issues ([#1193](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1193), [#1194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1194)) were created, pointing towards upcoming work on BEP (Bedrock Enhancement Proposal) documentation.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was characterized by focused, in-depth problem-solving on complex technical issues. The discussion around Go 1.25 compatibility in Cannon ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17060)) involved multiple team members (@pauldowman, @ajsutton, @sebastianst) working together to diagnose the root cause and its impact on Optimism. Similarly, the active debate on improving the dispute monitor's logic ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17814)) highlights a collaborative effort to enhance the robustness of the system. The successful coordination with external RPC providers ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17857)) demonstrates effective ecosystem-wide communication.
