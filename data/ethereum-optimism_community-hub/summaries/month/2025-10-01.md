# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's efforts focused on core infrastructure stability and testing. A critical compatibility issue was identified in Cannon's support for Go 1.25, which causes incorrect hash calculations and is being treated as a blocker. This diagnostic work ran parallel to progress in the project's testing suite, where a key test for the Fusaka L1 activation was successfully implemented and closed. The month's activity underscores a commitment to maintaining the foundational security and reliability of the protocol.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the available data, development work centered on enhancing the protocol's test coverage.

- **Protocol Testing:** A specific test for the Fusaka (Osaka) activation on L1 was completed and merged via PR [#17666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/17666), resolving a long-standing issue ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17500)). This improves validation for protocol upgrades.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month involved resolving legacy test-related tasks while triaging a significant new blocker and preparing for future documentation work.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Testing & Validation:** Two issues were closed. The "Fusaka activation test" ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17500)) was completed. An older issue regarding negative testing for chain configurations ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/686)) was closed as it was no longer relevant due to a new report-based validation approach.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Cannon Go 1.25 Blocker:** The most significant active discussion is on issue [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17060), concerning Go 1.25 compatibility. It was confirmed that running Cannon with Go 1.25 results in incorrect keccak hashes, which impacts block hash calculations. The problem is linked to an upstream Go issue ([golang/go/issues/74998](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/74998)) affecting emulated MIPS hardware and is considered a blocker.
  - **BEP Documentation:** Two new issues ([#1193](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1193), [#1194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1194)) were opened referencing `BEPs/BEP2.md`, signaling upcoming work on documentation.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the focused effort to diagnose the critical Go 1.25 compatibility issue in Cannon ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17060)). Contributors @pauldowman, @ajsutton, and @sebastianst engaged in a detailed discussion to confirm the issue's impact on Optimism, link it to an upstream dependency, and provide a detailed diagnosis. This highlights the team's active problem-solving on complex, low-level bugs essential to the stack's integrity.
