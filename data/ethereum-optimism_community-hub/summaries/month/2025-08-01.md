# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
August was a month of refinement and strategic planning. Development focused on maintenance and cleanup, particularly within the community hub's documentation and the project's testing frameworks. Key issues related to proof system acceptance testing were closed, marking significant progress in validating interop chain functionality. The team also made decisive moves to deprioritize older initiatives, such as the event system and certain testing tools like Kurtosis, in favor of focusing resources on upcoming priorities. Notably, planning for a major migration to a "Forge Deployer" gained momentum, with community members actively coordinating to tackle this significant piece of future work.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Concrete development work this month centered on improving the content and presentation of the community hub. There were no major new features or bug fixes merged.

-   **Documentation and Content Cleanup:** Several pull requests streamlined the contributor-facing documentation. Outdated pages for ambassador and translator contribution paths were removed ([#1174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1174), [#1175](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1175), [#1176](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1176)). Content was also updated to clarify Citizens' House eligibility ([#1180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1180)) and refresh the techNERD ([#1177](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1177)) and govNERDS ([#1181](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1181)) pages.

-   **Visual and Asset Updates:** Minor visual enhancements were made, including updates to font files ([#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1182)) and a new favicon for the site ([#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1183)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month was characterized by the closure of long-standing tasks and active planning for future development efforts. No new issues were opened during this period.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Proof System & Testing:** A significant milestone was reached with the closure of issues for interop proof system acceptance testing ([#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/15946), [#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/15948)), indicating the validation work is complete.
    -   **Strategic Deprioritization:** Several issues were closed as the work was deemed no longer necessary or was superseded by new strategies. This includes cleanup of the event system ([#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17001), [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16874)), adding challenger support to `op-up` ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17005)), and a decision to favor Sysgo over Kurtosis for network testing ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/375)).
    -   **Housekeeping:** A postmortem for a scalar fix was closed ([#17012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17012)), and an issue regarding missing test logs was resolved ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17151)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Forge Deployer Migration:** The most significant active discussion revolves around migrating to a "Forge Deployer" ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17213)). This has spurred the creation of several sub-tasks for converting deployment and verification logic ([#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17214) - [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17218)), representing a major upcoming refactoring effort.
    -   **Testing Scope & Flashblocks:** Discussions continued on refining the scope of validation tests for chain configuration ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/686]). The sync test issue was reopened to include more Hardfork transition scenarios ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16703)). Progress was also noted on creating new alerts for flashblocks monitoring ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16867), [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16868)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly visible in issue discussions, particularly in planning for future work.

-   The "Forge Deployer" migration ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17213)) stands out as a prime example of community engagement. User `tooshiNoko` proactively offered to take ownership of several large tasks, prompting coordination among team members to organize the effort and prevent overlapping work.
-   In issue [#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/13502), a user confirmed that a community-suggested fix resolved their `op-proposer` configuration problem, demonstrating effective peer-to-peer support.
-   Internal team collaboration was evident in the planning for validation testing ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/686)), where team members scheduled discussions to review and define the scope of future tests.
