# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December's efforts were characterized by crucial maintenance and strategic architectural discussions shaping the future of the Superchain. A key security vulnerability in Next.js was promptly addressed, reinforcing the project's commitment to security. Meanwhile, significant conversations advanced the Superchain's interoperability specification, particularly around simplifying transaction handling in a ZK-proof context. These discussions, combined with a focus on resolving persistent node synchronization and developer tooling issues, highlight a month of foundational work and forward-looking planning.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Development work this month focused on ensuring the stability and security of the existing codebase.

- **Security and Maintenance:** A critical security vulnerability was patched through an upgrade of Next.js to version 14.2.35 ([#1198](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1198)). General code quality was also improved with a minor linting fix ([#1199](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1199)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue tracking this month was dominated by important ongoing discussions rather than a high volume of new or closed issues.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Chain Upgrade Documentation:** An important issue was closed regarding the documentation of the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for standard chain upgrades ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18095)). This resolution ensures that the necessary information is available to the documentation team, clarifying a key requirement for ecosystem developers.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Superchain Architecture:** Discussions were active on core Superchain components. A key conversation on [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18574) explored simplifying the interop specification by removing replacement transactions, noting their limited value in a ZK dispute system. Concurrently, issue [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18621) addressed the need to adapt proof action testing for the Supernode architecture, emphasizing testing the `op-challenger` against a real Supernode.
    - **Node Operation & Developer Experience:** Challenges with node stability and developer tooling were prominent topics. The discussion in [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18581) highlighted persistent "missing trie node" errors faced by node operators, prompting questions about the best path forward with OP-GETH or Reth. In parallel, a community-driven solution for fixing project-relative pathing issues in Foundry was confirmed in [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/10202).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was evident in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. The architectural debates around interoperability ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18574)) and proof testing ([#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18621)) show deep involvement from core contributors in shaping the project's future. Furthermore, community collaboration was highlighted in [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/10202), where one user's suggestion successfully resolved another's tooling problem, demonstrating a healthy, supportive ecosystem. The active troubleshooting by users on issues like node synchronization ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18581)) underscores the community's role in identifying and resolving practical challenges.
