# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September was a month of deep infrastructure work and documentation enhancement. Significant progress was made in deploying Flashblocks across the network, with several key configuration and enablement tasks completed or actively underway. Preparations for the Fusaka hardfork were also a major focus, particularly ensuring `op-node` compatibility. On the community-facing side, the documentation was notably improved with the addition of a Superchain revenue explainer. Concurrently, the team continued to tackle persistent challenges, including test flakiness and protocol-level bugs, reflecting a commitment to system stability and reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development this month centered on improving documentation and user experience within the community hub.

- **Superchain Documentation & UX:** A significant effort was made to enhance the `op-token` section. A new Superchain revenue explainer was added to provide clarity on the ecosystem's economic model ([#1187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1187)). This was supported by several metadata updates to improve navigation ([#1188](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1188), [#1189](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1189)), a fix for a sidebar display bug ([#1190](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1190)), and minor content refinements ([#1186](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1186), [#1191](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1191), [#1192](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1192)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue tracking this month was dominated by infrastructure rollouts, protocol upgrades, and stability improvements.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Infrastructure & Tooling:** Key infrastructure tasks were completed, including the enablement of flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers ([#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16761)) and `proxyd` preparations for the Fusaka L1 activation ([#467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/467)). Improvements to `op-acceptor` were also finalized, adding configuration logging and optimizing package parallelism ([#461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/461), [#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/462)).
    - **Strategic Deprioritization:** The integration of `op-test-sequencer` with Kurtosis was closed after a decision to move away from the Kurtosis environment ([#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/15265)).
    - **Housekeeping:** A Forge Deployer CLI wrapper issue was closed ([#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17214)), and an issue for a dispute game creator pattern refactor was closed as a duplicate ([#17436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17436)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Rollout:** A major ongoing effort is the network-wide deployment of Flashblocks. A new issue was opened to track its enablement on a mainnet sequencer ([#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17317)), while active discussions continued on deploying components like `rollup-boost` ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16759)), `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` ([#16763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16763)), and `flashblocks-rpc` ([#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16764)).
    - **Fusaka Compatibility:** A critical discussion is underway to ensure `op-node` is compatible with the upcoming Fusaka hardfork, specifically concerning the derivation pipeline and handling of excess blob gas per EIP-789 ([#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17493)).
    - **Test Stability:** A persistent flaky test, `TestPreNoInbox` in `op-acceptance-tests`, remains an active concern ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17298)). A previous fix was found to be ineffective, indicating further investigation is required to stabilize the CI pipeline.
    - **Protocol Bugs & Improvements:** A bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites defaults with zero values is being investigated, with potential solutions proposed ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17308)). Meanwhile, the "head block is not reachable" error during `op-geth` initialization continues to be reported ([#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/420)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was characterized by focused, in-depth technical discussions on core infrastructure. The series of interconnected issues related to the Flashblocks deployment ([#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17317), [#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16759), [#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16761)) demonstrates a highly coordinated effort among team members to execute a complex, multi-stage rollout. Similarly, the proactive discussion around Fusaka compatibility ([#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17493)) highlights the team's forward-looking approach to protocol evolution. The ongoing dialogue to resolve persistent issues like test flakiness ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17298)) and protocol bugs ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17308)) underscores a collective commitment to maintaining a high-quality and reliable codebase.
