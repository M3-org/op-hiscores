# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by strategic decision-making and significant housekeeping. Key infrastructure choices were made regarding sequencer components, deprioritizing immediate NVMe deployment and flashblocks on Sunnyside to focus on core stability. The team enhanced the test suite by successfully porting the `TestChainFork` to devstack and made progress on migrating Etherscan links to Blockscout. A major effort was also undertaken to close numerous stale or resolved issues, cleaning up the project backlog. A persistent, flaky test involving invalid transaction inclusion in the txpool remains a key challenge under active investigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work completed this week focused on improving documentation and user interface clarity.

*   **Documentation & UI Updates**
    *   New documentation was added to clarify Superstacks allocation, providing better insight into OP Token distribution for the community ([#1167](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1167)).
    *   An outdated airdrop banner was removed from the theme configuration, cleaning up the user interface ([#1168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1168)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a major push to clean up the issue tracker, resolving long-standing discussions and closing out old problems, while opening new tasks for ecosystem alignment.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Sequencer & Infrastructure Strategy:** Several key discussions concluded, shaping the near-term infrastructure roadmap. The team decided to defer NVMe node deployment for op-rbuilders ([#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16689)), keep flashblocks components in the same namespace as other sequencer components to simplify setup ([#16690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16690)), and deprioritize enabling flashblocks on Sunnyside in favor of stabilizing them on OP Labs Sepolia first ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16688)).
    *   **Test Suite Improvements:** A significant enhancement was made to the acceptance test suite with the successful porting of `TestChainFork` to devstack ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/413)).
    *   **Stability & Maintenance:** A large number of older issues were closed, including those related to sequencer halts on temporary errors ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/12240)), recovery from sequence window expiration ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/11228)), and node startup problems ([#15411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/15411)). An issue regarding a deprecated NPM package was also closed ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/13459)).
    *   **Code Refinement:** An issue noting duplicate code in `op-batcher` was closed, flagging it for potential future cleanup ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16677)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Block Explorer Migration:** A new issue was opened to track the migration of all OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia references from Etherscan to Blockscout ([#1169](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1169)). A related discussion ([#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1696)) indicates a pull request is already approved and awaiting merge.
    *   **Flaky Test Investigation:** The most critical active issue remains the flaky inclusion of invalid interop transactions in the txpool ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/635)). Despite detailed logs and artifacts, investigators are struggling to consistently reproduce how an invalid transaction bypasses the ingress filter, representing a potential blocker for test reliability.
    *   **Test Porting Progress:** Work to port `TestPectra` to devstack ([#416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/416)) is nearly complete, with an implementation PR identified.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted focused collaboration among team members to resolve technical challenges and improve project hygiene. The investigation into the flaky txpool test ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/635)) shows active teamwork between @pcw109550, who provided detailed diagnostics, and @axelKingsley, who is leading the investigation. Similarly, the Blockscout migration effort ([#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1696)) involved coordination between @krofax, @fainashalts, and @bradleycamacho. The concerted effort to close a large number of stale issues by maintainers like `mslipper` and `geoknee` demonstrates a strong commitment to maintaining a clean and actionable issue tracker.
