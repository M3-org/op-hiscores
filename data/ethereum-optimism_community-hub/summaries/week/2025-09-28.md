# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Weekly Report (Sep 28 - 4, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on testing, validation, and addressing a critical compatibility challenge. Progress was made in strengthening the protocol's test suite with the addition of a specific test for the Fusaka network activation. A significant ongoing investigation is focused on a Go 1.25 compatibility issue within the Cannon fault-proof system, which has been found to cause incorrect hash calculations. This issue, blocked by an upstream dependency in the Go language itself, represents a key challenge for future toolchain upgrades.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no new major features were merged, an important enhancement was made to the project's testing infrastructure.

- **Protocol Testing:** A new test for the Fusaka (Osaka) activation on L1 was implemented and merged via PR [#17666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/17666). This resolves issue [#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17500) and improves the validation process for network upgrades.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving older test-related tasks and identifying a significant new blocker.

- **Closed Issues:** The test suite was refined by closing two issues. A specific test for Fusaka activation was added ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17500)), and an older issue concerning negative testing for chain configurations was closed as it is no longer relevant to the current validation approach ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/686)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - Two new issues ([#1193](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1193), [#1194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1194)) were opened related to `BEPs/BEP2.md`, suggesting upcoming work on documentation.
    - A critical discussion is ongoing in issue [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17060) regarding Go 1.25 support for Cannon. It has been confirmed that running Cannon with Go 1.25 results in incorrect keccak hashes, which breaks essential functions like block hash calculation. The problem is tracked by an upstream Go issue (`golang/go/issues/74998`) and currently blocks the project from upgrading to Go 1.25.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
There was significant collaboration around diagnosing the Go 1.25 compatibility issue in Cannon ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17060)). Contributors @pauldowman, @ajsutton, and @sebastianst were actively involved in the discussion to confirm the issue's relevance, provide detailed context, and link to a full diagnosis of the hashing problem. This collaborative effort is crucial for navigating a complex issue dependent on an external project.
