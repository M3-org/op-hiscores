# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on maintenance and deep architectural discussions. A critical security patch was applied by upgrading Next.js, reinforcing the project's security posture. Meanwhile, significant progress was made in key design discussions, particularly around simplifying the interop transaction mechanism by potentially removing an extra deposit transaction for proofs. Conversations also advanced on strategies for testing with Supernodes and troubleshooting node synchronization issues within the community.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this period focused on security and code quality improvements.

*   **Security & Maintenance:** A critical security vulnerability was addressed by upgrading Next.js to version 14.2.35 ([#1198](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1198)). A minor linting issue was also resolved by updating the project's dictionary, ensuring continued code consistency ([#1199](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1199)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Discussions this week tackled core protocol design, testing strategies, and user support, while one documentation task was completed.

*   **Closed Issues:** An issue was closed confirming that the documentation for the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement has been delivered to the docs team, clarifying upgrade procedures ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18095)).

*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, but several active discussions are shaping future development:
    *   **Interop Transaction Simplification:** A key discussion in [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18574) is moving toward a consensus to simplify the protocol. The proposal is to eliminate the extra deposit transaction currently used for proofs, instead relying on the Supernode to generate the necessary data. This could streamline the interop mechanism.
    *   **Supernode Testing Strategy:** In issue [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18621), contributors are exploring how to rework proofs action testing to better support and integrate Supernodes, reflecting the production environment where `op-challenger` relies on Supernode for data.
    *   **Node Synchronization Support:** Troubleshooting continues in [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18581) for users experiencing "missing trie node" errors, with maintainers providing diagnostic steps to resolve potential database corruption.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was prominent in deep technical discussions this week. Contributors `ajsutton`, `rdin777`, and `inphi` were heavily involved in debating the future of interop transactions and Supernode testing strategies. The community support dynamic was also evident, with `rdin777` actively helping a user troubleshoot node issues and `alexkeating` providing a solution that resolved a pathing issue for another contributor in [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/10202).
