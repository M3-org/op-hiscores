# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Weekly Report (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This was a quiet week for the `community-hub` repository, with no new features or bug fixes merged. Development activity was minimal, with the primary focus shifting towards discussion and future planning. A notable conversation emerged around a proposal for congestion-based builder transaction reordering, attracting interest from a potential new collaborator. The only code change proposed was a minor pull request for typo corrections.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No major technical developments were completed this week. The sole pull request opened was for minor maintenance:

*   **Documentation Maintenance:** A pull request ([#1172](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1172)) was opened to correct typos within the repository.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was light this week, with no issues being opened or closed. The focus was on an existing, significant proposal.

*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved or closed this week.
*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were created. However, there was renewed activity on Issue [#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/306), which proposes a mechanism for congestion-based builder transaction reordering. The discussion centers on tracking excess data availability (DA) usage and applying an exponential cost penalty, a concept that could potentially be tested outside the core protocol.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was focused on a single, high-impact issue. User `moonfury-ops` expressed interest in collaborating on the design for congestion-based transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/306)), signaling potential community-driven progress on this complex topic. This interaction represented the most significant collaborative activity of the week.
