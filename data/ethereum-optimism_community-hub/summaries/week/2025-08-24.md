# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by strategic refinement and planning, with a focus on prioritizing impactful work and cleaning up the backlog. While direct code contributions involved minor but important updates to community hub content and governance documentation, significant progress was made in discussions. Key decisions included deprioritizing flashblocks support in Kurtosis and several `op-up` enhancements to focus resources elsewhere. A major new initiative, the "Forge Deployer" migration, kicked off with strong community engagement, and efforts continued to improve flashblocks monitoring and expand hardfork test coverage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the content and presentation of the community hub, ensuring information is accurate and accessible for contributors and community members.

- **Governance and Community Content Updates:** Several changes were made to keep documentation current. The `govnerds.mdx` page was updated with S8 Charter information ([#1181]), and the techNERD contribution page was refreshed ([#1177]). To prevent confusion, a clarification was added to distinguish between Citizenship eligibility and grant eligibility criteria ([#1180]).
- **Visual and Asset Refinements:** The project's visual identity received minor updates, including a new favicon ([#1183]) and updated font files ([#1182]), contributing to a polished user experience on the hub.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week reflected a clear effort to focus development priorities and resolve outstanding investigations.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Strategic Deprioritization:** Several issues were closed to align with current priorities. Support for the challenger in `op-up` was deemed not worth the effort for `sysgo` ([#17005]), and an `op-up` logging cleanup was shelved pending upstream changes in `op-geth` ([#17007]). A tracking issue for "Consensus influencing event nonces" was also closed as the feature is not planned for the near future ([#13543]).
    - **Investigation & Housekeeping:** An issue regarding an "Event Call Graph" was closed as the team is moving away from that system ([#16874]). A postmortem for a scalar fix was closed after its completion ([#17012]), and an issue about missing test logs was resolved when the logs were located ([#17151]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Forge Deployer Migration:** A significant new effort to migrate to a "Forge Deployer" is underway, tracked in issue [#17213]. Multiple sub-tasks have been created and claimed by a community contributor, covering the creation of a CLI wrapper and the conversion of various deployment and verification scripts ([#17214] - [#17218]).
    - **Flashblocks Monitoring & Testing:** Progress continues on improving observability for flashblocks. Discussions indicate that work is advancing on alerts for sequencer status ([#16867]) and peer health ([#16868]). In a strategic shift, adding flashblocks support to Kurtosis has been officially deprioritized ([#16514]).
    - **Test Coverage Expansion:** The sync test issue ([#16703]) was reopened to ensure all OP Stack Hardfork transitions are adequately tested, highlighting a continued focus on protocol robustness.
    - **Configuration Bug Resolution:** A user confirmed that setting the correct `--game-type` flag resolved their `op-proposer` transaction creation failure, underscoring the importance of proper configuration ([#13502]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week saw strong evidence of active community collaboration and engagement on significant technical initiatives. The "Forge Deployer" migration stands out, with contributor `tooshiNoko` proactively offering to lead several complex implementation tasks, prompting discussion around coordinating the effort to avoid duplicate work. Additionally, the resolution of the `op-proposer` issue ([#13502]) demonstrated a healthy feedback loop between users and the development team in debugging and confirming solutions.
