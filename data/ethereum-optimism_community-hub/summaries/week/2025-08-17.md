# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Weekly Report (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on maintenance, cleanup, and strategic planning. Significant progress was made in resolving long-standing technical debt, most notably by closing key issues related to proof system acceptance testing for interop chains. The team also streamlined documentation by removing outdated contribution guides. While no new features were shipped, active discussions around improving contract verification and validation testing signal a focus on enhancing the robustness and developer experience of the core infrastructure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The sole code-related changes this week involved repository maintenance and cleanup.

- **Documentation Cleanup:** Outdated documentation files concerning contributor paths were removed to streamline the `pages/contribute` section. This included the deletion of `ambassador-req.mdx` and `translators.mdx`, with corresponding updates to the navigation metadata ([#1174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1174), [#1175](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1175), [#1176](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1176)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The focus this week was on closing out completed work and advancing discussions on future improvements. No new issues were opened.

- **Closed Issues:** Several important issues were closed, marking the completion of significant tasks:
    - **Proof System Acceptance Testing:** Issues for interop acceptance testing ([#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/15946)) and `op-challenger` acceptance tests ([#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/15948)) were closed, indicating a milestone in validating the proof system.
    - **System Maintenance:** An issue tracking the removal of events from the event system was closed ([#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17001)). Additionally, an issue regarding test target setup was closed, noting a strategic shift from Kurtosis to Sysgo for network testing ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/375)).

- **New & Active Issues:** Discussions on active issues point to upcoming development priorities:
    - **Contract Verification:** In [#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/14813), discussion continues on improving contract verification. The current plan is to leverage `forge verify-contract` once forge binary support is available, which would reduce custom code and streamline the verification process.
    - **Validation Test Planning:** A discussion is planned to review the scope of validation tests for chain configuration, as tracked in [#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/686). This follows earlier suggestions to formalize and improve the testability of TOML file parsing.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was primarily visible through strategic discussions within issues rather than through code reviews. The planning conversation in [#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/686) between `alfonso-op`, `@bitwiseguy`, and `Tess` highlights the team's coordinated effort to define the scope of future validation testing. Similarly, the ongoing dialogue in [#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/14813) shows a focus on refining core developer tooling. The week's activity reflects a period of internal alignment and planning for future work.
