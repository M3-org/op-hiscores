# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing network stability and refining core protocol components. A critical issue causing lost Flashblocks was identified and resolved, restoring a key piece of infrastructure. Significant progress was also made in coordinating with external RPC providers to adopt new configurations. Meanwhile, active discussions continued on improving the resilience of the dispute monitoring system, specifically in how it handles nodes that are out of sync.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on minor but important corrections to project documentation.

- **Documentation:** A small spelling correction was made in the `_meta.json` file to improve the accuracy of the connection documentation ([#1195](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1195)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on resolving stability problems, finalizing specifications, and debating the logic for dispute monitoring.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Stability:** A critical issue where the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` was losing Flashblocks due to connectivity and timeout problems was resolved through upgrades to `rollup-boost` ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17856)).
    - **RPC Provider Coordination:** Coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers to integrate a new RPC node was successfully completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17857)).
    - **Data Availability:** The Data Availability footprint specification was updated to use `blobBaseFee` instead of `gasUsed`, aligning it with the latest design ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/792)).
    - **Dispute Games:** An issue related to the v2 dispute game implementation in `OPCM.deploy` was closed, though it was noted a TODO remains in the code ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17257)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this week.
    - **Dispute Monitor Resilience:** A significant discussion is ongoing in `op-dispute-mon` regarding how to handle out-of-sync nodes ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17814)). The monitor currently detects false disagreements when one of its configured RPCs is lagging. The debate centers on whether to trust the highest L2 block (which could be a bad fork) or use `syncStatus` to identify and ignore results from nodes that are behind. The proposed solution leans towards using `syncStatus` to improve the monitor's accuracy.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted effective collaboration both internally and with external partners. The successful resolution of the Flashblocks RPC node integration ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17857)) demonstrates strong coordination with ecosystem RPC providers. Internally, the detailed technical discussion on the `op-dispute-mon` issue ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17814)) shows a collaborative effort to solve complex architectural problems related to protocol security and monitoring.
