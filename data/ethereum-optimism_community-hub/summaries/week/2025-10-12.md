# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the stability and reliability of core infrastructure. A critical issue causing lost Flashblocks was identified and resolved, significantly improving the stability of the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy`. This fix was complemented by successful coordination with RPC providers to adopt a new Flashblocks RPC node. Meanwhile, important discussions continued on improving the `op-dispute-mon` service to more accurately handle out-of-sync nodes, ensuring the robustness of the dispute monitoring system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on documentation accuracy and finalizing technical specifications.

- **Documentation Correction:** A minor but important spelling correction was made in the documentation's `_meta.json` file to improve clarity ([#1195](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1195)).
- **Data Availability Specification Update:** The specification for the Data Availability (DA) footprint block limit was updated to use `blobBaseFee` instead of `gasUsed`, finalizing the design and closing the related issue ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/792)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving critical stability problems and advancing discussions on monitoring logic. No new issues were opened.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Stability:** A critical bug in the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` that resulted in lost Flashblocks was resolved. The issue was traced to connectivity problems and subscriber pong timeouts and was fixed via upgrades with `rollup-boost` ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17856)).
    - **RPC Provider Coordination:** Coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers to integrate a new RPC node was successfully completed, with most providers confirming the update ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17857)).
    - **Dispute Game Implementation:** An issue regarding the use of the v2 dispute game implementation was closed, though it was noted that a remaining TODO in the code might lead to it being reopened ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17257)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Dispute Monitor Logic:** Significant discussion continued on issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17814) concerning how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes. The debate centers on whether to trust the highest L2 block or use `syncStatus` to identify and ignore nodes that are lagging, preventing false disagreement alerts. This is a key discussion for ensuring the monitor's accuracy.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted effective collaboration both internally and with external partners. The successful resolution of issue [#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17857) demonstrates strong coordination with third-party RPC providers to roll out critical infrastructure changes. Internally, the active discussion on the `op-dispute-mon` issue ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17814)) shows focused teamwork on refining the technical details of the project's monitoring and security components.
