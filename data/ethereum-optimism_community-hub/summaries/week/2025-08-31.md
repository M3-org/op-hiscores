# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on the strategic deployment and configuration of Flashblocks across the ecosystem. Significant progress was made in tracking and executing the rollout on various sequencers, including mainnet. Alongside this major infrastructure initiative, key discussions focused on resolving a critical P2P gossip configuration bug that could cause panics and on enhancing the CI testing environment by exposing more networks to the `op-sync-tester`. While no new code was merged, the activity reflects a strong focus on infrastructure hardening, bug resolution, and improving test coverage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports for this period, development was focused on planning and discussion, with no new features, bug fixes, or other code changes merged into the main branch.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Discussions this week were concentrated on infrastructure deployment, network configuration bugs, and testing improvements.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - A project management issue [#1184] related to project definition and labeling was opened and immediately closed, indicating a minor administrative task.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks Deployment:** This was the most active area. A new issue [#17317] was opened to specifically track the enablement of Flashblocks on a mainnet sequencer. Discussions on related issues show steady progress: `op-rbuilder` is now deployed and synced on sunnyside sequencers [#16761], with the next step being the deployment of `rollup-boost` [#16759]. However, the deployment of `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` [#16763] is currently blocked pending the availability of conductor websocket connections.
  - **Network Configuration & Bugs:** A significant discussion emerged in [#17308] around a bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values, leading to panics in `go-libp2p-pubsub`. A potential solution involving a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to provide valid defaults is being considered. Meanwhile, the persistent "head block is not reachable" error during `op-geth` initialization continues to be reported [#420].
  - **CI and Testing:** Work is underway to improve the `op-sync-tester` by exposing more networks within the CI environment [#454]. L2 execution layers for several chains are now exposed, with the remaining task being the exposure of an L1 beacon API.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the coordinated effort to roll out Flashblocks, with multiple issues tracking different components of the deployment and their interdependencies. The detailed technical discussions in issues like the P2P gossip bug [#17308] and the sync-tester enhancements [#454] highlight deep engagement from team members in diagnosing complex problems and improving core infrastructure. The clear identification of blockers, such as the websocket dependency for the Flashblocks proxy [#16763], demonstrates active communication and problem-solving within the team.
