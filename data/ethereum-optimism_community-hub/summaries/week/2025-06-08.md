# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Weekly Report (Jun 8 - 14, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a dual focus on enhancing community-facing resources and improving core system stability. A significant effort was dedicated to overhauling governance documentation, particularly for the Citizen House, to provide greater clarity for participants. Concurrently, major strides were made in tackling CI and test flakiness with the introduction of a new "Flakiness Report" generator, a key step toward improving developer experience and platform reliability. While no major features were shipped, the week's work strengthened the project's foundation through crucial documentation updates, bug fixes, and deep investigations into the `op-supervisor` and RPC behavior.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The majority of completed work centered on documentation and content refinement within the community hub.

- **Governance Documentation Overhaul:** A comprehensive update was performed on governance-related content. This included a bug fix for the Citizen House section on the governance site ([#1159]) and extensive content revisions for the Citizen House overview, glossary, eligibility, and FAQs ([#1152], [#1161]). Other key pages, including the general welcome, delegation guide, Token House overview, and grant overview, also received copy updates to improve clarity ([#1156], [#1157], [#1158], [#1160]).

- **Schema and Link Fixes:** To support the documentation efforts, the citizen identity schema was updated with a new `refUID` field ([#1162]). Several minor pull requests were also merged to fix broken links and make small adjustments within the Token House documentation ([#1150], [#1151], [#1153]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project saw progress on resolving dependency issues and made significant headway in diagnosing long-standing stability problems.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Dependency Management:** An issue preventing imports from `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` due to a missing `dist` directory was resolved, unblocking developers who rely on the package ([#1146]).
    - **Documentation Cleanup:** An issue regarding an outdated testnet tutorial for the deprecated L2 Output Oracle was closed, removing obsolete information ([#1614]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **CI & Test Stability:** A major focus this week was on investigating CI flakiness ([#16271]) and improving acceptance test reliability ([#16378]). The key development was the creation and release of a "Flakiness Report" generator, which aims to provide better visibility into test failures, many of which are attributed to infrastructure rather than the tests themselves.
    - **`op-supervisor` Integrity:** Discussions continued on core `op-supervisor` behavior. This included improving L1 origin validity handling to reduce complexity ([#16315]) and investigating a potential event overflow on large unsafe head gaps ([#16335]), with analysis suggesting the root cause may lie elsewhere in the event system.
    - **RPC Node Behavior:** The issue where `eth_getTransactionCount` returns an incorrect nonce for pending transactions ([#623]) remains active and received multiple requests for updates, highlighting its impact on users.
    - **Planning & Future Work:** Discussions progressed on creating a quickstart guide for the Superchain Interop environment ([#1644]) and defining the necessary changes for the Fault Proof creator contract ([#15789]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted focused collaboration on improving system health and community resources.

- The effort to diagnose and improve CI stability was spearheaded by `scharissis`, whose work on the new "Flakiness Report" ([#16271], [#16378]) provides a valuable tool for all contributors.
- Deep technical discussions on the `op-supervisor` ([#16315], [#16335]) showed close collaboration between core developers like `sebastianst` and `axelKingsley` as they work to ensure the robustness of critical protocol components.
- Community members `ntrzr` and `mukul3097` kept attention on the user-facing `eth_getTransactionCount` bug ([#623]), demonstrating active engagement in tracking and pushing for resolutions to important issues.
