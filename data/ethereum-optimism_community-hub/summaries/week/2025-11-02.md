# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity focused on improving project stability and clarity. A notable achievement was the resolution of a long-standing flaky test, which enhances the reliability of the test suite. Efforts to improve developer experience continued with a fix for a broken link in the documentation. Additionally, an important discussion progressed concerning the `op-batcher`'s handling of alternative data availability, revealing a need to update the Optimism specs for better alignment with the current codebase.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on maintenance and documentation improvements to enhance the developer experience.

- **Documentation Maintenance:** A pull request ([#1196](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1196)) was opened to fix a broken link within the project's documentation, ensuring resources remain accurate and accessible for builders.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on improving test suite health and clarifying protocol behavior.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Test Suite Stability:** A flaky test, `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor`, was formally closed in issue [#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17548). The issue was resolved as the test is no longer appearing in frequent failure reports, contributing to a more reliable continuous integration pipeline.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were opened this week.
  - Discussion continued in issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17796) regarding the `op-batcher`'s max frame size when using alternative data availability. The conversation suggests that while the behavior may have been addressed in a previous pull request, the official Optimism specification might be misleading. The proposed next step is to update the spec to reflect the current implementation, highlighting a focus on aligning documentation with core protocol logic.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was centered on clarifying protocol specifications and improving test stability. The ongoing discussion in issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17796) highlights the community's effort to ensure the Optimism specs accurately reflect the `op-batcher`'s implementation, preventing potential confusion for developers. The resolution of a flaky test and the submission of a documentation fix demonstrate a continued focus on maintaining a high-quality and stable codebase.
