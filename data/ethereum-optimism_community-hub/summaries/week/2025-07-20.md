## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on documentation cleanup and resolving underlying issues in core components.

- **Documentation Maintenance:**
  Efforts were made to keep the project's documentation current. This included removing a deprecated dashboard tracker ([#1170](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1170)) and updating a link related to token claiming procedures ([#1171](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1171)).
