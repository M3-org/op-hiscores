# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Weekly Report (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push to enhance the Superchain-Ops tooling, resulting in major improvements to development workflows and CI efficiency. Key achievements include the implementation of stacked simulations for sequential task execution and optimizations that streamline CI job performance. This effort culminated in the closure of numerous long-standing issues related to automation, developer experience, and validation. Meanwhile, active discussions continued around release pipeline automation and diagnosing abnormal CPU usage in recent `op-geth` versions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The week's development activity was concentrated on improving the Superchain-Ops framework and developer tooling.

- **Superchain-Ops Workflow Enhancements:** A major effort was made to streamline development and deployment processes. Stacked simulations were implemented to allow for sequential task execution with proper nonce coordination, resolving key issues related to task scheduling and CI efficiency ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/337), [#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/342)). CI job performance for template regression tests was also improved by optimizing chain discovery ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/648)). To ensure consistency with production, task fetching was updated to use the mainnet task directory ([#547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/547), [#600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/600)).

- **Developer Experience and Tooling:** Several improvements were made to enhance the developer experience. The `AccountAccessParser` was updated to output state diffs in a more readable Markdown format ([#777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/777]), and the `SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER` functionality was refined for better interactive simulation ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/448)). To reduce unnecessary submodule updates, a more granular check of `addresses.json` was implemented ([#753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/753)). Additionally, training sessions and videos were created to onboard stakeholders to the new tooling ([#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/514)).

- **Documentation Updates:** A new pull request ([#1166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1166)) was opened to update the `citizenship-eligibility-requirements.mdx` file. Paths in existing improvement documentation were also corrected to reflect current file structures ([#548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/548)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were resolved, primarily related to the Superchain-Ops enhancements. Key closures include:
    - **Automation & Efficiency:** Issues enabling automatic task execution in CI ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/337]), supporting "stacked" proposals ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/342]), and optimizing CI job performance ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/648)).
    - **Tooling & DX:** Issues were closed for updating task paths to mainnet directories ([#547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/547), [#600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/600)) and providing training for new tooling ([#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/514)).
    - **Contracts & Validation:** Issues were resolved concerning `MultisigTask` architecture ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/636)) and updating tests to use modern libraries ([#605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/605)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - A new issue ([#1165](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1165)) was opened reporting a broken link in the "custom-gas-tokens" documentation, highlighting a need for ongoing maintenance.
    - **Release Automation ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16097)):** Discussion is ongoing about the best approach for automating release notes, weighing the use of `GoReleaser` against a lighter-weight `git-cliff` solution, with concerns raised about avoiding further bloat in the build system.
    - **`op-geth` CPU Usage ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/613)):** An investigation into abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth v1.101511.0` continues. While some contributors reported that usage returned to normal after an index upgrade, others noted the issue persisted, suggesting the root cause is still under review.
    - **Superchain-Ops Output ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/781)):** Multiple contributors are collaborating on an issue to reduce noisy terminal output from the `signFromChildMultisig` function, aiming to improve the clarity of signing information.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week saw strong collaboration, particularly around the Superchain-Ops tooling. The resolution of numerous related issues ([#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/514)) included the creation of training materials, indicating a focus on internal knowledge sharing.

Active discussions on key issues demonstrated a healthy and engaged community. For instance, the `op-geth` CPU issue ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/613)) involved several users sharing performance data and debugging steps. Similarly, the debate on release automation ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16097)) featured a constructive exchange on technical strategy between core contributors. Finally, multiple community members expressed interest and provided suggestions for tackling the noisy terminal output in issue [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/781), showcasing a collaborative approach to improving developer experience.
