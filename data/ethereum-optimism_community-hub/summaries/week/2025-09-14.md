# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on maintenance, issue resolution, and critical discussions related to future network upgrades. While new feature development was quiet, significant progress was made in closing out issues related to developer tooling, including improvements to `op-acceptor` and the Forge Deployer. Key ongoing discussions focused on resolving persistent test flakiness, clarifying token bridging behavior, and ensuring `op-node` compatibility for the upcoming Fusaka hardfork. The primary theme was one of stabilization and preparation for future development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The sole code-related change this week was a documentation update.

- **Documentation Enhancements**
    - The `get-support.mdx` file was updated to provide current information within the grant section, ensuring community members have access to the latest details ([#1186](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1186)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was a major focus, with several issues closed and important discussions continuing on active ones.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Tooling & Testing Improvements:** Several issues related to the `op-acceptor` tool were resolved, including adding configuration logging at startup ([#461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/461)) and fixing sub-optimal package parallelism ([#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/462)). An issue to create a CLI wrapper for the Forge binary was also closed ([#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17214)).
    - **Fusaka Hardfork Preparation:** An issue to prepare `proxyd` for Fusaka activation on L1 by updating geth blob transaction handling was closed ([#467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/467)).
    - **Housekeeping:** An issue regarding a dispute game creator pattern refactor was closed as a duplicate ([#17436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17436)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **New Documentation Bug:** A new issue was opened to report a broken link for CEX listing request documentation ([#1185](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1185)).
    - **Persistent Test Flakiness:** A significant ongoing challenge is the flakiness of `TestPreNoInbox` in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17298)). Discussions confirmed that a recent fix was ineffective, requiring further investigation.
    - **Fusaka Compatibility:** A critical discussion is underway in [#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17493) concerning `op-node`'s compatibility with Fusaka, particularly around blob gas handling and the risks of tight coupling with upstream Geth code.
    - **Token Bridging:** An active discussion continues to seek clarification on why a specific token is not bridging as expected, with maintainers investigating the implementation details ([#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1203)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was most visible within GitHub issues, where contributors and maintainers engaged in detailed technical discussions to diagnose problems and refine specifications. The ongoing dialogue around the `TestPreNoInbox` flakiness ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17298)) and Fusaka compatibility ([#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17493)) highlights a community-driven effort to address complex, foundational issues through shared analysis and problem-solving. Similarly, discussions on token bridging ([#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1203)) and documentation improvements ([#771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/771)) demonstrate active collaboration in refining the ecosystem.
