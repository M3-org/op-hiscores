# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Weekly Report (Sep 21 - 27, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on enhancing the Community Hub's documentation and making key infrastructure decisions. A significant new Superchain revenue explainer was introduced to the `op-token` section, accompanied by several metadata and formatting updates to improve clarity and navigation. On the technical front, a strategic decision was made to move away from Kurtosis for testing environments, leading to the closure of a related integration issue. Additionally, a UI bug in the sidebar was resolved, and work to enable flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers was completed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on content creation and user experience improvements within the hub.

- **Superchain Revenue Documentation:** A concerted effort was made to improve information regarding the OP Token and Superchain economics.
  - A new Superchain revenue explainer document was added, providing valuable context for the community ([#1187]).
  - This was supported by several follow-up pull requests to update navigation metadata ([#1188], [#1189]), adjust heading formats ([#1191]), and refine content by removing emojis for stylistic consistency ([#1192]).

- **UI Bug Fix:** A bug affecting the sidebar display was resolved, improving navigation and the overall user experience within the community hub ([#1190]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was characterized by the resolution of older tasks and strategic deprioritization.

- **Closed Issues:** Two key issues were closed, marking progress in infrastructure and a shift in technical strategy.
  - **Testing Strategy Shift:** The issue to integrate `op-test-sequencer` with Kurtosis ([#15265]) was closed. This decision reflects a strategic move away from using Kurtosis for the devnet environment, as confirmed in the issue discussion.
  - **Infrastructure Deployment:** The task to enable flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers was completed and its corresponding issue was closed ([#16761]).

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened during this period. The discussion around the now-closed issue `#15265` was the most significant activity, but there are no major new or ongoing blockers reported.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
- The development pattern this week showed focused, iterative work, with a series of related pull requests from a single contributor to roll out the new Superchain revenue explainer.
- The closure of issue `#15265` involved input from several team members (`janjakubnanista`, `emhane`, `ajsutton`, `teddyknox`), demonstrating a collaborative process in making key decisions about the project's testing infrastructure.
- Based on the provided reports, there were no unusually high levels of discussion on pull requests or evidence of new contributor activity this week.
