## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI Flakiness Investigation
Discussions continued on investigating and improving CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16271)). On June 9th, `scharissis` provided a list of the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests, noting that most flakiness stems from infrastructure issues rather than acceptance testing itself. Subsequent comments on June 13th and 24th indicate progress, including the release of a test flake report generator and improvements in test flakiness.

### op-supervisor L1 Origin Validity
The issue concerning improving L1 origin validity handling during resets in the op-supervisor ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16315)) saw active discussion. On June 9th, `sebastianst` agreed that walkbacks should be avoided to reduce complexity and that the supervisor should only provide valid targets. A later comment on June 27th by `pcw109550` highlighted that a L1 origin verifier method has been added to the supervisor, but needs to be extended to safe heads.

### Incorrect Nonce from eth_getTransactionCount
The issue where `eth_getTransactionCount` returns an incorrect nonce for pending transactions ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/623)) received a comment on June 9th from `ntrzr` requesting someone to look into it, followed by `mukul3097` on June 12th asking for an update.

### Quickstart Guide for Superchain Interop Environment
Discussion continued on creating a quickstart guide for the Superchain Interop environment ([#1644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1644)). On June 9th, `krofax` committed to having a draft by the next day, and `sbvegan` mentioned that the team is exploring this as potential content for a homepage, possibly with a wider scope.

### Complete Withdrawal Flow Test
Progress on the "Complete Withdrawal Flow Test" ([#327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/327)) was updated on June 9th by `serpixel`, stating that it has been implemented in a related PR ([#16333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16333)) and requires two follow-up tickets for further enhancements.
