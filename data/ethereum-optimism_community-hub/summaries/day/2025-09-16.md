## NEW ISSUES
- **Documentation Link Issues**
    - A broken link for CEX listing requests documentation was reported, hindering community members from accessing information on how to request a CEX listing for OP [#1185](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1185).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Addressing Test Flakiness**
    - Discussion continued on taming `TestPreNoInbox` flakiness in `op-acceptance-tests` [#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17298). A recent comment indicated that a previous pull request (`ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17495`) did not resolve the issue, and another flake was observed.

- **Clarifying Token Bridging Behavior**
    - An ongoing discussion seeks clarification on why a specific token is not bridging to another token on Base, despite a related pull request being merged [#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1203). A maintainer suggested that the destination token might not be an OptimismMintableERC20, which would explain why the generated entry lacks a bridge address. Verification of the implementation was suggested to confirm this.

- **Improving Protocol System Configuration Documentation**
    - Work continues on cleaning up `protocol/system-config.md` [#771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/771). A recent suggestion was made to format the report by including both the numerical value and the canonical name for config update enums (e.g., `MIN_BASE_FEE` and `6`).
