# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Daily Update (Jun 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in streamlining development workflows and improving the Superchain-Ops tooling. Key achievements include the implementation of stacked simulations for tasks, enhanced validation processes, and updates to task paths for mainnet integration. Several long-standing issues related to CI efficiency and developer experience were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain-Ops Workflow Enhancements
- Implemented stacked simulations for tasks, allowing for sequential execution and improved nonce coordination, addressing long-standing issues related to task scheduling and CI efficiency ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/342), [#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/337)).
- Refined the `SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER` functionality for more interactive task simulation ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/448)).
- Improved CI job performance for template regression tests by optimizing chain discovery and address registry lookups ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/648)).

### Documentation and Path Updates
- Updated task fetching to use the mainnet task directory, ensuring consistency with production environments ([#547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/547)).

- Updated task paths for mainnet tasks to ensure monorepo integration tests point to the correct directories ([#600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/600)).

### Developer Experience and Tooling Improvements
- Conducted training sessions and created Loom videos to onboard internal stakeholders to the new Superchain-Ops tooling ([#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/514)).
- Enhanced the `print()` functionality in `AccountAccessParser` to output state diffs in a more readable Markdown format ([#777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/777)).
- Implemented more granular checking of `addresses.json` to reduce the frequency of `scr` submodule updates ([#753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/753)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#1166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1166): This pull request proposes an update to the `citizenship-eligibility-requirements.mdx` file.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain-Ops Automation and Efficiency
- Several issues related to automating tasks in CI and improving the efficiency of the Superchain-Ops framework were closed. This includes enabling automatic task execution in CI for non-terminal states ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/337)), supporting "stacked" proposals with incrementing nonces ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/342)), and optimizing CI job performance ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/648)).

### Developer Experience and Tooling Refinements
- Issues focused on enhancing the developer experience and refining tooling within the Superchain-Ops repository were resolved. This includes ensuring `SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER` checks for a value of `1` ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/448)), updating task paths for mainnet directories ([#547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/547), [#600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/600)), and providing training for new tooling ([#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/514)).

### Contract and Validation Improvements
- Multiple issues concerning contract architecture, testing, and validation processes were closed. This includes revisiting `MultisigTask` architecture ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/636)), updating tests to use `safe-tools` and `stdStorage` libraries ([#605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/605)), and ensuring prevalidations are possible without hindrance from the address registry ([#654](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/654)).

### Documentation and Testing Updates
- Issues related to documentation accuracy and testing procedures were addressed. This includes updating paths in improvement documents ([#548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/548)), creating mainnet examples for OPCM templates ([#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/651)), and checking domain hashes from simulation against `VALIDATIONS.md` ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/679)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Release Pipeline Automation and Changelog Generation
- **[#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16097) Use GoReleaser for op-node/batcher/proposer/challenger release pipeline**
    - **Latest Discussion:** `geoknee` suggested wiring up `op-workbench release-notes op-batcher` to automatically execute `git cliff` commands for generating release notes and pushing them to GitHub via API. This builds on previous discussions about committing changelog solutions to the codebase and using `git-cliff` for lighter-weight changelog generation. The core challenge remains streamlining the release process and avoiding further fragmentation of build systems, as highlighted by `protolambda`'s concerns about existing bloat and the need for a monorepo-first approach to GoReleaser.

### Optimism Geth CPU Usage
- **[#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/613) Abnormal CPU usage with latest op-geth (v1.101511.0)**
    - **Latest Discussion:** `jsvisa` provided instructions on how to use `pprof` to capture CPU performance data for `op-geth`, suggesting that the high CPU usage might be temporary due to log indexing rebuilds in `v1.101511.0`. `cpuchainorg` noted that the issue persists even after index upgrades and questioned why `op-geth` uses significantly more CPU than standard `go-ethereum`. `hekich` confirmed that CPU usage returned to normal after the index upgrade completed, suggesting it is indeed a temporary issue.

### Superchain-Ops Migrate Script Improvements
- **[#16326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16326) OPCM Migrate Script Improvements**
    - **Latest Discussion:** `Inphi` closed the issue, stating that the runbook has been updated to include sanity checks for script inputs, resolving the need for further improvements.

### Superchain-Ops Test Workflow Consolidation
- **[#16272](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16272) [op-acceptance-tests] Move all AT's into the one workflow**
    - **Latest Discussion:** `scharissis` provided links to related pull requests in `infra` and `optimism` repositories, indicating ongoing work to consolidate acceptance tests into a single workflow.

### Superchain-Ops Terminal Output Refinement
- **[#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/781) Refactor signFromChildMultisig to reduce noisy terminal output**
    - **Latest Discussion:** `JoseValperga` and `nsancheznez` expressed interest in working on the issue. `Cass402` identified the `print` function within `simulateRun` as the primary cause of noisy output and proposed removing or commenting it out to focus on critical signing information.

### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet
- **[#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/399) what's the difference between supersim and interop kurtosis devnet?**
    - **Latest Discussion:** `zhiqiangxu` clarified that supersim is mainly for testing dapps rather than chains, which aligns with `fainashalts`'s explanation that supersim is a local tool for testing multichain/interop applications, acting as a lighter wrapper around Anvil for local development.
