## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes
Discussion on [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/15789) "Fault Proof creator contract OPCM changes" continues, with stevennevins outlining a comprehensive checklist of tasks for July 9th, including moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, removing `anchorStateRegistry` from `StandardValidatorOverrides`, unskipping and updating tests in `DeployOPChain.t.sol`, reviewing comment responses, addressing TODO comments, rebasing updates from EVM safety, and fixing Go updates. Earlier, on June 10th, stevennevins linked to a related pull request: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16340.

### op-supervisor Event Overflow
The issue [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16335) "op-supervisor: Event overflow on large unsafe head gap" remains active. On June 10th, axelKingsley clarified that `ChainIndexingContinueEvent`s do not stack up, but are a response to previous `ChainProcess` events. They explained that `ChainIndexingContinueEvents` are emitted 1:1 by the indexing actor, and there should only be one per chain in the event system. This was a fix to previous behavior, and while it eliminated queue-depth issues in A/B tests, the current observation suggests other issues in the event system. Subsequent comments from June 17th and 19th by nonsense and sebastianst further discuss the potential culprits and propose adding gauges for in-flight events to better diagnose the issue.
