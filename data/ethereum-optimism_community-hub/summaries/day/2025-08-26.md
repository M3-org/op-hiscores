# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Daily Update (Aug 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on minor updates to documentation and font files. Significant discussions continued on active issues, particularly around `op-proposer` configuration and flashblocks monitoring.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Documentation and Asset Updates**
    *   Updated `govnerds.mdx` with S8 Charter information ([#1181](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1181)).
    *   Updated various font files and `global.css` ([#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1182)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Challenger Support in op-up**
    *   The issue of supporting the challenger within `op-up` was closed, with the conclusion that distributing the challenger via `op-up` for `sysgo` is likely not worth the effort, suggesting focus on other backends like Docker instead ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17005)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **op-proposer Failed to Create Transaction** ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/13502))
    *   A user confirmed that setting `--game-type=1` resolved their issue with `op-proposer` failing to create transactions, aligning with previous suggestions about misconfigured game types. The discussion highlights the importance of correct `game-type` settings for `op-proposer`.

*   **op-sync-tester, op-acceptance-tests: sync test using the sync-tester** ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16703))
    *   The issue was reopened as not all Hardfork (HF) transitions were tested. New test case ideas include checking all OP Stack HF transitions, validating multiple CLs syncing with a single Sync Tester, and testing user transactions within L2 blocks.

*   **Load Testing Flashblocks on Devnets** ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16756))
    *   A request was made for a summary document detailing the outcomes of the load tests, including scenarios, networks, and results.

*   **Alert when non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off** ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16867))
    *   Progress was noted with a pull request for `rollup-boost` that, once landed, will enable the creation of the desired alert.

*   **Alert on low peer count health of flashblocks-enabled sequencer** ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16868))
    *   It was noted that peer count alerting for `op-node` sequencer peering already exists. The plan is to add `reth`/`op-rbuilder` peer count monitoring for this specific alert.
