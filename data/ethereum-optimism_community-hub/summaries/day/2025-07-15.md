## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Infrastructure Optimization Discussions**
    *   Concluded discussions on the necessity of NVMe node deployment for op-rbuilders, deciding to skip it for now based on current performance and focusing on more immediate issues. ([#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16689))
    *   Resolved the discussion regarding dedicated namespacing for rbuilders, opting to keep flashblocks components in the same namespace as other sequencer components to simplify initial effort. ([#16690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16690))
*   **Test Suite Enhancements**
    *   Successfully ported the `TestChainFork` to devstack, improving the acceptance test suite. ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/413))
*   **Codebase Refinement**
    *   Closed an issue regarding duplicate code in `op-batcher`, suggesting a potential cleanup. ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16677))
*   **Flashblocks Enablement**
    *   Deprioritized and closed the issue concerning enabling flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers, shifting focus to stabilizing flashblocks on OP Labs Sepolia infrastructure first. ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16688))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Txpool Interop Transaction Inclusion** ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/635))
    *   Discussion continues on a flaky issue where invalid interop execution message transactions are conditionally included in the txpool. @pcw109550 provided detailed logs and artifacts from CI runs demonstrating the flakiness, where an invalid transaction was sometimes included and sometimes evicted. @axelKingsley is actively investigating but has been unable to reproduce the issue consistently despite extensive testing and tracing through `geth`'s `Add` function, noting that all transactions should pass through the ingress filter. The challenge lies in understanding how an invalid transaction bypasses this filter.
