No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Test and Validation Refinement
Two issues related to testing and validation were closed today. The "Fusaka activation test" issue, aimed at creating a specific test for Fusaka (Osaka) activation on L1, was closed via [#17666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/17666) ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17500)). Additionally, the "validation: add chain config negative testing" issue, which sought to improve validation code testing, was closed as it is no longer relevant due to a shift to a report-based approach ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/686)).

## NEW ISSUES
### BEP Documentation
Two new issues were opened today, both referencing "BEPs/BEP2.md" ([#1193](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1193), [#1194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/1194)). The bodies of these issues were not provided, suggesting they might be placeholders or related to documentation updates.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility
Discussion continued on the "cannon: Support go1.25" issue ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17060)). On October 3rd, @pauldowman confirmed that the issue does affect Optimism, with @ajsutton providing more context. @sebastianst had previously inquired if the issue, which seems to affect some emulated MIPS hardware, was relevant. The blocking issue, https://github.com/golang/go/issues/74998, was linked by @pauldowman. Earlier comments from September indicated that Go 1.25.1 was released but did not appear to include the MIPS fix. The latest comment on October 5th from @ajsutton confirmed that all keccak hashes are incorrect when running in cannon with go1.25, impacting block hash calculations, and linked a detailed diagnosis.
