### op-batcher and Alternative Data Availability
Discussion continued on issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17796), which addresses whether the `op-batcher` should limit max frame size to max input size in generic mode for alternative data availability. The latest comments indicate that the issue was addressed in a previous pull request, and there's a suggestion to update the Optimism specs to reflect this change, as the current spec might be misleading.
