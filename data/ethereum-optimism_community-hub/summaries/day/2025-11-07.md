## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher and Alternative Data Availability
Discussions continued on issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17796), concerning the `op-batcher` and its interaction with alternative data availability (altDA) regarding max frame size. The latest comment from nuke-web3 suggests that the relevant specification document should be updated to reflect the current implementation, as the existing spec might now contain outdated information regarding `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` and `commitment_type == 0`. This follows an earlier comment from tessr indicating that the issue was addressed in a previous pull request and questioning if the issue could now be closed.
