# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Daily Update (Aug 25, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on minor content updates within the community hub, specifically clarifying eligibility for the Citizens' House and updating a contributor page. Several issues were closed, primarily related to internal tracking and previously completed work.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Community Content Updates
*   Updated the techNERD contribution page with the latest information ([#1177](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1177)).
*   Clarified that the list of eligible chains and apps refers to Citizenship eligibility to avoid confusion with grants eligibility ([#1180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1180)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Internal Tracking and Development Decisions
*   The tracking issue for "Jovian + Karst: Consensus influencing event nonces" was closed as the implementation is not planned for the near future ([#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/13543)).
*   An issue regarding "op-service: Event Call Graph" was closed, noting that similar functionality exists elsewhere and the team is moving away from the event system ([#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16874)).
*   The issue "op-up: clean up logging" was closed, as it's not considered worthwhile without `op-geth` eliminating global logger use ([#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17007)).

### Postmortem and Test Log Resolution
*   The "[Scalar fix] Postmortem of original issue" was closed, indicating the work was completed last week ([#17012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17012)).
*   An issue concerning "op-acceptance-tests: Missing test logs" was closed after the logs were located in root logs ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17151)).
