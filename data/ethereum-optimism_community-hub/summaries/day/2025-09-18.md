## ACTIVE ISSUES

**`op-node` Fusaka Compatibility**
*   Discussion on [#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17493) highlighted a concern regarding potential absolute prestate updates if `op-node` is tightly coupled to upstream Geth code, especially with every upstream merge and `op-geth` / `op-node` release. The issue aims to ensure compatibility with Fusaka, specifically concerning the derivation pipeline and converting excess blob gas into L1 cost, by hardcoding Fusaka and blob parameter-only hardfork [EIP 7892](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-789).
