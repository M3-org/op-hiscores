## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI Flakiness Investigation
The issue [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16271) concerning CI flakiness remains active. Recent comments indicate progress in addressing this, with a test flake report generator released and iterated upon, and the report publicized. The latest update from scharissis on June 24, 2025, confirms improvements in test flakiness and states that monitoring will continue. Earlier discussions highlighted specific flaky acceptance tests and noted that much of the flakiness was due to infrastructure and networking issues rather than acceptance testing itself.

### Incorrect Nonce for Pending Transactions
Issue [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/623) reports that `eth_getTransactionCount` returns an incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending transactions on the Base node, causing transactions to get stuck. On June 12, 2025, mukul3097 inquired about any updates, indicating the issue is still pending resolution. Previous comments from ntrzr and mukul3097 also sought updates, emphasizing the ongoing nature of this problem.
