## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Contract Verification Improvements
Discussion on [#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/14813) highlights the ongoing effort to improve contract verification. The latest comment suggests revisiting `op-deployer` contract verification to leverage `forge verify-contract` once forge binary support is implemented. This aims to reduce custom verification code and streamline the process by passing correct arguments to the forge command. Earlier discussions also considered using Sourcify for verification.
