### Validation Test Planning and Scope
Discussion continued on [#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/686), which addresses the need for improved validation testing, particularly for chain configuration. The latest comment from alfonso-op (2025-08-22T17:01:27Z) indicates a planned discussion with @bitwiseguy and Tess to review the scope of validation tests, specifically focusing on whether any tests previously marked as "not planned" should still be implemented. This follows an earlier comment from alfonso-op (2024-12-11T15:13:17Z) tasking @bitwiseguy with creating sub-issues for different validation tests. Previous discussions by geoknee (2024-11-25T18:04:39Z and 2024-11-25T18:02:51Z) highlighted the brittleness of TOML file parsing and suggested moving complexity into pure functions for better testability and formalizing them as production code.
