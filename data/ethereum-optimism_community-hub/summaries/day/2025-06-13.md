## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI Flakiness Investigation and Improvement
Discussions on [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16271) continued, with `scharissis` noting the release and iteration of a "Flakiness Report" generator, which now includes "Job Name" to provide more clues on the source of flakiness. This report is publicly available and aims to improve visibility into CI stability. The issue was subsequently closed on June 24th, with `scharissis` confirming improvements in test flakiness and a commitment to continued monitoring.

### Acceptance Test Reliability
On [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16378), `scharissis` highlighted the new "Flakiness Report" as a tool to monitor and improve acceptance test reliability. `nonsense` previously noted that `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` and tests within the `reorg` package pass with `-count=5`, indicating some level of stability. The issue was later closed on July 9th by `nonsense`, stating that tests have been considerably improved, with an emphasis on continuous monitoring and preventing the introduction of new flaky tests.
