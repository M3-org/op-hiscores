# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on maintenance, with a critical Next.js security upgrade and a linting fix. An important issue regarding `cannonKonaPrestate` documentation was closed, while discussions continued on interop transaction evaluation and node synchronization problems.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dependency Upgrades and Security Patches
*   Upgraded Next.js to version 14.2.35 to address a security vulnerability ([#1198](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1198)).

### Code Quality and Maintenance
*   Resolved linting issues by adding a missing word to the dictionary ([#1199](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1199)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
None

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation of Standard Chain Requirements
*   The issue concerning the documentation of the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for standard chain upgrades has been closed as completed, with mention of a one-pager provided to the docs team ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18095)).

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interoperability: Evaluating and Reworking Injected Replacement Transactions
Discussions on [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18574) centered on simplifying the interop specification by removing the additional replacement transaction. The latest comments suggest an alignment on this simplification, particularly noting that the replacement transaction provides no value in a ZK dispute system as ZK proofs inherently re-run derivation. Concerns were raised about the downsides of the super node just recording data (lack of consensus checks, data availability issues), but these are considered less critical with ZK.

### Node Synchronization Issues
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18581) continues to address problems with nodes not synchronizing, specifically "missing trie node" errors. The latest comment from @yaki-1337 confirms the use of a full node without an archive, no improper shutdowns, and OP-GETH. They are now asking for guidance on where to download OP-GETH or if it's time to switch to Reth, indicating a persistent challenge with node setup and data integrity.

### Reworking Proofs Action Testing for Supernodes
The discussion on [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18621) focuses on adapting proof action testing for the Supernode architecture. The latest comments emphasize the importance of testing the `op-challenger` against a real Supernode implementation, especially for interop scenarios. It's suggested that if a better approach for testing these scenarios exists within Supernode, rewriting the proofs tests to align with that approach would be beneficial, rather than forcing Supernode into the current action test framework.

### Use of File-Relative Paths Instead of Project-Relative
On [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/10202), the latest comment from @manu-qiro confirms that adding context-aware remappings resolved the issue for them, following a suggestion from @alexkeating. This indicates a potential solution for the problem of project-relative paths causing import failures in various environments like Foundry.
