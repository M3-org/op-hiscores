# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on maintenance and infrastructure upgrades, including a critical Next.js security patch and a linting fix. Discussions continued on interop transaction evaluation and node synchronization issues, alongside a new spike for reworking proofs action testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Infrastructure & Security Updates**
    *   Upgraded Next.js to version 14.2.35 to address a security vulnerability ([#1198](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1198)).
    *   Resolved linting issues by adding a missing word to the dictionary ([#1199](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1199)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
None.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Documentation of Cannon-Kona Prestate Requirement**
    *   The issue of documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades was closed as completed, with the docs team having received a one-pager on the topic ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18095)).

## NEW ISSUES
None.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Interop Transaction Evaluation and Rework** ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18574))
    *   Discussion centered on simplifying the protocol by eliminating the additional deposit transaction for proofs, with a consensus emerging that the Supernode should be able to generate necessary data.
    *   Concerns were raised about the downsides of the Supernode merely recording data, specifically regarding lack of consensus-based accuracy checks and data availability for challengers.
    *   The critical role of the additional transaction in the proofs system for the Fault Dispute Game was highlighted, especially for preventing honest challengers from being overwhelmed.

*   **Node Synchronization Issues** ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18581))
    *   A user reported persistent "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors, indicating an incomplete or corrupted state database.
    *   Debugging efforts focused on clarifying the type of node (full vs. archive), occurrence after unclean shutdowns, and the specific execution client (op-geth or reth) being used.
    *   Suggestions included restarting with `--syncmode=full` or checking disk IOPS. The user confirmed using a full node without an archive and op-geth, and inquired about downloading op-geth or switching to Reth.

*   **Reworking Proofs Action Testing for Supernodes** ([#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18621))
    *   The discussion revolved around adapting existing action testing for the Supernode architecture, leveraging virtual nodes within Chain Containers.
    *   Key questions included how to test the actual Supernode implementation and whether to integrate Supernode into current action tests or rewrite tests to fit a new Supernode-specific approach.
    *   It was noted that challenger tests would particularly benefit from running against a real Supernode to accurately test interactions. The intrusiveness required to generate scenarios for interop testing with `op-challenger` was also highlighted.

*   **Use File-Relative Paths Instead of Project-Relative** ([#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/10202))
    *   A user provided a solution for a similar issue they encountered, suggesting context-aware remappings for `foundry.toml` to resolve compilation problems with project-relative paths.
    *   The user `manu-qiro` confirmed that adding context-aware remappings solved their issue.
