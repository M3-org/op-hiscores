# ethereum-optimism/community-hub Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on maintenance with a critical security upgrade to Next.js and a linting fix. Discussions continued on interop transaction evaluation and node synchronization issues, alongside a new spike for reworking proofs action testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dependency Upgrades and Security Patches
A significant update was made to upgrade Next.js to version 14.2.35 to address a security vulnerability, ensuring the platform remains secure and up-to-date [#1198](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1198).

### Code Quality and Maintenance
A minor bug fix was implemented to resolve linting issues by adding a missing word to the dictionary, improving code consistency and preventing future errors [#1199](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1199).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation of Standard Chain Requirements
The issue concerning the documentation of the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades was closed, indicating that the necessary documentation has been provided to the docs team [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18095).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interoperability Transaction Evaluation and Rework
Discussions continued on evaluating and reworking injected replacement transactions for interop [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18574). The latest comments highlight a consensus on simplifying the protocol by eliminating additional deposit transactions for proofs, with the Supernode expected to generate necessary data. Concerns were raised about the accuracy of non-consensus data and its availability for challengers, especially in the context of FaultDisputeGame versus ZK proofs.

### Node Synchronization Issues
The issue regarding nodes not synchronizing [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18581) saw further troubleshooting. The latest comments suggest that "missing trie node" errors often indicate an incomplete or corrupted state database. Users are being asked to clarify their node type (full/archive), check for unclean shutdowns, and specify their execution client (op-geth or reth) to aid in debugging.

### Reworking Proofs Action Testing for Supernodes
A new spike was opened to rework proofs action testing to support Supernodes [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/18621). Recent comments discuss the integration of Supernode into the testing framework. The key question revolves around how to test the actual Supernode implementation and whether existing action tests are suitable or if a new approach is needed, especially considering the Supernode's role in providing data for `op-challenger`.

### File-Relative Paths vs. Project-Relative Paths
Discussion continued on using file-relative paths instead of project-relative paths [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/10202). The latest comment from `manu-qiro` indicates that "context aware remappings" solved the issue for them, referencing a previous suggestion by `alexkeating` to modify remappings for compilation.
