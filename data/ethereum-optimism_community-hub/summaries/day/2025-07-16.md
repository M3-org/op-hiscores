## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Sequencer Stability & Recovery**
    *   Closed issues related to sequencer halting on temporary errors ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/12240)) and recovery from sequence window expiration incidents ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/11228)), indicating these issues are no longer considered active or have been resolved.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Recovery from sequence window expiration incident** ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/11228))
    *   The issue was closed by mslipper, who requested it be reopened if still relevant. Previously, geoknee noted that "incident mode" (now "recover mode") was implemented, which helps address this. The discussion also touched upon manual intervention being reasonable for rare sequencing window expiry and automatic blob congestion handling.
*   **Sequencer halting on temporary error** ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/12240))
    *   This issue was closed by mslipper, who asked for it to be reopened if the problem persists. Earlier discussions included reports of sequencer halts when L1 becomes unavailable and attempts at simple fixes.
*   **Update NPM Package: @eth-optimism/contracts-bedrock** ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/13459))
    *   The issue was closed by mslipper, stating that the NPM packages are no longer being updated.
*   **Can not start new node with op-node** ([#15411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/15411))
    *   The issue was closed by geoknee, assuming it was resolved, but inviting reopening if it remains an issue. An earlier comment suggested trying Alchemy as the L1 RPC.
