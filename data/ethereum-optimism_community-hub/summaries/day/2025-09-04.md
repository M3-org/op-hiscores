## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Flashblocks Deployment and Configuration**
Discussions continued on several flashblocks-related issues. For [#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16759), updates were provided on associated PRs and remaining tasks, including deploying rollup-boost in disabled mode and then enabling its execution mode. Similarly, for [#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16761), the latest updates confirmed that both sunnyside sequencers have `op-rbuilder` deployed and synced, with next steps involving rollup-boost deployment and execution mode enablement. The deployment of `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` [#16763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16763) is currently blocked on the availability of websocket connection of conductors, but a PR is in progress. The need for `flashblocks-rpc` node deployment [#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/16764) is being reconfirmed. Finally, for [#17162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17162), associated PRs for closing out the Flashblocks spec were noted.

**P2P Gossip Configuration Bug**
Issue [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17308) discusses a bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values. The latest comments delve into the implications of invalid configuration values (e.g., `Dhi=0` and `Dscore=4` causing panics in `go-libp2p-pubsub`) and potential solutions, including adding a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to return a fully filled, valid `P2PConfig` with sensible defaults.

**Sync-Tester Network Exposure**
In [#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/454), the discussion revolves around exposing more networks inside the CI box for `op-sync-tester`. Updates confirm that L2 ELs for mainnet and sepolia are exposed for several networks (unichain, ink, base). The remaining task is to expose an L1 beacon API in CI. A draft PR was shared to make the synctest more dynamic with environment variables.

**Geth Initialization Error**
Issue [#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/420) continues to receive comments regarding the "head block is not reachable" error during `op-geth` initialization. A new comment confirms that this error is still being encountered.
