## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Congestion-based Builder Transaction Reordering
Issue [#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/306), which focuses on designing a congestion-based builder transaction reordering mechanism, received a new comment from `moonfury-ops`. The comment, posted at 2025-07-29T20:33:56Z, expresses interest in collaborating on the issue. The issue's body outlines the idea of tracking excess DA usage over time with an exponential cost/score penalty, suggesting it could be implemented outside the protocol to test the concept for an L1 congestion cost component.
