### Forge Deployer Migration Progress
Discussions continued on the "Forge Deployer" migration, with multiple team members expressing interest in contributing. User tooshiNoko offered to take on several related tasks, including creating a CLI wrapper around the Forge binary ([#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17214)), converting `DeploySuperchain` ([#17215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17215)), `DeployImplementations` ([#17216](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17216)), and `DeployOPChain` ([#17217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17217)) to use Forge, and converting contract verification logic ([#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17218)). There was also a discussion about coordinating efforts on the overall tracking issue for the migration ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17213)) to avoid overlapping work.

A summary of the progress indicated that tests were largely implemented, with two outstanding PRs needing cleanup and merging. The estimated size for completion was S.
