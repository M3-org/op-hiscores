### Flashblocks Stability and Coordination
A critical issue with the Flashblocks-websocket-proxy losing Flashblocks was identified and resolved, attributed to connectivity issues and subscriber pong timeouts. This fix was implemented through upgrades with rollup-boost ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17856)). Additionally, coordination efforts with Flashblocks RPC providers regarding the new Flashblocks RPC node were completed, with most providers having integrated the changes ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17857)).

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-dispute-mon: Handling Out-of-Sync Nodes
Discussion continued on how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes, specifically when multiple rollup RPCs are configured and one is behind. The core problem is that the monitor incorrectly detects disagreement between nodes when one is merely out of sync. A key point of discussion was whether to trust the highest L2 block or to use `syncStatus.CurrentL1` to determine if a node is sufficiently in sync. It was noted that trusting the highest L2 block might be problematic if that node followed an incorrect fork. The issue was briefly closed by mistake and then reopened, with a proposed solution to use `syncStatus` to identify and ignore results from behind nodes, while treating future proposals as currently handled ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/17814)).
