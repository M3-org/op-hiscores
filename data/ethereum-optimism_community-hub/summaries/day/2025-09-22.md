## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-test-sequencer` Integration in Devnet ([#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/15265))
This issue, initially opened to add `op-test-sequencer` to the devnet environment and Kurtosis, was closed today. The latest comment from `janjakubnanista` confirms the closure due to a strategic shift away from using `kurtosis`. Previously, `emhane` highlighted its necessity for running reorg tests in the `kona-supervisor` devstack environment, and `ajsutton` had reopened it due to a pending todo in the code. `teddyknox` had initially deprioritized it pending use-cases for testing with `sysgo`. The current status indicates a change in approach for testing.
