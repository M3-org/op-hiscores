## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Improving CI/CD User Experience and Testability
Discussions on [#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17184) centered on improving the user experience and testability of the monorepo's CircleCI configuration. Key points included identifying high-value CI jobs for local execution (e.g., `kurtosis` and `go-tests-short`), addressing friction from automated prerequisite setup, and the potential for automating CircleCI config syntax validation. There was also an interesting idea about dynamically sorting Go tests by execution time to optimize local test runs and potentially categorize them for post-merge execution if they exceed certain time thresholds.

### Kona + Cannon Integration and OPCM Support
Discussions on [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17285) and [#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17283) continued regarding the integration of Kona and Cannon into the tooling and OPCM. For OPCM support, it was confirmed that the system needs to support deploying the new game type, specifically updating an `if` block in `OPContractsManager.sol`. For standard prestates integration, the suggestion was to use a `type = "cannon-kona"` field in `standard-prestates.toml`, with the version number not necessarily needing to match `op-program`.

### P2P Gossip Configuration Bug
Issue [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17308) highlighted a bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values, leading to panics in certain tests due to invalid configurations (e.g., `Dhi=0` and `Dscore=4`). The discussion explored whether to make invalid configs work or to introduce a `DefaultP2PConfig` method that returns a fully filled, valid configuration with sensible defaults, allowing tests to modify only necessary options.

### Sync Test Using Sync-Tester
Issue [#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16703) was reopened as not all Hardfork (HF) transitions were tested. Suggestions for future test cases include checking every OP Stack HF transition, using multiple CLs with a single Sync Tester to validate multi-CL syncing, and incorporating user transactions into L2 blocks to ensure L2CLs sync correctly.

### Go 1.25 Compatibility for Cannon
Discussion on [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17060) noted the release of Go 1.25.1, but questioned if it includes the MIPS fix.

### Min-Base-Fee for PayloadAttributesV3
Issue [#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/650) received a comment pointing to the updated specs for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3`.

### Script for Permissionless Devnet Spinup
Issue [#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/346) had a comment asking if it could be closed, indicating potential completion or irrelevance.
