# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Daily Update (Sep 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on integrating new data and weights for M7, alongside discussions on improving Kurtosis's local `op-geth` build capabilities and refining `op-batcher` metrics.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### RetroPGF Data Integration
*   Added M7 data and weights, impacting various evaluation algorithms and results files for both devtooling and onchain metrics. ([#77](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/77))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### op-batcher Throttling Metric Improvement
*   The issue regarding improving the `op-batcher`'s throttling intensity metric was closed, with a solution implemented in Grafana to only plot values greater than 0, making active controllers more visible. ([#17149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17149))

### op-geth Genesis File Handling
*   The issue concerning `op-geth` initialization with large genesis files and a LevelDB panic was closed. The resolution involved not storing the large `genesis.json` as a flat blob and instead importing the state into the DB, similar to how `op-mainnet` handles it. ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/668))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis Local op-geth Build Capability
*   Discussion continued on enabling Kurtosis to use a local `op-geth` build. A suggestion was made to leverage the templating system to automatically override the image, resolving to a Docker image URL constructed from the `go.mod` githash, or to allow cloning the source code temporarily and building a local Docker image.
