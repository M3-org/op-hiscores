## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interoperability and Genesis Configuration
Discussion continued on [#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/15765) regarding the validation of `CrossL2Inbox` configuration in the L2 genesis state. A comment from `ajsutton` on June 17th, 2025, argued against adding this validation to the execution client, stating that the genesis generation tooling (`op-deployer`) already sufficiently mitigates the risk of incorrect configurations. The tooling automatically determines if `CrossL2Inbox` should be included based on the presence of multiple chains, ensuring that only the correct genesis is generated.

### Release Pipeline Automation
Issue [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16097), concerning the use of GoReleaser for `op-node`/`batcher`/`proposer`/`challenger` release pipelines, saw a new comment from `geoknee` on June 17th, 2025. The comment suggested a lighter-weight solution for changelog generation using `git cliff`, providing a command example for `op-node` and `op-service` components. This indicates an ongoing effort to streamline and automate the release process, particularly for generating accurate release notes.

### `op-node` Stability and Goroutine Issues
The issue [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16332), reporting thousands of stuck goroutines in `op-node` v1.13.3's p2p.SyncClient, received a new comment from `Creamers158` on June 17th, 2025. The comment confirmed experiencing the same issue with `op-node` v1.13.3 and provided a detailed stack trace, highlighting `select`, `IO wait`, and `yamux` related goroutines. This indicates a persistent stability problem affecting `op-node`'s peer-to-peer synchronization.

### `op-supervisor` Event Overflow
Discussion on [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16335), regarding `op-supervisor` event overflow on large unsafe head gaps, continued with several comments on June 17th, 2025. `sebastianst` clarified that `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` was initially suspected due to its internal loop emission, but `axelKingsley`'s earlier point about it being a 1:1 emit/consume event suggests other events might be the true culprits. `nonsense` confirmed working on the issue and proposed adding a counter per event type (via [#16471](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16471)) to better debug which events are stacking up, acknowledging that `axelKingsley`'s assessment of `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` might be correct.

### Acceptance Tests in Persistent Devnets
Issue [#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/398), focused on getting all acceptance tests running and passing in persistent devnets, received an update from `serpixel` on June 17th, 2025. The comment noted the addition of L1 Faucet support via [#16423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16423), indicating progress in setting up the necessary infrastructure for comprehensive testing.

### Super DA Errors
Issue [#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/725), concerning the addition of missing Super DA Errors, saw a comment from `emhane` on June 17th, 2025, tagging relevant team members (`dhyaniarun1993`, `itschaindev`, `sadiq1971`) for their attention. This suggests the initial stages of addressing the need for more comprehensive error codes related to data availability.

### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet
Discussion on [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/399), differentiating between supersim and interop Kurtosis devnets, received a clarifying comment from `tremarkley` on June 17th, 2025. The comment explained that supersim is a lighter-weight wrapper around Anvil, primarily used for local development and testing multichain/interop applications, in contrast to Kurtosis which is used for testing the chains themselves.
