For [#13435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/13435), concerning an incorrect comment about byte size, Himess also asked if the issue was live and if they could take it.

Similarly, on [#13436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/13436), which addresses incorrect structured comments about the return value of `readMem` and `readMemUnchecked`, Himess again asked if the issue was live and available for contribution.

Regarding [#15220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/15220), concerning a Bedrock contracts test setup failure due to incorrect Solady library mapping, Himess asked if they could work on the issue.

On [#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18482), which proposes creating a new `op-spammer` component, scharissis suggested that existing prior art, specifically https://github.com/flashbots/contender/issues/145, might be sufficient.

For [#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18479), which suggests removing `isPectra` from the batcher, Himess indicated they had investigated the issue, noted that changes would be needed in approximately five Go files, and asked if they could take on the task.

They also recommended upgrading `op-geth` to v1.101603.5.
