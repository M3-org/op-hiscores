## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Devnet Deployment Warnings
Discussion continued on an issue concerning warnings observed in `op-node` when deploying a devnet using `create-l2-rollup-example` [#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/1898). A recent comment clarified that the "failed to publish newly created block" and "invalid block signature" warnings are not problematic for a local devnet. These warnings occur because the `op-node` attempts to publish blocks to the P2P network, but the peer does not recognize the block signature.
