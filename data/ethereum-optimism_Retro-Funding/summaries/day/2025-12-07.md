### Devnet Deployment Warnings
Discussion on [#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/1898) clarified that warnings observed in `op-node` during a devnet deployment using `create-l2-rollup-example` are not problematic for a local devnet. These warnings, such as "failed to publish newly created block" and "invalid block signature," occur because the `op-node` attempts to publish blocks to the P2P network, but the peer does not recognize the block signature.
