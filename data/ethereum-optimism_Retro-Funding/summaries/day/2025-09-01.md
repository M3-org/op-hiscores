## CLOSED ISSUES

**Proposer Error Resolution**
An issue concerning persistent `op-proposer` errors, specifically `GameAlreadyExists`, was closed. The error was clarified to be expected when the safe head has not advanced, leading to repeated proposals of the same output. Solutions involve ensuring the batcher is running correctly and potentially shortening its maximum channel duration for more frequent proposals. ([#17042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17042))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Dispute Monitor Support for New Game Types**
Discussions continued on the need for `op-dispute-mon` to support `cannon-kona` game types ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17286)). The initial understanding that `dispute-mon` should only look at specific game types was clarified; it must return an error if it encounters an unsupported game type. The issue was updated to reflect the need to support `cannon-kona` games.
