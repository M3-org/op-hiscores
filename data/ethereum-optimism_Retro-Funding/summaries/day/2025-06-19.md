## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-supervisor Event Overflow Investigation
Discussion continued on [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16335) regarding an `op-supervisor` event overflow issue. The latest comment from `nonsense` on June 19, 2025, indicates a pull request ([#16473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16473)) has been added to introduce a gauge for in-flight events within `GlobalSyncExec`. This aims to identify which event type is causing the overflow and potentially set up alerts for high thresholds. Previous discussions debated whether `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` or "cross-unsafe-update" events were the primary culprits.

### Clarifying supersim vs. interop kurtosis devnet
On [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/399), the discussion revolved around the differences between `supersim` and `interop kurtosis devnet` for local development. The latest comment from `zhiqiangxu` on June 19, 2025, sought clarification on `supersim`'s main use case, following a previous explanation that `supersim` is a lighter wrapper around `anvil` for testing multichain/interop applications.
