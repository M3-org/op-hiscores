# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Daily Update (Sep 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in closing out several long-standing issues related to the `min-base-fee` implementation and the `op-nat` Kurtosis integration. Discussions also continued on handling large genesis files and making chain configurations fully explicit.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Minimum Base Fee Implementation
Three issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature were closed, indicating progress in its integration. These include adding `minBaseFee` to the block header's `extraData` field ([#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/649)), adding an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3` ([#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/650)), and updating `eip1559.CalcBaseFee` to enforce the minimum if the feature is active ([#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/651)). All closures referenced the same `op-geth` pull request.

### Local Development Environment Prioritization
The issue concerning running `op-nat` in Kurtosis ([#158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/158)) was closed, citing a shift towards prioritizing other local development environments.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Handling Large Genesis Files
Discussion continued on the issue of `op-geth` initialization with large genesis files leading to a LevelDB panic ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/668)). The latest comment from @protolambda suggests modifying `op-geth` for a one-time import of state by not storing the `alloc` data as a flat JSON blob and instead importing the state directly into the DB. It also recommends including the `stateHash` attribute of the genesis block into the chain-`config` part of `genesis.json` to enable fresh nodes to snap-sync state from bootstrap nodes.

### Explicit Chain Configurations
The issue regarding making chain configurations fully explicit ([#763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/763)) received a new comment from @alfonso-op, questioning whether chain configs are already self-descriptive and if the issue can be closed.
