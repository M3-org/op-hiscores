# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Daily Update (Nov 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a critical bug fix for retroactive calculations affecting projects impacted by attestation signer downtime, ensuring accurate reward distribution. Discussions continued on several active issues, including Go 1.25 compatibility for Cannon and `op-batcher` synchronization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Retroactive Calculation Fixes
A bug affecting retroactive reward calculations for projects impacted by attestation signer downtime was fixed. This ensures accurate M7 and M8 rewards for a specific project that submitted its application during M7 but was affected by the OP Atlas attestation-signer drain. ([#83](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/83))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility
Discussions on [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17060) centered on the impact of Go 1.25 on Cannon, specifically regarding incorrect keccak hashes. The latest comment confirms that a fix for the underlying issue has been included in Go 1.25.4.

### op-batcher Max Frame Size in Generic Mode
Issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17796) addresses a bug where `op-batcher` incorrectly limits max frame size to max input size in generic mode for altDA. A comment from today indicates that this issue has been addressed in a pull request within the `optimism` repository, prompting a question about closing the current issue.

### op-sync-tester Support for Jovian
The issue [#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18126) focuses on patching the Sync Tester to support Jovian and add Jovian HF tests. A new pull request has been made to address this.

### op-batcher Synchronization with op-node Rollup Config
Discussion on [#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18178) revolves around the `op-batcher`'s static rollup config upon startup, which can lead to issues if the `op-node`'s config changes. Suggestions include making the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher or implementing a mechanism to reload the config when the active endpoint changes. The latest comment highlights the pros and cons of these approaches, noting that explicit provision would require a new batcher release for each Superchain config change, unlike the current system.
