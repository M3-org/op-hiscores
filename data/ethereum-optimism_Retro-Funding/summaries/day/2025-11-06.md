# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Daily Update (Nov 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a critical bug fix for retroactive calculations affecting projects impacted by attestation signer downtime, ensuring accurate reward distribution. Discussions continued on several active issues, including Go 1.25 compatibility and `op-batcher` synchronization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Retroactive Reward Calculation Fix
A bug affecting retroactive reward calculations for projects impacted by attestation signer downtime was fixed. This ensures accurate reward distribution for projects that submitted applications during M7 but faced issues due to the OP Atlas attestation-signer drain.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility
Discussion on [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17060) (cannon: Support go1.25) continued, with the latest comment confirming that the issue affecting MIPS emulation and keccak hashes has been fixed in Go 1.25.4.

### op-batcher Max Frame Size in Generic Mode
On [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17796) (op-batcher [altda]: should not limit max frame size to max input size in generic mode), a recent comment indicated that the issue was addressed in a separate pull request, and the question of closing the issue was raised.

### op-sync-tester Support for Jovian
A pull request was made to address [#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18126) (op-sync-tester: Support Jovian), aiming to patch the Sync Tester to support Jovian and add Jovian HF tests.

### op-batcher Synchronization with op-node Rollup Config
Discussion on [#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18178) (op-batcher: stay in sync with op-node rollup config) explored solutions for the `op-batcher` to stay updated with the `op-node`'s rollup configuration. Suggestions included making the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher or having the batcher reload the config when the active endpoint changes. The trade-offs of these approaches, such as the need for new batcher releases for Superchain Registry config changes, were also considered.
