## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node v1.16.3 Synchronization Issues
Discussions continued regarding the inability of op-node v1.16.3 to synchronize for Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments. The latest comments from geoknee requested more detailed logs and metrics, specifically concerning safe and unsafe heads, and suggested upgrading op-geth to v1.101603.5. J1a-wei provided the current op-geth and op-node versions in use. ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18510))

### New op-spammer Component for Devnets
The discussion around creating a new `op-spammer` component for devnet deployments saw geoknee pointing to `flashbots/contender` as potential prior art. Scharissis further highlighted a specific issue within `contender` that might be relevant. The goal is to have a simple service to periodically send user transactions to catch bugs on devnets. ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18482))

### op-acceptance-tests: sysgo support for flashblocks / rbuilders
The issue of `sysgo` not supporting flashblocks/rbuilders in `op-acceptance-tests` was revisited. Geoknee asked for an update on whether this task is complete, following teddyknox's earlier comment about needing this to validate a `kona-node + rollup-boost` change.
