# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on preparing for the next round of RetroPGF, with draft results for S8-M9 being added for QA. Discussions on active issues covered improvements to `proxyd`'s handling of out-of-sync backends and blob priority fee tracking for `op-batcher/txmgr`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### RetroPGF Data Preparation
Draft results for S8-M9, including various data files for devtooling and onchain metrics, were added for quality assurance. This represents a significant step towards the next RetroPGF round, though backfills for new projects and full QA are still pending.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Proxyd Backend Synchronization Challenges
Discussions on [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/501) explored solutions for `proxyd`'s "backwards time travel" issue when backends are out of sync. Proposed approaches include a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, `proxyd` silently falling back to other backends on "block out of range" errors, and various sticky session implementations (IP-based or signature-based). The latest comments highlight the potential for "backwards time travel" to affect `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory` in addition to `eth_call`.

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking for Batcher
Issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18102) focuses on improving blob priority fee tracking for the `op-batcher/txmgr`. The latest comment suggests that while a simpler approach of decaying priority fees from previous transactions could offer a quick win for handling backlogs, a dedicated blob priority fee tracker would provide a more robust and consistent estimate, especially after restarts.

### Update `migrate` method
Discussion on [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17743) clarified that this issue specifically tracks OPCM changes related to the `migrate` method, with devstack changes being covered by a separate issue. The latest comment indicates that with the OPCM updates, this issue is ready to be closed.

### Flashblocks/Rbuilders Support in op-acceptance-tests
Issue [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16450) addresses the lack of flashblocks/rbuilders awareness in `sysgo` for `op-acceptance-tests`. The latest comment expresses a desire to implement this to validate `kona-node` and `rollup-boost` changes.
