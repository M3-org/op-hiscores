# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on preparing for the next RetroPGF round with the addition of draft results for S8-M9, alongside ongoing discussions on critical infrastructure issues like `proxyd`'s time travel problem and blob priority fee tracking.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### RetroPGF Round 8 - Milestone 9 Draft Results
Draft results for RetroPGF Round 8, Milestone 9 (S8-M9) have been added for QA purposes, including data for devtooling and onchain metrics. These results are pre-backfill for new projects and require further QA. ([#82](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/82))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#83](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/83), was opened to address a retroactive calculation fix for projects affected by downtime from the attestation signer.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Addressing `proxyd`'s Backwards Time Travel
Discussions on [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/501) continued regarding `proxyd`'s ability to "travel back in time" when backends are out of sync. Several approaches were brainstormed, including a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, `proxyd`'s awareness of "block out of range" errors, and IP-based or signature-based sticky sessions. The latest comments highlight the potential broader impact of "backwards time travel" on `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory`, and weigh the pros and cons of each proposed solution, with a preference for approach 1 if traffic allows, or approach 2 for ease of implementation.

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking for `op-batcher/txmgr`
The issue of blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr` ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18102)) saw further discussion. The latest comment suggests that while a "decay" mechanism for starting priority fees could be a quick win to handle backlogs, it would not be as comprehensive as a dedicated blob priority fee tracker. The main drawback of a decay mechanism is that the batcher would start fresh after a restart, which is common during incident handling.

### Updating the `migrate` Method
Discussion on [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17743) clarified that this issue specifically tracks OPCM changes related to the `migrate` method. The latest comment confirms that a separate issue ([#17764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17764)) covers the corresponding devstack changes, suggesting this issue might be ready for closure.

### `op-acceptance-tests`: Sysgo Support for Flashblocks / Rbuilders
A comment on [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16450) expressed the desire to implement sysgo support for flashblocks/rbuilders to validate the `kona-node` and `rollup-boost` changes.
