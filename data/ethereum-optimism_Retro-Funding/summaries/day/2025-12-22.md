### op-node Light Client External Source Following Implemented
The issue regarding the implementation of external following for safe/finalized data in `op-node` using the `--l2.follow.source` flag has been closed [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18317). The `op-node` implementation is now complete, allowing the node to mirror external safe/finalized feeds and reach the safe/finalized tip.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-challenger: Review correct trace output when next super root is not found
Discussion continued on the `op-challenger` issue concerning the correct trace output when the next super root is not found [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18643). The latest comment confirms that the super node trace provider now handles this correctly. While `op-supervisor` will not be fixed due to its impending deletion, the issue remains open pending an integration test to confirm `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments highlighted this as a real problem, noting that `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash on the first chain with insufficient data. There was also a discussion about the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test and the behavior of `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC in `op-supervisor`.
