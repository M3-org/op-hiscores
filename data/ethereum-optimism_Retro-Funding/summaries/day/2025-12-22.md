## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-node` Light Client External Source Following Implemented
The issue concerning the implementation of external following for safe/finalized data in `op-node` using the `--l2.follow.source` flag has been closed [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18317). This indicates that the `op-node` now supports mirroring external safe/finalized feeds, allowing the node to reach the safe/finalized tip.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-challenger`: Review correct trace output when next super root is not found
Discussion continued on the issue regarding `op-challenger`'s trace output when the next super root is not found [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18643). The latest comment confirms that the `super node trace provider` now handles this correctly. While `op-supervisor` is being deprecated, the issue remains open pending an integration test to ensure `op-challenger` and `op-program` align. Earlier comments highlighted this as a real problem, noting that `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash with insufficient data and questioning the correctness of a specific test case. The logic for `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC was also discussed, suggesting it returns a "not found" error if any chain is not supported by L1.
