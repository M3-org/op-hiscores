# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Daily Update (Sep 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The primary focus for the day was on establishing the foundational scaffolding for Season 8 (S8) retro funding calculations, replicating the Season 7 structure with unified tooling to create a generic, season-agnostic framework.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Retro Funding Calculation Scaffolding
- Initial scaffolding for Season 8 (S8) retro funding calculations has been added, mirroring the Season 7 structure. This includes new configuration, data fetching, and processing utilities designed to be season-agnostic. ([#74](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/74))
- Core models for allocators, devtooling, and onchain builders have been introduced or updated to support the new generic framework. ([#74](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/74))
- New query files for S8 have been added alongside existing S7 queries, facilitating data retrieval for both seasons within the unified tooling. ([#74](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/74))

### Kona + Cannon Support in OPCM
Discussion on [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17285) centers on the necessary changes in OPCM to support Kona + Cannon. The latest comment from ajsutton confirms that OPCM will need to support deploying the new game type, specifically highlighting a code block in `contracts-bedrock` that will require updates. Earlier, pauldowman suggested confirming if any changes are needed before closing the issue.

### Kona + Cannon Support in op-dispute-mon
Issue [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17286) addresses the need for `op-dispute-mon` to support Kona + Cannon game types. pauldowman updated the issue description to "Update to support cannon-kona games." ajsutton previously clarified that `dispute-mon` must return an error for unsupported game types and that it will need to be updated to explicitly support cannon-kana game types, rather than just looking at specific game types.
