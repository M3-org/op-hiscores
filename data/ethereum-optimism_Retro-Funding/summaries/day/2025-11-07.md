## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-batcher` Max Frame Size in Generic Mode
Discussion continued on issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17796) regarding the `op-batcher` not limiting max frame size to max input size in generic mode for altDA. A comment from `tessr` on November 6th indicated that the issue was addressed in a previous pull request ([#18074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074)) and questioned if the issue could be closed. `nuke-web3` followed up on November 7th, suggesting that the `specs` document should be updated to reflect this change, as the current specification still states a false limitation regarding `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` for `commitment_type == 0`.
