## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-batcher` Max Frame Size Discussion
Discussions continued on the issue regarding the `op-batcher` not limiting the max frame size to the max input size in generic mode. The latest comment from `nuke-web3` suggests that the Optimism specs might need updating to reflect the current implementation, as the existing spec statement regarding `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` is now considered false. This follows `tessr`'s comment confirming the issue was addressed in a previous pull request. ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17796))
