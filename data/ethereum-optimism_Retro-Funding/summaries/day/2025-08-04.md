## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### M6 Results Snapshot and Metric Adjustments
The repository saw a major update with the M6 results snapshot, which included significant changes to how metrics are calculated and utilized. This involved adding support for PageRank propagation in devtooling project links and adjusting metric variant weights for onchain builders, specifically increasing `growth` and decreasing `retention`. ([#71](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/71))
