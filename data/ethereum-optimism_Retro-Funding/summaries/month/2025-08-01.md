# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
August's development was centered on finalizing the M6 results snapshot for the current RetroPGF season. This involved significant adjustments to metric calculations, including the introduction of PageRank propagation for devtooling links and re-weighting metrics for onchain builders. The team also addressed data integrity by fixing a bug that incorrectly flagged a project with consolidated deployments. Overall, the focus was on refining the data and algorithms to ensure a fair and accurate outcome for the funding round.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on preparing and correcting the M6 results data, alongside routine dependency maintenance.

*   **M6 Results Snapshot and Metric Refinements**
    *   A major update was merged to prepare the M6 results snapshot. This introduced support for PageRank propagation in devtooling project links, enhancing how project influence is measured. Additionally, metric variant weights for onchain builders were adjusted, increasing the importance of `growth` while decreasing `retention` to better reflect current priorities ([#71](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/71)).

*   **Data Correction and Bug Fixes**
    *   A bug was resolved where a project with consolidated deployments was incorrectly re-listed, affecting its on-chain metrics. The fix involved updates to query logic and associated data files to ensure the project was correctly represented in the results ([#73](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/73)).

*   **Dependency Maintenance**
    *   To maintain project health and security, key dependencies were updated. The `protobuf` library was bumped to version 5.29.5 ([#66](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/66)), and `urllib3` was updated to version 2.5.0 ([#67](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/67)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was focused on resolving data-related problems and clarifying past decisions. No new major concerns were raised during this period.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Incorrect Project Flagging:** An issue was raised and resolved concerning the "World Mini Apps" project being inappropriately flagged in the results. This was addressed by the bug fix in PR #73 ([#72](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/72)).
    *   **Dev Tooling Dependencies:** A question regarding the distinction between direct and transitive dependencies in Dev Tooling was formally closed, as the matter had been addressed during the M5 evaluation ([#49](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/49)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   No new issues were opened in the observed timeframe, and no existing issues saw significant discussion.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development activity observed this month suggests a focused, internal effort to finalize the M6 results. Issues were reported and resolved quickly by the core team, as seen with the rapid resolution of the incorrectly flagged project ([#72](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/72)). The provided reports do not indicate broader community discussions or contributions during this period, highlighting a phase of concentrated, heads-down work on data integrity and algorithm refinement.
