# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
Development in June focused entirely on investigation, discussion, and planning rather than code implementation. No new features or fixes were merged. Instead, significant effort was directed toward diagnosing critical stability issues within core components like `op-node` and `op-supervisor`. Key discussions centered on resolving stuck goroutines and event overflows, improving release pipeline automation, and clarifying the roles of different developer testing environments. This period laid the essential groundwork for future stability improvements and process refinements across the project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no pull requests were merged this month, progress was made through active investigation and planning within key issues:

- **`op-supervisor` Stability Investigation:** To address an event overflow issue ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16335)), a diagnostic approach was proposed. A pull request ([#16473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16473)) was opened to add a gauge for in-flight events, aiming to pinpoint which event type is causing the overflow during large unsafe head gaps. Another related PR ([#16471](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16471)) suggested adding a counter per event type for debugging.

- **Testing Infrastructure Setup:** Progress was made on enabling comprehensive acceptance testing in persistent devnets ([#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/398)). A key update was the addition of L1 Faucet support via a related pull request ([#16423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16423)), an important step for creating a robust testing environment.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed in June, and no new issues were opened. All activity was concentrated on diagnosing and discussing existing problems.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Node Stability:** The most critical active discussions revolved around node stability. Issue [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16332) highlighted thousands of stuck goroutines in `op-node` v1.13.3, with community members providing detailed stack traces to aid the investigation. Simultaneously, issue [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16335) saw extensive discussion to diagnose an `op-supervisor` event overflow, leading to proposals for adding new metrics to identify the root cause.
    - **Release & Developer Tooling:** Efforts to streamline processes were evident. In [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16097), a lighter-weight solution using `git cliff` was suggested for automating changelog generation. In [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/399), contributors worked to clarify the distinction and primary use cases for `supersim` versus Kurtosis devnets for local multi-chain application testing.
    - **Configuration and Error Handling:** A discussion in [#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/15765) concluded that the `op-deployer` tooling is sufficient for preventing incorrect `CrossL2Inbox` genesis configurations, avoiding the need for additional validation in the execution client. Separately, issue [#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/725) was activated to begin the process of adding missing Super DA (Data Availability) error codes.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was characterized by in-depth technical discussions within GitHub issues. Team members (`nonsense`, `sebastianst`, `axelKingsley`, `ajsutton`) and community contributors (`Creamers158`) worked together to diagnose complex problems.

A notable example of community collaboration was in issue [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16332), where `Creamers158` confirmed a reported `op-node` bug and provided a detailed stack trace, which is invaluable for debugging. The discussions around `op-supervisor` ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16335)) and developer tooling ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/399)) also demonstrated a healthy, collaborative environment focused on identifying the best path forward before implementing changes.
