# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
November's development was centered on advancing the RetroPGF process and enhancing the robustness of core OP Stack components. Significant progress was made in preparing for the next funding round with the addition of draft and final results for recent cycles. A critical bug fix was deployed to ensure fair retroactive reward calculations for projects affected by past infrastructure downtime. Meanwhile, active technical discussions focused on improving the reliability and synchronization of key services like `op-batcher` and `proxyd`, signaling a continued commitment to the stability and performance of the Superchain ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month focused on data preparation for RetroPGF and essential maintenance.

- **RetroPGF Data & Corrections:**
  - Draft results for the S8-M9 cycle, including data for devtooling and on-chain metrics, were added for quality assurance, marking a key step toward the next round ([#82](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/82)).
  - The latest results for the M9 (October 2025) funding round were also integrated into the repository ([#84](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/84)).
  - A bug affecting retroactive reward calculations was fixed, ensuring correct M7 and M8 rewards for a project impacted by attestation signer downtime ([#83](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/83)).

- **Repository Maintenance:**
  - Project dependencies were updated to their latest versions, ensuring the codebase remains current and secure ([#85](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/85)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month saw the resolution of a flaky test and active discussions on improving core infrastructure components.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - A long-standing flaky test, `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor`, was closed after no longer appearing in frequent failure reports, improving CI stability ([#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17548)).
  - An issue tracking an audit for OPCM changes was closed, as its scope is now covered by a broader issue in the main `optimism` repository ([#17371](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17371)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **`op-batcher` Enhancements:** Several active discussions centered on improving the `op-batcher`:
    - **Configuration Sync ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18178)):** A key discussion is underway regarding how the `op-batcher` should handle configuration changes from `op-node`, weighing the trade-offs between explicit configuration updates and a dynamic reloading mechanism.
    - **Blob Fee Tracking ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18102)):** The team is exploring methods to improve blob priority fee tracking, considering both a simple decay-based model and a more robust dedicated tracker.
    - **Spec Alignment ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17796)):** Following a bug fix, a discussion emerged about the need to update the Optimism specifications to accurately reflect the current implementation of max frame size limits.
  - **`proxyd` Reliability ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/501)):** An ongoing conversation aims to solve the "backwards time travel" issue that occurs when `proxyd` backends are out of sync. Proposed solutions include multicall strategies and various sticky session implementations.
  - **Tooling & Compatibility:**
    - It was confirmed that a fix for an incorrect keccak hash issue affecting Cannon was included in Go 1.25.4 ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17060)).
    - Work is in progress to add Jovian hard fork support to the `op-sync-tester` ([#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18126)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident in the deep technical discussions surrounding core infrastructure challenges. The active debates on issues like `op-batcher` synchronization ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18178)) and `proxyd` backend handling ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/501)) highlight a collaborative effort to architect robust, long-term solutions. The feedback loop between implementation and specification, as seen in the `op-batcher` frame size discussion ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17796)), demonstrates a healthy process for evolving the protocol. Furthermore, the quick resolution of the retroactive rewards bug ([#83](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/83)) shows a strong responsiveness to issues that impact the broader ecosystem.
