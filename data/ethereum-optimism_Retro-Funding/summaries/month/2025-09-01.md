# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September's efforts focused on preparing for the future of Retroactive Public Goods Funding while simultaneously advancing the core protocol's fault-proof system. Foundational scaffolding was established for the upcoming Season 8 (S8) calculations, with an emphasis on creating a generic, season-agnostic framework to streamline future rounds. Concurrently, significant discussion and planning took place around integrating the new `cannon-kona` fault-proof game type, a critical step for enhancing the security and decentralization of the OP Stack. These parallel efforts highlight a dual focus on both the application layer of public goods funding and the deep infrastructure that secures the network.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on building the next generation of the Retro Funding framework and ensuring the accuracy of existing data.

- **Season 8 Calculation Scaffolding:** Initial work was completed to prepare for the next round of Retro Funding. This involved creating the foundational structure for S8 calculations by replicating and generalizing the Season 7 setup. The new, season-agnostic framework includes updated configurations, data fetching utilities, and core models for allocators and builders, designed to support both S7 and S8 data within a unified toolset ([#74](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/74)).

- **Bug Fixes & Data Integrity:** A critical bug was addressed where monthly summary metrics for Enso were missing from the S7/M6 results file. This fix ensures the accuracy and completeness of the on-chain results data ([#75](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/75)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Discussions this month revolved around significant upcoming technical upgrades, developer experience improvements, and protocol-level bug resolution.

- **Closed Issues:** An issue regarding a persistent `GameAlreadyExists` error in `op-proposer` was resolved ([#17042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17042)). The investigation concluded that this is expected behavior when the safe head has not advanced, and the resolution involves ensuring the batcher is running correctly.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Kona + Cannon Integration:** A major topic of discussion was the work required to support the new `cannon-kona` game type across the stack. This includes updating `op-dispute-mon` to explicitly recognize and handle the new game type ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17286)) and modifying OPCM contracts to enable deployment of this new game type ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17285)). This represents significant future work for the fault-proof system.
    - **CI/CD & Testing Improvements:** Conversations are ongoing to enhance the developer experience by improving the CircleCI configuration, with ideas to enable easier local execution of high-value tests ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17184)). Additionally, the sync-tester's scope was identified for expansion to cover all Hardfork transitions and multi-client syncing to improve test robustness ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16703)).
    - **P2P Configuration Bug:** A bug was identified where the `ConfigureGossip` function overwrites default P2P settings with zero values, causing panics in certain tests. The active discussion is exploring the best way to establish valid default configurations ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17308)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly visible in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. Team members like `ajsutton` and `pauldowman` were instrumental in clarifying requirements and driving progress on the complex integration of Kona and Cannon fault proofs. The active dialogue around improving CI/CD and testing infrastructure also points to a healthy internal focus on developer productivity and code quality. These discussions, spanning multiple components of the OP Stack, demonstrate strong cross-team coordination on key technical priorities.
