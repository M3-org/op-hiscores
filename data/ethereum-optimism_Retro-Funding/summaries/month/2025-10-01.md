# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Monthly Report (October 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Development in October focused on foundational preparations for the RetroPGF results dashboard. The primary effort involved enhancing the testing infrastructure to ensure stability and accuracy ahead of the official data release. This preparatory work centered on populating the system with comprehensive sample data, a crucial step for validating the dashboard's functionality and data presentation.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month was concentrated on ensuring the reliability of the project's testing environment.

- **Dashboard Testing Infrastructure:**

This included a variety of data files covering devtooling metrics, onchain metrics, output results, and weight configurations. This effort, captured in PR [#78](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/78), was explicitly for testing purposes to validate the dashboard before the official results were locked.
