# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Development in early December centered on finalizing the results for RetroPGF Season 8, with significant effort dedicated to refining the weighting for onchain builders. Concurrently, the team engaged in critical discussions around core infrastructure, addressing an `op-node` synchronization issue impacting multiple chains and planning for a new `op-spammer` component to improve devnet testing. The period was also marked by strong community engagement, with new contributors actively seeking to resolve open issues.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month focused on refining the RetroPGF process and performing routine maintenance.

- **RetroPGF Season 8 Results Refinement**
  A series of updates were made to prepare the results for Milestone 10. This included adding draft results and updated queries ([#86](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/86)), followed by several adjustments to the weights for onchain builders to fine-tune the final outcomes ([#87](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/87), [#88](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/88)).

- **General Maintenance**
  Routine upkeep included updating the `urllib3` dependency ([#89](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/89)) and maintaining the project's changelog ([#90](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/90)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on resolving long-standing items and triaging active, high-priority infrastructure challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
  A long-standing documentation issue regarding the visibility of the theme-switcher button in light mode was closed, with the fix attributed to a recent framework switch ([#1752](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/1752)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  No new issues were opened, but several active discussions pointed to significant ongoing and future work:
    - **`op-node` Synchronization Failure:** A critical issue ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18510)) where `op-node v1.16.3` fails to synchronize for Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments remains a top priority. Maintainers requested more detailed logs and recommended an `op-geth` upgrade to help diagnose the problem.
    - **Devnet Tooling:** Discussions continued on creating a new `op-spammer` component ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18482)) to periodically send transactions on devnets for bug detection, with `flashbots/contender` being evaluated as potential prior art.
    - **Test Support:** An older issue ([#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16450)) regarding the need for `sysgo` to support flashblocks/rbuilders in acceptance tests was revisited, as it is a dependency for validating other changes.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The period saw notable engagement from the community. One contributor, Himess, showed significant initiative by expressing interest in taking on five separate issues ([#9697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/9697), [#13435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/13435), [#13436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/13436), [#15220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/15220), [#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18479)), ranging from contract function definitions to test setup failures. This proactive involvement highlights a healthy and accessible environment for new contributors. Meanwhile, maintainers collaborated closely on technical issues, such as the `op-node` synchronization problem and the design of the new `op-spammer` component.
