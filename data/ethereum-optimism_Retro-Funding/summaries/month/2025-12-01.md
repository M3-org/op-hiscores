# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Development in early December centered on finalizing the results for RetroPGF Season 8, Milestone 10, with a series of refinements to data queries and weightings for onchain builders. Alongside this, significant attention was given to critical infrastructure challenges, including ongoing investigations into `op-node` synchronization failures and discussions around improving devnet tooling with a new `op-spammer` component. The period was also marked by strong community engagement, with contributors actively participating in issue triage and expressing interest in tackling open tasks.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this period focused on refining the RetroPGF S8 results and performing routine maintenance.

- **RetroPGF Season 8, Milestone 10 Refinements:**
  The primary effort was on preparing the final results for the latest RetroPGF milestone. This involved adding draft results and updated data queries ([#86](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/86)), followed by several adjustments to the weights assigned to onchain builders to ensure fair and accurate allocation ([#87](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/87), [#88](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/88)).

- **Maintenance and Dependencies:**
  General project upkeep included updating the changelog to maintain an accurate project history ([#90](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/90)) and bumping the `urllib3` dependency to a new version ([#89](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/89)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Discussions were active around core node stability and developer tooling, while a long-standing documentation issue was closed.

- **Closed Issues:**
  A documentation UI issue regarding the visibility of the theme-switcher button in light mode was closed ([#1752](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/1752)), with the resolution attributed to a recent framework switch.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  No new issues were opened, but several active discussions pointed to key areas of focus:
    - **`op-node` Synchronization Issues:** An important investigation continued into why `op-node` v1.16.3 fails to synchronize for multiple chains ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18510)). Maintainers requested more detailed logs and suggested an `op-geth` upgrade to aid in troubleshooting.
    - **Devnet Tooling (`op-spammer`):** A proposal to create a new `op-spammer` component to send transactions on devnets and catch bugs gained traction ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18482)). The discussion pointed towards `flashbots/contender` as potential prior art for the implementation.
    - **Devnet Warning Clarification:** A user-reported issue about "invalid block signature" warnings on a local devnet ([#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/1898)) was clarified; these warnings are expected and not problematic for local development environments.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The period saw notable community activity and collaborative problem-solving.

- **New Contributor Interest:** Community member "Himess" showed significant initiative by expressing interest in contributing to a wide range of open issues, including contract comment discrepancies ([#13435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/13435), [#13436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/13436)), test setup failures ([#15220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/15220)), and Go-based changes ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18479)).

- **Collaborative Triage:** Issues like the `op-node` synchronization problem ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18510)) and the `op-spammer` proposal ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18482)) demonstrated healthy collaboration, with multiple contributors like "geoknee," "j1a-wei," and "scharissis" working together to diagnose problems and evaluate solutions.
