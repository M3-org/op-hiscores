# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on enhancing the RetroPGF evaluation process and improving core developer tooling. The most significant development was the integration of M7 data and weights, a key step forward for the next round of public goods funding analysis. Alongside this, work continued on improving the developer experience with a new utility for downloading project logos and active discussions around local build capabilities for `op-geth`. Key issues related to `op-batcher` metrics and `op-geth` genesis handling were also resolved, strengthening the stability and observability of the OP Stack.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on preparing for RetroPGF evaluations and refining the underlying infrastructure.

- **RetroPGF Data Integration and Tooling:**
  - New data and weights for M7 were integrated into the evaluation algorithms and results files, directly impacting both devtooling and onchain metric calculations ([#77](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/77)).
  - A new utility was added to the `eval-algos/core` directory to facilitate downloading project logos, improving the data collection and presentation capabilities of the evaluation tooling ([#76](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/76)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
This week saw the resolution of key infrastructure issues and continued discussion on developer experience improvements.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **`op-geth` Stability:** An issue causing a LevelDB panic in `op-geth` when initializing with large genesis files was resolved. The fix involves importing the state into the database rather than storing the `genesis.json` as a flat blob, mirroring the process used by `op-mainnet` ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/668)).
  - **`op-batcher` Observability:** An improvement was made to the `op-batcher`'s throttling intensity metric. The corresponding Grafana dashboard will now only plot values greater than zero, making it easier to identify active controllers ([#17149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17149)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were opened this week.
  - **Developer Tooling:** Discussion is ongoing in issue [#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16975) about enabling Kurtosis to use a local `op-geth` build. Suggestions include leveraging the templating system to automatically override the image or allowing the temporary cloning and local building of a Docker image.
  - **Data Documentation:** A minor update was noted in issue [#762](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/762), which documents builder addresses that have received mainnet ETH funding.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was focused on technical problem-solving and improving the developer environment. The active discussion around enabling local `op-geth` builds within Kurtosis ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16975)) highlights the community's focus on refining development workflows. While there were no major multi-contributor threads, the steady progress on infrastructure issues and data integration demonstrates ongoing, focused collaboration.
