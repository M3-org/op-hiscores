# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Weekly Report (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development activity was characterized by focused investigation and collaborative problem-solving within existing issues, rather than new feature implementation or code merges. No new pull requests were opened or merged. Key discussions centered on diagnosing critical stability issues, including a goroutine leak in `op-node`'s P2P sync client and an event overflow in `op-supervisor`. Efforts also continued to refine release automation and clarify the roles of different testing environments, laying the groundwork for future development and stability improvements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features, bug fixes, or other code changes were merged this week. All development activity occurred within issue discussions, focusing on analysis and planning for future work.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were opened or closed this week. The focus remained on diagnosing and discussing several high-priority active issues.

**New & Active Issues:**

*   **`op-node` & `op-supervisor` Stability:**
    *   **`op-node` Goroutine Leak ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16332)):** A user confirmed they are experiencing the previously reported issue of stuck goroutines in `op-node` v1.13.3, providing a detailed stack trace. This confirms the persistence of a significant stability problem related to the P2P synchronization client.
    *   **`op-supervisor` Event Overflow ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16335)):** Investigation into event overflow during large unsafe head gaps continued. A plan was formulated to add a gauge for in-flight events ([#16473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16473)) to pinpoint which event type is causing the backlog, moving the diagnosis forward.

*   **Tooling and Testing Infrastructure:**
    *   **Release Pipeline Automation ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16097)):** A discussion around improving release changelogs led to a suggestion to use the lighter-weight `git cliff` tool, indicating an ongoing effort to streamline release processes.
    *   **Testing Environments ([#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/398), [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/399)):** Progress was noted in setting up persistent devnets with the addition of L1 Faucet support. A clarifying discussion distinguished `supersim` as a lightweight tool for local multi-chain application testing, in contrast to the more robust Kurtosis devnets used for testing the chains themselves.

*   **Protocol Configuration and Errors:**
    *   **Genesis Configuration ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/15765)):** A key discussion concluded that adding `CrossL2Inbox` validation to the execution client is unnecessary, as the existing `op-deployer` tooling already mitigates the risk of misconfiguration.
    *   **Super DA Errors ([#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/725)):** The issue of adding missing Super DA error codes was brought back to the forefront by tagging relevant team members for attention.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly visible within issue threads this week. The investigation into the `op-supervisor` event overflow ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16335)) involved active discussion between several contributors, including `sebastianst`, `axelKingsley`, and `nonsense`, who built upon each other's findings to form a diagnostic plan. Community involvement was also crucial, as seen in the `op-node` stability issue ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16332)), where user `Creamers158` provided a valuable stack trace that confirmed the bug. This highlights a healthy dynamic of both internal team collaboration and external community feedback driving the project's problem-solving efforts.
