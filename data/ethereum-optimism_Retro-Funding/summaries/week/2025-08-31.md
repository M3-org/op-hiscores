# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on advancing the Retro Public Goods Funding framework and preparing for future protocol upgrades. Significant progress was made by establishing the foundational scaffolding for Season 8 calculations, designed with a season-agnostic approach to streamline future rounds. A key data integrity bug in Season 7's metrics was also resolved. Concurrently, active discussions focused on the integration of Kona and Cannon game types, highlighting the necessary updates across multiple components like `op-dispute-mon` and OPCM to support the new fault-proof system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on building out the next iteration of the retro funding calculation engine and ensuring the accuracy of past results.

- **Retro Funding Calculation Framework:**
  - Initial scaffolding for Season 8 (S8) retro funding calculations was introduced, mirroring the Season 7 structure but with unified, season-agnostic tooling. This includes new configurations, data fetching utilities, and core models for allocators and builders, setting the stage for a more generic framework ([#74](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/74)).
  - A bug was fixed to correct missing Enso monthly summary metrics from the `onchain__results.json` file for Season 7, Month 6, ensuring the accuracy of historical data reporting ([#75](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/75)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving a proposer error and engaging in deep discussions around upcoming protocol features and tooling improvements.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - An issue regarding a persistent `GameAlreadyExists` error in `op-proposer` was closed. It was clarified that this error is expected when the safe head hasn't advanced, and the resolution involves ensuring the batcher is running correctly ([#17042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17042)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Kona + Cannon Integration:** A major topic of discussion was the work required to support the new `cannon-kona` game type. This involves updates to `op-dispute-mon` to prevent errors with unsupported game types ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17286)) and changes in OPCM to handle the deployment of the new game type ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17285)).
  - **Tooling & Test Infrastructure:** Several issues highlighted a focus on improving developer experience and test reliability.
    - A bug in the P2P gossip configuration was identified where sane defaults were being overwritten with zero values, causing test panics ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17308)).
    - Discussions continued on enhancing the CircleCI configuration for better local testability and user experience ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17184)).
    - The sync-tester issue was reopened to ensure all Hardfork transitions are properly tested ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/16703)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was prominent in issue discussions, indicating a period of active planning and problem-solving. The integration of Kona and Cannon, for instance, saw detailed exchanges between team members to clarify requirements across different parts of the stack, such as `op-dispute-mon` and `contracts-bedrock`. Similarly, the conversations around improving CI/CD and testing infrastructure show a collective effort to enhance the internal development loop and maintain a high standard of code quality and reliability. While the number of merged pull requests was small, the depth of technical discussion in active issues points to significant foundational work being laid for future development.
