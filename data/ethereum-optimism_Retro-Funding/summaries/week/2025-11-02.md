# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on preparing for the next round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding. The primary achievement was the addition of draft results for RetroPGF Round 8, Milestone 9, which are now ready for quality assurance. Alongside this, significant discussions continued on core infrastructure challenges, particularly focused on resolving a "time travel" issue in `proxyd` and determining the best approach for tracking blob priority fees in the `op-batcher`.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Progress this week focused on data preparation for the upcoming RetroPGF round and addressing data integrity.

*   **RetroPGF Round 8 Data Preparation**
    *   Draft results for RetroPGF Round 8, Milestone 9 (S8-M9) were added to the repository for QA purposes. This includes initial data for devtooling and onchain metrics, though it is noted as being pre-backfill for new projects ([#82](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/82)).

*   **Data Calculation Fixes**
    *   A new pull request was opened to implement a retroactive calculation fix for projects that were affected by downtime from the attestation signer, ensuring data accuracy ([#83](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/83)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No issues were closed or newly created this week based on the provided reports. However, active discussions progressed on several key technical challenges.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **`proxyd` Synchronization (`#501`):** Discussions continued on how to handle `proxyd`'s ability to "travel back in time" when backends are out of sync. Proposed solutions being weighed include a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, making `proxyd` aware of "block out of range" errors, and implementing IP-based or signature-based sticky sessions. The potential impact on `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory` is also being considered.
    *   **Blob Priority Fee Tracking (`#18102`):** The conversation around tracking blob priority fees in `op-batcher/txmgr` advanced. While a "decay" mechanism for starting fees was suggested as a quick win, the consensus is leaning towards a more comprehensive, dedicated blob priority fee tracker that would be more resilient to batcher restarts.
    *   **Acceptance Testing (`#16450`):** A need was expressed to implement sysgo support for flashblocks/rbuilders to help validate `kona-node` and `rollup-boost` changes.
    *   **Issue Maintenance (`#17743`):** It was clarified that an issue tracking OPCM changes for the `migrate` method may be ready for closure, as the related devstack changes are being handled in a separate issue ([#17764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17764)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week's activity highlighted deep collaborative problem-solving on complex infrastructure issues. The detailed brainstorming and weighing of pros and cons in issues like the `proxyd` time travel problem ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/501)) and blob priority fee tracking ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18102)) demonstrate a focused effort by the team to find robust, long-term solutions. Additionally, the coordination seen in clarifying the scope of issue [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/17743) points to healthy project management practices aimed at preventing duplicated work.
