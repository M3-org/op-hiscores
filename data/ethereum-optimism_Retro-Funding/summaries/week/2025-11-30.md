# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Weekly Report (Nov 30 - 6, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on finalizing the results for RetroPGF Season 8, Round 10 (M10), with several pull requests dedicated to adding draft results and refining the weights for onchain builders. On the operational front, a critical investigation into `op-node` v1.16.3 synchronization failures is underway, with maintainers and users collaborating to diagnose the issue. The period was also marked by strong community engagement, as multiple contributors expressed interest in tackling a variety of open issues.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on data refinement for the current RetroPGF round and routine dependency maintenance.

- **RetroPGF M10 Results Refinement**
  Significant progress was made in preparing the results for the tenth milestone of RetroPGF Season 8. Draft results for both the devtooling and onchain categories were added, including new data and updated queries ([#86](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/86)). Following this, a series of adjustments were made to fine-tune the weights for onchain builders, ensuring the results are accurately calculated ([#87](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/87), [#88](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/88)).

- **Dependency Management**
  A routine dependency update was merged to bump `urllib3` from version 2.5.0 to 2.6.0 ([#89](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/89)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Discussions this week were concentrated on resolving an active node synchronization problem and planning for future tooling, while a minor UI issue was closed.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - A long-standing UI issue regarding the visibility of the theme-switcher button text in light mode ([#1752](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/1752)) was closed. It is believed that a recent framework switch has resolved the problem.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **`op-node` Synchronization Failure (#18510):** A key active issue involves users experiencing synchronization failures after upgrading `op-node` to v1.16.3. Users provided specific `op-geth` and `op-node` docker image versions being used. A maintainer suggested the logged error may not be unusual after a restart, requested more detailed logs, and recommended upgrading `op-geth` to v1.101603.5 as a potential fix.
  - **Proposed `op-spammer` Component (#18482):** Discussion continued on the proposal to create a new `op-spammer` component for sending transactions on devnets to help catch bugs. Multiple community members suggested looking at `flashbots/contender` as prior art for this effort.
  - **`op-acceptance-tests` Status (#16450):** A contributor inquired about the completion status of an issue related to the `sysgo` orchestrator's lack of awareness of flashblocks in `op-acceptance-tests`.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The period saw notable activity from the contributor community, signaling healthy engagement with the project.

- **Contributor Initiative:** Community member "Himess" showed significant interest in contributing, inquiring about the status of and expressing readiness to work on several open issues, including a contract function view discrepancy ([#9697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/9697)), comment inconsistencies in `MIPS64Memory.sol` ([#13435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/13435), [#13436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/13436)), a test setup failure ([#15220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/15220)), and another task estimated to require changes across five files ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18479)).
- **Collaborative Troubleshooting:** The discussion around the `op-node` synchronization issue ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18510)) exemplifies effective collaboration, with users providing detailed environment information and maintainers offering diagnostic steps and potential solutions.
