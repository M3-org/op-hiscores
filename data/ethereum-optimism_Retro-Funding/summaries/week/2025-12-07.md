# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This was a quiet week focused on project maintenance and clarifying technical issues for developers. The primary activity involved a routine update to the project's changelog. Additionally, an important clarification was provided for an active issue, assuring developers that certain `op-node` warnings encountered during local devnet deployments are expected and not indicative of a problem.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week was centered on maintaining project documentation and history.

*   **Changelog Maintenance:** A chore was completed to update the changelog, ensuring that the project's release history remains accurate and up-to-date ([#90](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/90)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed this week. Triage activity was focused on providing clarity on an existing issue.

*   **New & Active Issues:** Discussion on issue [#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/1898) provided key clarification for developers. It was confirmed that warnings like "failed to publish newly created block" and "invalid block signature" seen in `op-node` when using `create-l2-rollup-example` are not problematic for local devnet environments. These warnings occur because the node's peer does not recognize the block signature in a local setup where the P2P network is not fully configured.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Based on the week's activity, collaboration was focused and specific. The discussion on issue [#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/1898) demonstrates a commitment to supporting developers by clarifying potential points of confusion in the local development experience. Overall, it was a period of low-intensity maintenance rather than broad community interaction.
