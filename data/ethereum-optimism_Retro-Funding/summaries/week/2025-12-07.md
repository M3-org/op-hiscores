# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on project maintenance and providing clarity for developers. A key discussion resolved ambiguity around `op-node` warnings in local devnet environments, confirming they are not problematic and are an expected part of the local setup. This clarification is valuable for anyone using the `create-l2-rollup-example`. Additionally, routine maintenance was performed to keep the project's changelog current.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on maintaining project documentation and history.

- **Changelog Maintenance:** A chore was completed to update the project's changelog, ensuring an accurate and up-to-date record of changes is maintained for all contributors and users ([#90](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/90)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management was focused on clarifying existing developer questions rather than addressing new bugs or features.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. An important discussion took place on an active issue ([#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/1898)) concerning `op-node` warnings observed during local devnet deployments. It was clarified that warnings like "failed to publish newly created block" and "invalid block signature" are expected behavior. These occur because the local `op-node` attempts to publish to a P2P network where the peer does not recognize the block signature, and this is not a concern for local development.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community interaction this week was focused and technical. The discussion on issue [#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/1898) served as a point of collaboration, providing helpful context that improves the developer experience for those setting up local test environments.
