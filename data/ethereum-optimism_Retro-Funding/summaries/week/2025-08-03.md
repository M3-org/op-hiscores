# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Weekly Report (Aug 3 - 9, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on finalizing and correcting data for the M6 results snapshot. Key developments included significant updates to metric calculations, such as adjusting weights for onchain builders and adding PageRank propagation for devtooling project links. A critical bug fix was implemented to correctly handle a project with consolidated deployments that had been inappropriately flagged, ensuring the integrity of the results data. The week also included routine dependency updates, reflecting a period of data refinement and stabilization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on preparing the M6 results data and addressing related bugs.

-   **M6 Results Snapshot and Metric Adjustments**
    -   A major update prepared the repository for the M6 results snapshot. This introduced support for PageRank propagation in devtooling project links and adjusted metric variant weights for onchain builders by increasing `growth` and decreasing `retention` ([#71](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/71)).

-   **Data Correction for Flagged Project**
    -   A bug was fixed where a project with consolidated deployments was incorrectly re-listed, affecting on-chain metrics. The fix involved updates to `eval-algos/S7/utils/queries.py` and several data and output files to ensure accurate project representation ([#73](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/73)).

-   **Dependency Maintenance**
    -   The project's dependencies were updated to maintain security and stability. `protobuf` was bumped to version 5.29.5 ([#66](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/66)) and `urllib3` was upgraded to version 2.5.0 ([#67](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/67)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was focused on resolving data-related problems and clarifying past decisions.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Project Flagging:** An issue regarding the "World Mini Apps" project being inappropriately flagged in the Retro-Funding results was resolved ([#72](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/72)). The fix was implemented in PR #73.
    -   **Dev Tooling Dependencies:** A question about the distinction between direct and transitive dependencies in Dev Tooling was closed, as the matter had been addressed during M5 ([#49](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/49)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   No new issues were opened this week.
    -   There were no active issues with significant discussion (more than 3 comments).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development activity this week was focused and efficient, with no extensive discussions noted on pull requests or issues. The quick resolution of the inappropriately flagged project issue ([#72](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/72)) suggests effective internal communication and a focus on data integrity. The remainder of the week was quiet, with no new pull requests or issues opened, indicating a period of stabilization following the M6 data preparations.
