# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on strengthening the foundational design and documentation of the OP Stack. Significant progress was made with the introduction of a detailed architecture document for the new Kona Rollup Node and an initial design for an enshrined revenue-sharing mechanism. Concurrently, the team enhanced system resilience through failure mode analysis and resolved key integration issues related to Flashblocks. An important technical discussion is ongoing regarding the reliability of the dispute monitoring service when handling out-of-sync nodes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this period centered on documenting new architecture, refining protocol economics, and improving system security analysis.

- **Protocol Design & Architecture Documentation:**
  - A comprehensive architecture document for the `kona-node` (Kona Rollup Node) was introduced, outlining its design and providing a comparison to the existing `op-node` with diagrams ([#264](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/264)).
  - An initial design document for revenue sharing was proposed, detailing how the fee split predeploy will be enshrined in the OP Stack to manage protocol revenue ([#309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/309)).

- **Security and Failure Mode Analysis (FMA):**
  - The generic failure mode documentation was updated to better analyze a "Chain split driven by L1 chain split" scenario ([#347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/347), [#348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/348)).
  - A new pull request was opened to add FMA for an operator fee fix, continuing the focus on proactive security analysis ([#349](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/349)).

- **Documentation Maintenance & Future Work:**
  - Several dead or broken links were removed from the documentation to improve user experience ([#345](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/345), [#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/346)).
  - A new feature PR was opened to add an upgrade path, signaling forward-looking planning ([#350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/350)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on resolving integration problems and clarifying the behavior of monitoring tools. No new issues were opened during this period.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks Integration:** Two key issues were resolved. A problem causing loss of Flashblocks due to proxy connectivity and timeout issues was fixed ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17856)). Successful coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers to integrate the new RPC node was also completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17857)).
  - **Protocol Specifications:** An issue to update the DA footprint block limit specs was closed ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/792)), and another related to the dispute game implementation was also resolved ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17257)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - A significant discussion is ongoing in **[#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17814)** regarding how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync rollup RPCs. The current proposal is to use the `syncStatus` to validate if a node is sufficiently in sync, rather than relying on potentially incorrect L2 block heights. This would improve the monitor's ability to distinguish between a legitimate fork and a lagging node.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
- The resolution of the Flashblocks RPC node issue ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17857)) highlights effective collaboration with external ecosystem partners, including RPC providers and Blockscout.
- The active discussion on the `op-dispute-mon` issue ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17814)) demonstrates focused technical debate within the team to ensure the robustness of critical monitoring infrastructure.
