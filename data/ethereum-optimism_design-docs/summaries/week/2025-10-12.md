# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on advancing core protocol architecture and enhancing system resilience. Significant progress was made with the introduction of a new architecture document for the Kona Rollup Node and a design proposal for on-chain revenue sharing. Concurrently, the team worked on improving security through failure mode analysis and resolved key operational issues related to Flashblocks integration. An important discussion is ongoing regarding the reliability of the dispute monitoring service, highlighting a continued focus on network stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on introducing new protocol designs, strengthening security documentation, and performing routine maintenance.

- **Protocol Architecture & Design:**
  - A comprehensive architecture document for the `kona-node` (Kona Rollup Node) was added, providing detailed design specifications and diagrams comparing it to the existing `op-node` ([#264](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/264)).
  - An initial design document for revenue sharing was introduced, outlining how the fee split predeploy will be enshrined within the OP Stack ([#309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/309)).

- **Security and Failure Mode Analysis (FMA):**
  - The documentation for handling "Chain split driven by L1 chain split" failure modes was updated ([#347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/347), [#348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/348)).
  - A new pull request was opened to add FMA for an operator fee fix ([#349](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/349)), continuing the effort to proactively document and mitigate potential risks.

- **Proposed Features & Maintenance:**
  - A new proposal was opened to add an upgrade path to the system ([#350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/350)).
  - Minor documentation cleanup was performed by removing dead links to improve user experience ([#345](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/345), [#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/346)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened this week, while several important existing issues were resolved and one key discussion remains active.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks Integration:** Two critical issues related to Flashblocks were resolved. A connectivity problem causing loss of Flashblocks was fixed by upgrading the `Flashblocks-websocket-proxy` ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17856)), and coordination with external RPC providers for the new Flashblocks RPC node was successfully completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17857)).
  - **Protocol Specification:** An issue regarding the DA footprint block limit specs was closed after being updated with the latest design ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/792)). The issue to use the v2 dispute game implementation was also closed ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17257)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Dispute Monitoring Reliability:** There is an ongoing discussion in [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17814) on how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync rollup RPCs. The conversation is converging on a solution to use the `syncStatus` and the highest unsafe block across all nodes to determine the correct L2 head, rather than relying on potentially incorrect fork data from a single node. This discussion is critical for ensuring the robustness of the network's dispute monitoring capabilities.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted effective collaboration with external ecosystem partners. The successful resolution of the Flashblocks RPC coordination issue ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17857)) demonstrated strong communication with RPC providers, including Blockscout. Internally, the detailed technical discussion on the `op-dispute-mon` issue ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17814)) shows active engagement from the team in collaboratively solving complex engineering challenges.
