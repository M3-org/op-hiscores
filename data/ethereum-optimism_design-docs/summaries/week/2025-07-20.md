# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity was centered on the design phase for enhancing the operational stability of the Superchain. All efforts were concentrated on a single, detailed discussion to define a comprehensive monitoring and alerting strategy for flashblocks. This foundational design work aims to improve reliability by establishing clear metrics and service-level agreements (SLAs) for critical components like peer connectivity, block progression, and transaction processing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No pull requests were merged this week, as the focus was on design and planning rather than implementation. The work consisted entirely of discussions to scope out future development.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed this week, with all activity focused on a single ongoing discussion.

- **New & Active Issues:** The primary focus was the ongoing discussion in **[#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16388) - Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerting Improvements**. Key specifications were outlined for a new monitoring framework, including:
    - **Peer Count:** A minimum threshold of 4 peers.
    - **Block Progression:** Defining SLAs for block progression and divergence.
    - **Pending Transactions:** Alerting when pending transactions exceed a threshold (approx. 60).
    - **Flashblocks SLA:** A new SLA-like metric using `reth_op_rbuilder_total_block_built_duration`.
    - **Component-Specific Monitoring:** Defining metrics for `flashblocks-websocket-proxy`, `flashblocks-RPC Node-Reth`, and `Op-Node-Rbuilder` to ensure end-to-end observability.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly focused, centered on the flashblocks monitoring discussion in issue [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16388). A dedicated call between team members yashvardhan-kukreja and Jacob was noted, indicating direct and detailed planning. The discussion also linked to an implementation pull request in the `k8s` repository ([#7162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/k8s/pull/7162)), highlighting cross-repository coordination where design decisions in this repo are directly informing infrastructure work elsewhere.
