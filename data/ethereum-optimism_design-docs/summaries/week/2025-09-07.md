# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing protocol security and operational stability. Significant progress was made with new design documents for Safe modules, including a LivenessModule and a TimelockGuard, alongside a low-level security improvement with Fused Multiply-Add. On the operational front, the team advanced flashblocks integration, resolved issues with `op-batcher` throttling and `op-geth` stability, and made strides in testing infrastructure with the `op-sync-tester`. A notable trend was the extensive cleanup of issues related to the Kurtosis devnet, signaling a strategic shift or completion of a major workstream.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Completed work this week focused on bolstering security through new design specifications and refining existing documentation.

- **Security Module Design:** New design documents were introduced to improve the security and robustness of managed safes. This includes a proposal for an updated `LivenessModule` ([#320](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/320)) and a new `TimelockGuard` for controlled access ([#324](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/324)). A lower-level security feature was also added to implement Fused Multiply-Add (FMA) for u16a ([#334](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/334)).

- **Documentation and Design Refinements:** The `dispute-game-creators` design document was reorganized to improve clarity and better articulate its purpose ([#331](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/331)). Additionally, new design proposals were opened for a Flash BAL system ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/337)) and a migration from Kurtosis to Sysgo ([#335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/335)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was characterized by a major cleanup of the Kurtosis backlog and a focus on resolving critical stability bugs.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Kurtosis Devnet Cleanup:** A large number of issues related to the Kurtosis devnet were closed, having been either completed, deprioritized, or marked as "will not be implemented." This includes work on genesis checks ([#15753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15753)), performance improvements ([#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/14390)), and `op-validator` support ([#16712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16712)).
    - **Operational Stability:** Key stability issues were resolved, including an improvement to the `op-batcher` throttling metric ([#17149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17149)), a fix for `op-geth` initialization with large genesis files ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/668)), and a resolution for an abnormal CPU usage bug in `op-geth` ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/613)).
    - **Flashblocks & Testing:** Progress was marked by the closure of issues related to mainnet flashblocks sequencer management ([#17318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17318), [#17319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17319)) and the completion of the first milestone for the `op-sync-tester` ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16703)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Critical `op-geth` Bug:** A significant issue ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/679)) was reported where `op-geth` crashes during a full sync on op-mainnet due to a failure to decode RLP receipts. The team has acknowledged the issue and a fix appears to be available in a recent patch.
    - **Future Work:** New issues were opened to conduct threat modeling for the DA Footprint Limit ([#336](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/336)) and to add an optimization hint for block header lookups in `op-program` ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17416)).
    - **Ongoing Discussions:** The effort to add a nightly CI job for the sync tester ([#17253](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17253)) is currently blocked by an infrastructure issue. Two new bug reports ([#338](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/338), [#339](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/339)) were opened but lack details.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The rapid response to the critical `op-geth` RLP decoding bug ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/679)) demonstrated effective collaboration between community reporters and the core development team, leading to a swift investigation and fix. The coordinated closure of numerous Kurtosis-related issues suggests a decisive internal effort to refine project priorities and clear the backlog. The continuous stream of new and refined design documents highlights the repository's central role in shaping the future of the Optimism protocol.
