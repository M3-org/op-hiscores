# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were heavily concentrated on the design and refinement of the OP Stack's economic mechanisms. Significant progress was made in advancing fee-related proposals, including the introduction of new designs for revenue sharing ([#309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/309)) and L1 congestion fees ([#312](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/312)). The `min-base-fee` feature moved closer to implementation with ongoing specification discussions, risk analysis planning, and the sharing of early implementation drafts. Additionally, a new design was requested to explore congestion-based transaction reordering, signaling a proactive approach to network performance and fee market stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This week saw one merged refinement to the protocol's fee structure and several new design proposals for future enhancements.

- **Protocol Fee Formula Refinement**
  A fix was merged to refine the `operatorFee` calculation by adjusting the operator fee scalar. This update provides a more precise formula for determining operator fees within the protocol ([#299](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/299)).

- **New Fee Mechanism Designs**
  Two significant design proposals were initiated via new pull requests:
  - A design for a **revenue sharing** mechanism was proposed ([#309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/309)).
  - An initial draft for an **L1 congestion fee** design document was added, aiming to address costs associated with L1 congestion ([#312](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/312)).

- **Custom Gas Token Migration**
  A new pull request was opened to introduce a design for **custom gas token migration** functionality, expanding the flexibility of gas payments on the network ([#313](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/313)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Documentation:** A long-standing issue regarding unclear L1 contract deployment steps in the L2 Testnet Tutorial ([#1401](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/1401)) was closed after the relevant documentation was updated.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **`min-base-fee` Advancement:** The `min-base-fee` feature saw significant activity. A new issue was opened to conduct a formal Failure Modes Analysis ([#311](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/311)) to assess potential risks. Discussions on the main tracking issue ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16807)) included links to in-flight implementation work in `reth` and `op-alloy`. A key discussion point on the specification issue ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/742)) led to a request for estimating the state growth impact of the feature.
  - **Congestion-Based Transaction Reordering:** A new issue ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/306)) was opened to request a design for reordering builder transactions based on congestion. The proposal suggests tracking excess Data Availability (DA) usage with an exponential penalty, a concept that could be tested off-protocol.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the discussions around new and complex features. The new issue for congestion-based transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/306)) immediately saw a contributor express interest in collaborating on the design. The ongoing work on `min-base-fee` highlights strong cross-repository coordination, with contributors sharing early drafts from `reth` ([https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/17704](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/17704)) to gather feedback, demonstrating a collaborative approach to moving design concepts toward implementation.
