# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant strides in core protocol design and a concerted effort to enhance system robustness. A major highlight was the introduction of a new, minimal design for Custom Gas Token (CGT) support, setting a future-proof foundation for this functionality. Alongside this, new proposals for a Reactive Security Council and a fee splitter signal ongoing work to strengthen the economic and security models of the OP Stack. Concurrently, active discussions focused on improving monitoring, alerting, and testing for critical components like Flashblocks, and exploring alternative P2P sync mechanisms to improve scalability and recovery.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Completed work this week focused on advancing protocol capabilities and improving developer tooling documentation.

-   **Custom Gas Token (CGT) Protocol Design:** A new, minimal, and flexible design for Custom Gas Token support was introduced ([#305]). This replaces previous experimental approaches with a more robust architecture intended to support a wider range of gas token functionalities across the OP Stack.
-   **Deployment Tooling Documentation:** To improve the developer experience, a new design document was added for the `op-deployer`, specifically detailing its use with Forge ([#325]).
-   **Liquidity Controller Enhancement:** The `LiquidityController` documentation was updated to include a new `deauthorizeMinter` function ([#329]). This provides chain operators with greater flexibility to manage, replace, or deprecate authorized minters.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved finalizing specifications, closing out lower-priority tooling tasks, and advancing discussions on critical infrastructure like Flashblocks and P2P syncing.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Specification Finalization:** The `min-base-fee` specification issue ([#742]) was closed, marking its finalization.
    -   **Tooling & Maintenance:** Several issues were closed after deciding not to proceed with the work, including adding challenger support to `op-up` ([#17005]) and cleaning up `op-up` logging ([#17007]). The tracking issue for an "Event Call Graph" in `op-service` ([#16874]) was also closed, as the team is considering removing the event system entirely.
    -   **Deprioritization:** The issue for "Consensus influencing event nonces" ([#13543]) was closed as its implementation is not planned for the near future.
    -   **Investigation & Postmortems:** The postmortem for a "Scalar fix" ([#17012]) was completed, and an issue regarding missing test logs ([#17151]) was closed after the logs were located.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **New Proposals:** Several new pull requests were opened, initiating design discussions for a [Reactive Security Council](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/327), a [fee splitter](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/328), and clarifications to the [dispute game creator](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/331) design.
    -   **Flashblocks Hardening:** A significant portion of active discussion centered on Flashblocks. This includes improving monitoring and alerting ([#16388]), creating alerts for low peer counts ([#16868]) and sequencer status changes ([#16867]), planning load tests ([#16756]), and enabling tests on persistent devnets ([#17248]).
    -   **P2P Sync Architecture:** A detailed discussion continued on deprecating the req-resp P2P sync ([#14108]). A new proposal was introduced for an alternative unsafe block sync mechanism using Redis for block gossip, which aims to be simpler, faster, and complementary to existing methods.
    -   **Testing & CI:** The sync test issue ([#16703]) was reopened to expand test coverage to all Hard Fork transitions. Separately, a proposal was made to improve monorepo CI for `op-geth` PRs by adding a periodic job to check for integration issues ([#665]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed architectural discussions this week. The conversation around deprecating the req-resp P2P sync ([#14108]) highlighted knowledge sharing, with ideas from one team member being extensively detailed by another. Similarly, discussions around Flashblocks monitoring and alerting ([#16388], [#16868]) showed a focused group effort to improve system reliability. The resolution of an `op-proposer` issue ([#13502]) through user confirmation of a configuration fix demonstrates effective feedback loops with the broader community.
