# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on significant cleanup and refinement across the project's core infrastructure. A substantial number of long-standing issues related to the Superchain Registry, CI/CD stability, and deployment processes were closed, indicating a strong push to reduce technical debt and improve system reliability. This focus on strengthening existing foundations was complemented by forward-looking work, with the initiation of a new design document for L2 Contract Management. The overall theme was one of stabilization and preparation for future development.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
While no direct code changes were merged, progress was made on the protocol design front.

*   **L2 Contract Management Design**
    A new design proposal was opened in PR [#351](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/351) to outline a system for L2 Contract Management. This document marks the beginning of formalizing processes related to contracts on Layer 2, a key aspect of OP Stack development and developer experience.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The week was characterized by a major effort in issue resolution and backlog grooming.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    A large volume of issues were closed, resolving problems across several key areas:
    *   **Superchain Registry:** A major push concluded with the closure of eight issues ([#284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/284), [#294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/294), [#609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/609), [#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/675), and others) related to registry refactoring, diff tooling, and configuration for chains like Holesky.
    *   **Testing and CI:** Stability was improved by resolving issues with flaky acceptance tests, making tests blocking, and enhancing reporting ([#16270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16270), [#477](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/477], [#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/635]).
    *   **Deployment & Configuration:** Processes were streamlined by closing issues related to `op-deployer` verification, `addresses.json` generation, and chain addition scripts ([#17145](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17145), [#999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/999]).
    *   **Fault Proofs:** A key issue ([#604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/604)) was closed, marking progress on overhauling how fault proof contract addresses are managed in chain configurations.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    No new issues were opened this week. Activity on existing issues focused on re-evaluation and investigation:
    *   Several older issues related to acceptance tests ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16273), [#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17525), [#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/643)) are being reviewed to determine if they are still relevant after recent refactors.
    *   The `proxyd` "time travel" bug ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/501)) remains an active area of investigation, with more context being linked from related issues.
    *   Discussion continues on an alert for non-flashblocks-enabled sequencers ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16867)) to determine its current relevance.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was heavily focused on issue triage and backlog maintenance. Contributor `janjakubnanista` was notably active, driving discussions on multiple older issues to assess their current priority and relevance, often pinging other contributors like `bitwiseguy` for input. This proactive grooming effort demonstrates healthy project stewardship. Additionally, discussions between `zhwrd` and `jelias2` on alerting, and `alfonso-op` linking related issues, highlight the team's collaborative approach to problem-solving and knowledge sharing.
