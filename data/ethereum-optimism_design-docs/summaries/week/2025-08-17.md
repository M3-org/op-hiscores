# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant progress in finalizing major initiatives and enhancing system robustness. Key achievements include the successful rollout of Flashblocks on all Sunnyside sequencers and the completion of interop acceptance testing for the proofs system, marking the end of a substantial effort. The team also concluded a cleanup of the event system by removing obsolete events. Concurrently, a new design for a "Single-Approval Long-Delay TimelockGuard" was proposed, indicating a continued focus on security and governance innovation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no new features were merged directly into the `design-docs` repository, activity this week centered on tracking and concluding several critical technical initiatives across the Optimism ecosystem.

The most significant development was the confirmation that Flashblocks are now fully enabled on all Sunnyside sequencers for Sepolia, as tracked in issue [#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16688). This milestone enhances the sequencing process and concludes a key infrastructure upgrade.

Additionally, a new pull request ([#326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/326)) was opened, introducing a design for a "Single-Approval Long-Delay TimelockGuard," representing new work on the project's governance and security mechanisms.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a strong focus on closing out long-standing issues, reflecting a period of stabilization and refinement.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Proofs System & Testing Finalization:** Work on the proofs system was finalized with the closure of issues [#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15946) and [#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15948), which tracked the completion of `op-challenger` acceptance tests for interop chains.
    - **Event System Cleanup:** Issue [#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17001) was closed after two events were successfully removed from the event system, streamlining the codebase.
    - **Testing Framework Refinement:** An issue regarding test target setup ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/375)) was closed, noting that `sysgo` has superseded Kurtosis for network testing needs.
    - **Sequencer Feature Rollout:** The successful enablement of Flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers was confirmed with the closure of [#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16688).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Contract Verification:** An important ongoing discussion in [#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/14813) centers on improving contract verification. The latest proposal is to leverage `forge verify-contract` to streamline verification on both Etherscan and Blockscout, reducing the need for custom code.
    - **RPC Responses:** Discussion continued in [#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/389) about missing content types in RPC responses, with a community member asking for guidance on how to contribute a fix.
    - **Test Logging:** Work is in progress to resolve missing test logs in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17151)) by moving tests to a workflow that properly captures logs.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the tracking and resolution of the event system cleanup ([#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17001)). Contributor `joshklop` provided consistent updates, linking to pull requests in the main `optimism` repository, which demonstrates effective cross-repository coordination to resolve a design-level issue. Furthermore, community engagement was highlighted in issue [#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/389), where user `OBlackmon3` expressed interest in contributing a fix, signaling healthy external developer interest.
