# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on design discussions and strategic planning aimed at enhancing the robustness and efficiency of core OP Stack components. While the only concrete update was a revision to the custom gas token design document, significant conversations took place regarding transaction management, node reliability, and data availability. Key discussions focused on improving blob priority fee handling in the `op-batcher` to better manage network congestion and exploring solutions for `proxyd` synchronization issues. Additionally, a testing-related issue was closed, reflecting an evolution in the project's testing strategy.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Activity this week focused on refining existing design documentation rather than introducing new features.

- **Documentation Enhancements:** The design document for custom gas tokens was updated to align with the latest specifications, ensuring documentation reflects the current state of the design ([#352](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/352)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened this week. Triage and discussion focused on resolving existing design challenges and refining testing processes.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Testing Strategy Refinement:** An issue regarding the reporting of unused acceptance tests ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16273)) was closed. This decision reflects a strategic shift, as the team's primary use of "gateless mode" for testing has made the previous requirement obsolete.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`op-batcher` Fee Management (`#18102`):** A significant discussion continued around improving how the `op-batcher/txmgr` handles blob priority fees. A "quick win" was proposed where the starting fee for a new transaction would "decay" from the previous one, helping to clear backlogs more effectively. This is being weighed against a more comprehensive but larger effort to build a dedicated blob priority fee tracker.
    - **`proxyd` Reliability (`#501`):** A critical discussion highlighted how `proxyd` can experience "backwards time travel" when its backends are out of sync, affecting RPC calls like `eth_call`. Potential solutions were brainstormed, including a "multicall" strategy, silent fallbacks to other backends, and session stickiness, each with different trade-offs.
    - **DA Footprint Limit Documentation (`#1742`):** Discussions continued on the need to document the DA Footprint Limit, with an emphasis on clarifying the risks associated with its configuration and its interaction with the Gas Limit.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was concentrated within GitHub issues, indicating a strong focus on design and problem-solving before implementation. The detailed discussions in issues like `#18102` (blob priority fees) and `#501` (`proxyd` synchronization) demonstrate a collaborative effort to weigh the trade-offs between short-term fixes and more robust, long-term architectural solutions. The activity suggests a healthy process of peer review and brainstorming on foundational design elements that are critical to the security and efficiency of the OP Stack.
