# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Sep 21 - 27, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts focused on enhancing the core protocol's robustness and security. A significant design update introduced a Data Availability (DA) footprint block limit, a mechanism aimed at mitigating spam and preventing priority fee auctions by dynamically managing block capacity. Additionally, progress was made on the sequencer infrastructure, with the successful enablement of flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on a key protocol enhancement documented for the OP Stack.

### Protocol Enhancements for Spam Mitigation
To improve network stability, a design for a DA footprint block limit was introduced ([#317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/317)). This mechanism tracks the DA footprint of transactions alongside gas usage, allowing the protocol to dynamically adjust the block gas limit based on the estimated impact on data availability. This change is designed to make the protocol more resilient to data spam.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of a key infrastructure task, with no new issues being opened.

- **Closed Issues:** The effort to enable flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers was completed, resolving issue [#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16761). The update confirms that flashblocks are now successfully enabled.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported during this period.
