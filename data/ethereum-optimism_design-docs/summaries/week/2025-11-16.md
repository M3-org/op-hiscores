# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing protocol robustness and addressing technical debt. Significant progress was made on improving the recovery path for hardfork activations, a critical component for network security. Concurrently, a systematic review of past refactors led to the re-opening of several issues in `op-node` and `op-supervisor` to ensure all `TODO`s are resolved. Key decisions were made regarding feature evaluation, with the team opting to monitor the `min-base-fee` feature in production rather than through further simulation.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on strengthening the protocol's upgrade and recovery mechanisms.

- **Hardfork Activation Recovery:** A new pull request ([#357](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/357)) was opened and actively developed to update and add alternative recovery methods for hardfork activation. This initiative aims to improve the resilience and security of the protocol during critical network upgrades.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was characterized by the resolution of Superchain registry tasks and a concerted effort to clean up lingering technical debt.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Superchain Registry (SCR) 2.0:** Several issues related to the SCR refactor were closed, marking progress in chain management tooling. This included allowing chains to opt into hardforks via the `add-chain` tool ([#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/610)) and improving CI job summaries ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/644)).
    - **Min-Base-Fee Feature:** A decision was made to close the issue on `min-base-fee` simulations ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16958)), with the plan to observe the feature's performance directly in a production environment.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Technical Debt Cleanup:** A significant number of issues for `op-node` and `op-supervisor` were re-opened by `ajsutton` due to remaining `TODO`s in the codebase. This indicates a focused effort to complete cleanup from previous refactors, including the event system ([#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16917)), Interop activation logic ([#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16141)), and the removal of multi-node support in the supervisor ([#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16174)).
    - **Blocked `op-node` Work:** Several issues concerning EL Sync correctness and safe head advancement ([#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17631), [#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18124), [#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18125)) are currently blocked and will be addressed after request/response sync is fully deprecated.
    - **Pending Designs & Docs:** The `fusaka-on-l2` design finalization ([#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/355)) is awaiting customer feedback. Active discussion is also underway to ensure the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades is clearly communicated in the documentation ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18095)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the strategic alignment and triage activities this week. Contributors `ajsutton` and `mslipper` played key roles in driving progress. `ajsutton` led a thorough review of existing code, re-opening several issues to ensure completeness and address technical debt. `mslipper` provided crucial direction on multiple issues, clarifying dependencies and defining the path forward for feature designs and bug fixes. Additionally, discussion on issue [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18095) highlighted coordination with the documentation team to ensure clear communication for upcoming upgrades.
