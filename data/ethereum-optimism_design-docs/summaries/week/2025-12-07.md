# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on architectural refinement and investigating a critical node synchronization issue. While no new features were merged, a significant new issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18581)) emerged, reporting synchronization failures affecting nodes across the Superchain ecosystem and prompting an active diagnostic effort. Concurrently, progress was made on architectural design with a new proposal to simplify the Kona node actor ([#358](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/358)). Community engagement was also notable, with a contributor stepping up to address a needed health check for `op-rbuilder`.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on foundational design improvements rather than new features or bug fixes.

A new pull request, [#358](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/358), was opened to simplify the Kona node actor design. This indicates ongoing efforts to refine the core architecture of the system.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The week was defined by the emergence of a high-priority issue, while no issues were closed.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Node Synchronization Failures:** A critical new issue, [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18581), was opened concerning node synchronization problems. Users reported that nodes were failing to sync, leading to L2 block creation failures with errors like "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload." The problem appears to affect users across Base, Optimism, and Unichain, with initial reports pointing to potential issues with snapshots from publicnode.com. Maintainers are actively investigating and have requested detailed client configurations and logs to diagnose the root cause.
    - **`op-rbuilder` Health Check:** Issue [#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17685), which proposes a dedicated replica-healthcheck for `op-rbuilder`, saw renewed activity. A community member expressed interest in taking on the task, signaling potential progress on ensuring the reliability of the builder.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the response to the week's challenges and ongoing tasks.

- The node synchronization issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18581)) sparked significant discussion, with users from multiple chains collaborating by sharing similar error reports, which is crucial for diagnosing a widespread problem.
- Community contribution was highlighted in issue [#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17685), where user "Himess" volunteered to implement the needed health check, demonstrating proactive engagement from the community.
