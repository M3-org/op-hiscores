# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity was centered on system stability and architectural refinement. A significant new issue emerged concerning node synchronization failures, affecting users across multiple chains and prompting an active investigation by maintainers. In parallel, development continued with a new proposal to simplify the Kona node actor design. Community engagement was also notable, with a contributor stepping up to tackle a health check implementation for `op-rbuilder`, highlighting a collaborative effort to improve the ecosystem's reliability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
While no major features were merged, foundational work was initiated to improve the system's architecture.

*   **Architectural Refinement**
    *   A new pull request, [#358](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/358), was opened with the goal of simplifying the Kona node actor design. This indicates an ongoing effort to refine and streamline core components of the stack.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The focus this week was heavily on diagnosing a critical new issue, while progress was also noted on an existing reliability task.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   No issues were closed during this period.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Node Synchronization Failures:** A critical issue, [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18581), was reported where nodes are failing to synchronize. Users on Base, Optimism, and Unichain are encountering "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors, suggesting the L1 Execution Client is not providing necessary state data to the Op-Node. The issue appears to be prevalent for users of Publicnode snapshots with specific client versions (`op-geth v1.101603.5 jovian`, `op-node v1.16.3`). Maintainers are actively investigating and have requested detailed logs and configurations to diagnose the root cause.
    *   **Replica Healthcheck for op-rbuilder:** Discussion continued on issue [#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17685), which proposes a dedicated health check to prevent `op-rbuilder` from diverging from `op-geth`. A community member expressed interest in taking on this task, signaling potential progress on this reliability improvement.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted active collaboration between the core team and the community on critical operational issues and feature development.

*   The node synchronization issue [#18581] saw immediate engagement, with multiple users providing detailed reports and maintainers responding quickly to coordinate a diagnostic effort.
*   In issue [#17685], a community member proactively volunteered to implement the `op-rbuilder` health check, demonstrating a healthy and engaged contributor ecosystem willing to tackle important reliability tasks.
