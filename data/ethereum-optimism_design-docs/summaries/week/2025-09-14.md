# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on solidifying the protocol's design and operational procedures. Significant progress was made in closing out long-standing research and analysis tasks, including the completion of threat modeling for the Data Availability Footprint Limit and evaluations of flashblocks load testing. A critical receipt decoding bug was effectively addressed, and a new initiative was launched to establish a robust convention for network upgrade transactions, aiming to improve the predictability and safety of future contract deployments. The focus was clearly on analysis, bug resolution, and forward-looking architectural planning rather than new feature implementation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring pull requests were merged this week according to the provided reports. The development focus was on discussion, analysis, and resolving issues at the design stage.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of several key issues and the start of an important discussion on future network upgrade procedures.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Analysis & Evaluation:** Several major analysis tasks were concluded. This includes the threat modeling for the DA Footprint Limit ([#336](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/336)), the summary of flashblocks load testing on devnets ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16756)), and the evaluation of partner support criteria on eris-0 ([#16765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16765)).
    - **Code Structure:** An issue to consolidate duplicated address structs into a single source of truth was closed, completing its intended scope ([#14977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/14977)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Network Upgrade Convention:** A significant new issue was opened to define a formal convention for network upgrade transactions that deploy new contracts ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/781)). The current ad-hoc method affects deployment addresses, and discussion has already begun on using `CREATE2` with a system address and source-hash for improved collision resistance and predictability.
    - **Bug Resolution:** A fix was proposed for a critical RLP receipt decoding failure in Geth v1.101602.0 ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/679)). The reporter confirmed the patch appears to resolve the issue, moving it closer to closure.
    - **Dispute Game Design:** Discussion continued on the spec updates for the dispute game creator pattern refactor ([#17436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17436)), with efforts to clarify the issue's scope and objectives.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was centered on issue discussion and design refinement. The active back-and-forth on the new network upgrade transaction convention ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/781)) highlights a proactive approach to establishing robust protocol standards. Similarly, the quick feedback loop on the receipt decoding bug ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/679)), where a proposed fix was tested and confirmed by the original reporter, demonstrates effective problem-solving within the community. The activity reflects a healthy focus on improving the core design and stability of the protocol through collaborative specification.
