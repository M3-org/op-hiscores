# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by maintenance and issue backlog grooming rather than new development. The primary focus was on closing out long-standing issues related to the stability and operation of core infrastructure, including the sequencer and nodes. This effort helps to clean up the issue tracker and formally resolve problems that have since been addressed or are no longer relevant. A key policy was also clarified: the project's NPM packages, such as `@eth-optimism/contracts-bedrock`, are no longer being updated.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features, bug fixes, or refactoring efforts were merged this week. The development focus was on administrative cleanup, with the closure of issue [#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/413) confirming that the `TestChainFork` acceptance test had been successfully ported to `devstack` in a previous pull request.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week's activity centered entirely on issue management, with a significant number of older issues being closed. No new issues were opened.

- **Closed Issues:** Several key issues were resolved and closed, improving the clarity of the project's current state.
    - **Sequencer Stability:** Issues concerning sequencer recovery from a sequence window expiration ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/11228)) and halting on temporary L1 errors ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/12240)) were closed, as they were either resolved by prior work or are no longer considered active problems.
    - **Node Operation & Dependencies:** An issue regarding the inability to start a new node ([#15411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15411)) was closed as resolved. A request to update the `@eth-optimism/contracts-bedrock` NPM package ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/13459)) was closed with the clarification that these packages are no longer maintained.
    - **Testing:** An issue tracking the port of a test to `devstack` ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/413)) was closed, marking the task as complete.

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, indicating a period of stability or a focus on consolidating existing work before identifying new tasks.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's activity highlights a focused effort by project maintainers to manage the issue backlog. The closure of multiple stale or resolved issues by a single contributor suggests a deliberate cleanup initiative to improve the health and accuracy of the project's issue tracker. There was no significant public discussion or collaboration on new features noted in the reports.
