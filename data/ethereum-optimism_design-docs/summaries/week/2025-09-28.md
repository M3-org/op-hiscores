# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Sep 28 - Oct 4, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by the conclusion of several major initiatives and the clarification of key technical behaviors. The Isthmus Upgrade was officially marked as complete, a significant milestone for the project. Work on flashblocks infrastructure was also finalized with the successful deployment of an RPC node and the completion of load testing. Discussions around L2 Execution Layer synchronization led to a clearer understanding of the protocol, resolving an active investigation. Meanwhile, new challenges have emerged, including a critical compatibility issue with Go 1.25 affecting the Cannon fault-proof system and a strategic pivot in how `op-reth` will be integrated for testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no new features were merged via pull requests this week, progress was marked by the closure of several issues representing the completion of significant workstreams.

- **Isthmus Upgrade Concluded:** The primary tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/12703)) was closed, formally signaling the successful completion of this major network upgrade.
- **Flashblocks Infrastructure Finalized:** Work on the flashblocks RPC service was completed. This included the deployment of a new node, `op-opn-reth-f-fb-0` ([#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16764)), and the documentation of load test results for the `rollup-boost flashblocks forwarder` ([#17462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17462)).
- **Acceptance Test Tooling Enhanced:** To improve diagnostics, the `op-acceptor` tool was updated to include setup information in its HTML output, with the work completed in a related infrastructure PR ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/386)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week's issue management focused on closing out resolved topics and identifying new challenges related to tooling and documentation.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - The investigation into the conditions required for the L2 Execution Layer to begin syncing was closed ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17628)). The discussion concluded that existing mechanisms, such as `engineController.insertUnsafePayload`, sufficiently handle the process, clarifying a key aspect of node synchronization.
  - As mentioned above, the closure of issues for the Isthmus Upgrade ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/12703)), flashblocks deployment ([#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17464)), load testing ([#17462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17462)), and `op-acceptor` output ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/386)) marked the end of these work items.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Terminology Standardization:** A new issue ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/342)) was opened to address inconsistent use of "soft-fork" and "hard-fork" terminology within the documentation, aiming for greater precision.
  - **Cannon/Go 1.25 Blocker:** A significant active issue ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17060)) highlights that Cannon produces incorrect Keccak hashes when compiled with Go 1.25, impacting block hash calculations. This is a blocker for Go 1.25 adoption and is dependent on an upstream fix in the Go repository.
  - **`op-reth` Integration Strategy:** Discussion on issue [#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17475) revealed a strategic shift. Instead of adding `op-reth` back to the deprecated Jovian Kurtosis devnet, the focus is now on integrating it into the `devstack / sysgo` system.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the detailed technical discussions aimed at resolving complex issues and aligning on future strategy.
- The resolution of the L2EL syncing issue ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17628)) showcased effective collaboration between contributors `@pcw109550`, `@sebastianst`, and `@ajsutton`, who worked together to refine their understanding of client sync behavior.
- Similarly, `@pauldowman` and `@ajsutton` collaborated on diagnosing the critical Cannon compatibility issue with Go 1.25 ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17060)).
- Strategic direction was provided by `@geoknee` on the `op-reth` integration issue ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17475)), guiding the effort towards more modern and maintained tooling. This reflects a healthy process of technical debate and strategic alignment among core team members.
