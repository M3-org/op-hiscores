# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Aug 10 - 16, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on maturing the design documentation for the `min-base-fee` feature, with significant effort dedicated to formalizing its threat model and analyzing its state growth impact. The work culminated in the migration of the threat model into the repository and the resolution of related analysis tasks. Alongside this refinement, the team explored several forward-looking protocol enhancements, opening new design proposals for a v2 liveness module, nonceless execution, and a `TimelockGuard`. The reopening of several older issues related to testing infrastructure also indicates a renewed focus on completing outstanding tasks and bolstering test coverage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on solidifying existing feature designs while proposing new architectural concepts.

-   **Min-Base-Fee Design Finalization:** A major focus was placed on completing the design documentation for the `min-base-fee` feature. A comprehensive threat model was formally added to the repository, migrating it from an external Notion document ([#314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/314)). Further refinements included adding and then downgrading the assessment of database growth impact ([#319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/319), [#321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/321)), and adding an addendum on the use of feature toggles ([#323](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/323)).

-   **New Protocol Feature Proposals:** Several new design documents were proposed, signaling active research and development into future protocol upgrades:
    -   **Liveness Module v2:** A proposal for a new version of the liveness module was introduced ([#320](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/320)).
    -   **Nonceless Execution:** A design discussion was initiated around the concept of nonceless execution ([#322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/322)).
    -   **TimelockGuard:** A new `TimelockGuard` feature was proposed, suggesting enhancements to time-based security mechanisms ([#324](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/324)).
    -   **Data Availability Limits:** A proposal was opened concerning data availability footprint block limits for the "Jovian" upgrade ([#317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/317)).

-   **Protocol Design Process Improvements:** To improve documentation consistency, guidance on naming conventions for activation checks within decoupled features was added to the protocol design documents ([#318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/318)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved closing out analysis tasks for `min-base-fee`, opening new tracking issues for maintenance, and revisiting previously deprioritized work.

-   **Closed Issues:** Key issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature were closed, marking the completion of the failure modes analysis ([#311](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/311)) and the state growth estimation ([#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/316)). An older issue for a design document on congestion-based builder transaction reordering was also closed ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/306)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **New Maintenance Task:** A new issue was created to track the migration of fault proof recovery tasks to a new template framework ([#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/1162)).
    -   **Reopened Testing Issues:** Several issues related to testing were reopened to address pending `TODOs` in the codebase. This includes adding acceptance tests for `op-challenger` ([#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15948)), enabling `op-sync-tester` to serve the `eth` namespace ([#16700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16700)), and integrating `op-test-sequencer` for reorg tests ([#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15265)).
    -   **Ongoing Discussions:** Community members continued to seek solutions for `op-proposer` transaction failures in issue [#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/13502). A discussion on tracing event call graphs ([#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16874)) revealed a potential strategic shift towards removing the event system entirely, illustrating how design discussions can influence architectural direction.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both community troubleshooting and internal strategic alignment. The `op-proposer` failure issue ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/13502)) continues to serve as a point of engagement for users experiencing similar problems. Internally, the reopening of several issues by team members to address lingering `TODOs` demonstrates a commitment to code quality and completeness. The discussion around event call graph tracing ([#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16874)) highlighted transparent communication, where a team member explained that a proposed contribution might not be merged due to a larger, pending architectural change, providing valuable context to the contributor.
