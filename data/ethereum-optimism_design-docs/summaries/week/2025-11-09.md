# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on foundational design work for future protocol capabilities and enhancing the robustness of the current system. A significant first draft for a ZK Proofs design document was introduced, signaling a major area of future exploration. Concurrently, a new design for deterministic L2 contract management was proposed to streamline the upgrade process. Ongoing discussions focused on optimizing core components like `op-node`'s safe-head advancement and batcher safeguards, while key testing and integration milestones were achieved for the Kona fault-proof client.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
This week saw the introduction of two significant design proposals aimed at shaping the future of the OP Stack.

- **ZK Proofs Design:** A first draft of the ZK Proofs design document was opened for review ([#356](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/356)), initiating the formal process of exploring and defining the integration of zero-knowledge technology within the ecosystem.
- **L2 Contract Management Strategy:** A new design was added to outline a deterministic, hard fork-driven upgrade process for L2 contracts ([#351](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/351)). This strategy aims to improve the upgrade experience for protocol developers by defining both implementation and upgrade paths directly in Solidity.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Work this week involved resolving key testing issues and continuing discussions on protocol optimization and tooling upgrades.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Kona Testing & Integration:** Significant progress was made on the Kona fault-proof client. An issue was closed confirming that Jovian action tests are now successfully integrated into Kona's CI ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17303)). A related tracking issue for adding support for embedded custom prestates to Kona was also closed ([#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18271)).
    - **Development Environment:** An issue related to `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` was closed, with a note indicating that the Kurtosis testing tool is being deprecated ([#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16704)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this week.
    - **Protocol Optimization:** Discussions continued on improving core protocol stability. This includes optimizing `op-node`'s safe-head advancement by potentially aggregating FCU messages ([#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15393)) and enhancing safeguards for batcher updates on the SystemConfig ([#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18246)).
    - **Tooling & Documentation:** An active discussion is focused on updating the `print_staging_report` script for compatibility with dispute-game v2, considering how to handle game arguments and the future existence of multiple permissionless games ([#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/1148)). Separately, work is underway to ensure the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement is clearly documented for upcoming upgrades ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18095)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was heavily focused on long-term architectural planning and the technical refinement of existing systems. The introduction of major design documents for ZK Proofs and L2 contract upgrades indicates a strategic, forward-looking effort by core contributors. The detailed discussions in active issues, particularly around dispute-game v2 compatibility and safe-head advancement, highlight the ongoing, in-depth collaboration required to maintain and evolve the core protocol.
