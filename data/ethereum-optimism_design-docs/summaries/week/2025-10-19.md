# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on enhancing protocol security and advancing preparations for the upcoming Fusaka network upgrade. A critical security fix was implemented to address an issue with operator fees. Meanwhile, discussions confirmed that key preparatory tasks for Fusaka, including the `op-geth` merge and absolute prestate updates, have been successfully completed on the Sepolia testnet, with attention now turning towards tracking the Mainnet rollout. The team also addressed a developer tooling issue related to `mise` installation.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on a targeted security improvement within the protocol.

*   **Protocol Security**
    *   A fix was merged to resolve a Fault Message Authentication (FMA) issue related to operator fees, strengthening the security of the system ([#349](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/349)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed this week, but significant progress was made in ongoing discussions.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   No issues were closed during this reporting period.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Fusaka Upgrade Preparations:** Discussions on active issues confirmed progress for the Fusaka upgrade. The Superchain-ops task for the absolute prestate update ([#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/1206)) and the `op-geth` upstream merge ([#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/682)) are both complete for Sepolia. The conversation is now focused on whether to keep these issues open to track the corresponding tasks for Mainnet.
    *   **Developer Tooling:** An installation error with `mise` was investigated in [#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17963). The issue was traced to URL formatting in the current `mise` version. A workaround was identified: using the install script from the `develop` branch of the Optimism repository, which provides a compatible version.
