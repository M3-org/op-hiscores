# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on strengthening the protocol and planning for future upgrades. A key design document was merged for a critical fix related to the OPCM Superchain upgrade, enhancing protocol security. Concurrently, significant discussion took place around the upcoming Kona + Cannon upgrade, with teams coordinating on necessary changes to contracts, dispute monitoring, and prestate integration. New proposals were also introduced, including an update to the minimum base fee calculation to account for database growth.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on both immediate protocol fixes and laying the groundwork for future enhancements.

*   **Protocol Security & Superchain Upgrades:** A design document for a critical fix related to the OPCM Superchain upgrade was completed and merged ([#310](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/310)). This work addresses a protocol issue and ensures alignment with the broader Superchain interoperability goals.

*   **New Proposals & Documentation:** Two new pull requests were opened to propose changes and update documentation:
    *   A proposal was made to update the minimum base fee calculation to better manage database growth ([#333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/333)).
    *   A minor update to the repository's README was also proposed ([#332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/332)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed this week, but there was substantial discussion on several active issues, indicating a focus on planning and resolving existing technical challenges.

*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Kona + Cannon Upgrade Planning:** A significant portion of discussion was dedicated to the upcoming Kona + Cannon upgrade. Key topics included:
        *   **OPCM Support ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17285)):** Confirmed that `OPContractsManager.sol` will require updates to support deploying the new game type.
        *   **Dispute Monitor ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17286)):** `op-dispute-mon` will need to be updated to explicitly support and correctly handle the new `cannon-kona` game type.
        *   **Prestate Integration ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17283)):** Discussion centered on how to integrate the new prestates, with a suggestion to use `type = "cannon-kona"` in `standard-prestates.toml`.
    *   **Developer Experience:** Improving the CI/CD pipeline and local testing is an ongoing effort ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17184)). Conversations explored identifying high-value CI jobs for local execution and automating config validation to reduce friction for developers.
    *   **Protocol Bugs & Tooling:**
        *   A bug in the P2P gossip configuration was identified where sane defaults are being overwritten with zero values, causing panics in tests ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17308)).
        *   The sync tester issue ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16703)) was reopened to ensure all Hardfork transitions are properly tested.
        *   It was noted that the Go 1.25.1 release does not include the MIPS fix required for Cannon ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17060)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions across multiple active issues. Team members like `ajsutton`, `pauldowman`, and `pcw109550` were actively engaged in planning the implementation details for the Kona + Cannon upgrade, ensuring different components like OPCM and `op-dispute-mon` are aligned. The ongoing dialogue around improving CI/CD configuration ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17184)) and resolving the P2P gossip bug ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17308)) highlights a collaborative effort to enhance the project's tooling and robustness.
