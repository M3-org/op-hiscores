# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Aug 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in protocol design with the introduction of Custom Gas Token support and documentation enhancements for the LiquidityController.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Custom Gas Token (CGT) Protocol Design
A new design for Custom Gas Token (CGT) support on OP Stack was introduced, replacing previous experimental approaches with a minimal, flexible, and future-proof architecture. This aims to support a broader range of gas token functionalities. ([#305](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/305))

### Liquidity Controller Documentation Update
Documentation for the `LiquidityController` was enhanced by adding details for a new `deauthorizeMinter` function. This function enables chain operators to remove, replace, or deprecate previously authorized minters, improving operational flexibility. ([#329](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/329))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
None.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Challenger Support in op-up
The issue concerning the support of the challenger in `op-up` was closed, with the conclusion that distributing the challenger within `op-up` for `sysgo` use is likely not worth the effort. The focus will shift towards other backends like Docker that do not require binary distribution. ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17005))

## NEW ISSUES
None.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-proposer Failed to Create Transaction ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/13502))
The discussion on this issue, which concerns the `op-proposer` failing to create transactions, saw a key resolution. A user confirmed that setting `--game-type=1` fixed the problem, aligning with previous suggestions to check and correctly configure the game type, especially for `PermissionedFaultDisputeGame`.

### Sync Test Using the Sync-Tester ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16703))
The issue was reopened to address the need for testing every Hard Fork (HF) transition, not just Isthmus. New test case ideas were proposed, including checking all OP Stack HF transitions with real data, validating multiple CLs syncing together with individual mock EL endpoints, and testing user transactions within L2 blocks to ensure L2CLs are synced. Items 2 and 3 are being tracked in a separate issue.

### Load Testing Flashblocks on Devnets ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16756))
The issue, which aims to perform load tests on `eris-0` to ensure public readiness, was briefly marked as done by accident but is still active. The team is currently working on a report summarizing the outcomes, including load test scenarios, networks used, and results.

### Alert When Non-Flashblocks-Enabled Sequencer is Active or Flashblocks are Turned Off ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16867))
This issue focuses on creating an alert for situations where a non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer becomes active or flashblocks are disabled, indicating a potential issue. A pull request related to `rollup-boost` is in progress, and an alert will be created once it lands.

### Alert on Low Peer Count Health of Flashblocks-Enabled Sequencer ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16868))
The discussion highlighted the criticality of healthy peers for flashblocks-enabled sequencers. It was noted that peer count alerting for `op-node` sequencer peering already exists for counts less than 2. The plan is to extend this by adding `reth`/`op-rbuilder` peer count alerts for this specific scenario.
