## ACTIVE ISSUES
*   **CI/CD and Developer Experience Improvements**
    *   [#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17184) "Improve UX and testability of CircleCI config": Discussions continued on improving the monorepo's CircleCI configuration. Key points included identifying high-value CI jobs for local execution (e.g., `kurtosis` and `go-tests-short`), addressing friction from manual prerequisite setup, and the potential for automating CircleCI config validation. There was also an interesting idea about dynamically sorting Go tests by run time to optimize local testing.
*   **Cannon and Kona Integration**
    *   [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17285) "Kona + Cannon: OPCM support": Discussion confirmed that the `OPContractsManager.sol` will need updates to support deploying the new game type for Kona + Cannon.
    *   [#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17283) "Kona + Cannon: standard prestates integration": The discussion focused on how to integrate Cannon + Kona prestates into `standard-prestates.toml`, with a suggestion to use `type = "cannon-kona"` for clarity.
*   **P2P Gossip Configuration Bug**
    *   [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17308) "op-node/p2p/gossip - ConfigureGossip overwrites sane defaults with zero values": This issue describes a bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane default values with zero values from the CLI configuration, leading to panics in some tests. The latest comments discuss whether a `DefaultP2PConfig` method should be introduced to provide valid defaults, or if the current approach of assuming zero values are invalid should be maintained.
*   **Sync Tester Enhancements**
    *   [#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16703) "op-sync-tester,op-acceptance-tests: sync test using the sync-tester": The issue was reopened as not all Hardfork transitions were tested. The latest comment from `pcw109550` confirms the reopening due to incomplete testing of each Hardfork transition.
*   **Go 1.25 Compatibility**
    *   [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17060) "cannon: Support go1.25": The release of Go 1.25.1 was noted, but it was also pointed out that this release does not appear to include the MIPS fix.
*   **Min-Base-Fee Updates**
    *   [#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/650) "min-base-fee: add an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3`": A comment linked to the updated specs for the Jovian overview.
