### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerting Improvements
Discussion on [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16388) continued with detailed notes from a call between yashvardhan-kukreja and Jacob. Key points include:
- **Peer Count:** Minimum of 4 peers.
- **Block Progression:** SLAs around block progression and divergence.
- **Pending Transactions:** Alerts if pending transactions exceed approximately 60 or spike, with verbose runbook instructions.
- **Flashblocks SLA:** A flashblocks-related SLA-like metric (p99 over a specified time interval) using `reth_op_rbuilder_total_block_built_duration`.
- **Flashblocks-websocket-proxy:** Monitoring for connection failures, errors, and the absence of metrics.
- **Flashblocks-RPC Node-Reth:** Metrics related to failing to listen to the flashblocks-websocket-proxy, including upstream errors (count below a number) and upstream messages (rate below a number).
- **Op-Node-Rbuilder:** Inheriting most op-node alerts and metrics.
