# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Aug 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the `min-base-fee` documentation, specifically addressing database growth estimates. Two new pull requests were opened, and one issue related to the `min-base-fee` was closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Refinement of Minimum Base Fee Documentation
Documentation for the `min-base-fee` feature underwent updates to include and then refine estimates for database growth. Initial estimates were added, and subsequently, the assessment of database growth was downgraded to "unlikely." This work is captured in [#319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/319) and [#321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/321).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Nonceless Execution**: A new pull request, [#322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/322), was opened to discuss nonceless execution.
- **Decoupled Features Addendum**: Another pull request, [#323](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/323), was opened to add an addendum on MinBaseFee and the rationale behind why toggles are not always suitable.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Minimum Base Fee State Growth Estimate
The issue [#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/316), which requested the addition of a state growth estimate to the FMA for `min-base-fee`, was closed today. This issue was addressed by the updates in the `min-base-fee` documentation.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-challenger acceptance tests on interop
Issue [#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15948) was reopened today by mbaxter, noting that there are still a few TODOs pointing to this ticket that need to be addressed. The issue aims to add acceptance tests for `op-challenger` functionality on interop chains, specifically covering invalid proposal disputes and game resolution. Previous discussions included how acceptance tests can identify the `op-challenger`'s EOA to assert that invalid proposals were disputed by it.

### op-sync-tester: Support eth namespace
Issue [#16700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16700) was reopened by pcw109550 to track the implementation of test cases for the `eth` namespace. The issue focuses on enabling `op-sync-tester` to serve RPC methods like `eth_getBlockReceipts`, `eth_getBlockByHash`, and `eth_getBlockByNumber` for blocks prior to the `test_head`.
