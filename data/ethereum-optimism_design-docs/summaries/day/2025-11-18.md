## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop and Sync Mechanism Refinements
Multiple issues related to Interop and sync mechanisms were reopened due to outstanding TODOs in the codebase. These include fixing the `op-devstack` address book ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15817)), dropping multi-node support in `op-supervisor` ([#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16174)), removing the anchor point RPC for Interop ([#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16140)), and ensuring `op-node`'s sync-start does not cross into Interop activation ([#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16141)). Additionally, the issue concerning the removal of the `op-supervisor`'s backward compatibility chainID fallback ([#16245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16245)) was reopened. The "Clean up Event System Refactor Comments" issue ([#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16917)) was also reopened due to remaining TODOs.

### EL Sync and Safe Head Advancement
Discussions on issues related to EL Sync and Safe Head Advancement, such as "op-node: On the Initial EL Sync UX and Correctness" ([#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17631)), "op-node: Safe Head Advancement during EL Sync" ([#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18124)), and "op-node: Unsafe not rewound while `INVALID` during EL Sync" ([#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18125)), indicate that these are being punted until the full deprecation of req/res sync.

### Fusaka-on-L2 Design Finalization
The "fusaka-on-l2: finalize design" issue ([#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/355)) is awaiting finalization after checking with customers.
