# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Nov 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on addressing and re-opening several issues related to the `op-node` and `op-supervisor` components, particularly concerning Interop activation and event system refactoring. A new pull request was opened to update the recovery path for hardfork activation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

- **Hardfork Activation Recovery Path:** A new pull request was opened to update the recovery path for hardfork activation, indicating ongoing work on protocol security and decentralization. ([#357](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/357))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#357](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/357) titled "Update recovery path for hardfork activation," was opened. Its status is new and awaiting review.

## CLOSED ISSUES

- **Superchain Registry Enhancements:** Several issues related to the Superchain Registry (SCR) 2.0 refactor were closed, indicating progress in streamlining chain management and CI processes. This includes modifications to the `add-chain` tool to allow chains to opt into hardforks ([#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/610)), investigation of L2 key handover tests ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/643)), and updates to the `golang-validate-all` CI job for better pass/fail summaries ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/644)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Interop Activation and Sync-Start Logic:** Issue [#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16141) ("op-node: Let sync-start not cross into Interop activation") was re-opened by ajsutton, noting that a TODO referencing it still exists in the code. This highlights an ongoing need to ensure `op-node`'s sync-start algorithm correctly handles Interop activation boundaries.
- **Event System Refactor Cleanup:** Issue [#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16917) ("Clean up Event System Refactor Comments") was re-opened by ajsutton due to remaining TODOs in the code. This indicates that the cleanup of comments related to the event system refactor is still in progress.
- **Supervisor Multi-Node Support and RPC Removal:** Issue [#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16174) ("op-supervisor: Drop multi-node support") was re-opened by ajsutton, citing a remaining TODO in the code. Similarly, issue [#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16140) ("Interop: Remove anchor point RPC") was re-opened by ajsutton due to existing TODOs. These re-openings suggest that further work is needed to fully deprecate multi-node support in the supervisor and remove the anchor point RPC.
- **Supervisor Backward Compatibility:** Issue [#16245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16245) ("op-supervisor: remove check-access-list backward compat chainID fallback") was re-opened by ajsutton, indicating that the removal of backward compatibility for the `check-access-list` chainID fallback is still pending.
- **EL Sync UX and Correctness:** Issue [#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17631) ("op-node: On the Initial EL Sync UX and Correctness") received a comment from mslipper, stating that this issue should be addressed once request/response sync is fully deprecated. This suggests a dependency on other ongoing work.
- **Safe Head Advancement and Unsafe Rewind during EL Sync:** Issues [#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18124) ("op-node: Safe Head Advancement during EL Sync") and [#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18125) ("op-node: Unsafe not rewound while `INVALID` during EL Sync") both received comments from mslipper, indicating that these can be punted until request/response sync is fully deprecated.
- **Fusaka-on-L2 Design Finalization:** Issue [#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/355) ("fusaka-on-l2: finalize design") received a comment from mslipper, stating that the design will be finalized after checking with customers. This indicates that customer feedback is a key factor in the next steps for this design.
