# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Sep 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on closing out several issues related to flashblocks RPC deployment and load testing, as well as clarifying conditions for L2EL syncing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Flashblocks Deployment & Testing
- Deployment of a flashblocks-rpc node was completed, identified as `op-opn-reth-f-fb-0` [#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16764).
- Load tests for the `rollup-boost flashblocks forwarder` were performed, and results were documented, including a note on inflated latency due to testing location [#17462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17462).

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### L2CL<>L2EL Syncing Conditions
Discussion on [#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17628) revolved around the conditions for L2 Execution Layer (EL) to start syncing. Key points from the latest comments include:
- @pcw109550 agreed with previous comments, suggesting refinement of the ticket to avoid leaking EL implementation details and acknowledging a misunderstanding about triggering snap-sync twice.
- @sebastianst clarified that EL clients primarily need p2p connections to other nodes and a FCU call to set new sync targets to backfill blocks, not necessarily snap-sync.
- @ajsutton emphasized that op-geth will still sync even if it doesn't trigger snap sync after a finalized sync, and the main concern is for the EL to reach the new chain head, regardless of the sync mechanism.
