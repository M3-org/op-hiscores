## CLOSED ISSUES

### Sequencer Stability and Recovery
Several issues concerning sequencer behavior and recovery mechanisms were closed. This includes the recovery from sequence window expiration incidents ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/11228)) and sequencer halting on temporary errors ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/12240)). These issues were closed as they were either resolved or deemed no longer relevant.

### Node Operation and Package Updates
An issue regarding the inability to start a new node with `op-node` ([#15411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15411)) was closed, with the assumption that it was resolved. Additionally, a request to update the `@eth-optimism/contracts-bedrock` NPM package ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/13459)) was closed, as the NPM packages are no longer being updated.

### Test Porting
An acceptance issue to port `TestChainFork` to `devstack` ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/413)) was closed, as it was implemented in a related pull request.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Recovery from sequence window expiration incident ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/11228))
This issue, concerning the recovery process when the `op-batcher` stops and the sequence window expires, was closed by mslipper, who requested it be reopened if still relevant. Earlier discussions included the implementation of "recover mode" in [#13550](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/13550) and considerations for manual intervention. The automatic handling of blob congestion by the batcher was also noted.

### Sequencer halting on temporary error ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/12240))
This issue, detailing instances where the sequencer halts due to temporary errors, was closed by mslipper, with a request to reopen if the issue persists. Previous comments highlighted similar experiences with sequencer halts when L1 becomes unavailable and a potential fix implemented in [#12258](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/12258).

### Update NPM Package: @eth-optimism/contracts-bedrock ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/13459))
This issue, requesting an update to the `@eth-optimism/contracts-bedrock` NPM package, was closed by mslipper, stating that the NPM packages are no longer being updated.
