# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Aug 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in closing out several long-standing issues related to proofs, acceptance testing, and event system cleanup. Efforts are ongoing to improve contract verification processes.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES

**Proofs System and Acceptance Testing Finalization**
The work on interop acceptance testing for the proofs system has been completed and closed. This includes the finalization of `op-challenger` acceptance tests for interop chains, ensuring the functionality for disputing invalid proposals.
- [#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15946)
- [#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15948)

**Event System Cleanup**
Two events have been successfully removed from the event system, streamlining the codebase.

**Test Target Setup Refinement**
An issue concerning the incorporation of test target setup/teardown as an `op-acceptor` concern was closed, with the rationale that Kurtosis is no longer considered critical for network testing compared to `sysgo`.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Contract Verification Improvements**
Discussion on [#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/14813) highlights the ongoing effort to enhance contract verification. The latest comment from `bitwise` suggests revisiting `op-deployer` contract verification to leverage `forge verify-contract` once `forge` binary support is implemented. This aims to reduce custom verification code and streamline the process for both Etherscan and Blockscout. Earlier discussions also considered integrating with Sourcify for broader block explorer compatibility.
