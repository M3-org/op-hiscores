### Node Synchronization Problems
A new issue, [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18581), was opened reporting that "the node is not synchronized." Users are experiencing "missing trie node ... is not available" and "Failed to build payload" errors, suggesting that the L1 Execution Client (e.g., Geth or Erigon) is failing to provide necessary state data to the Op-Node for L2 block creation. One user noted similar problems with Publicnode snapshots but found success with `snapsync` using `--syncmode=execution-layer` for a new Unichain node. Another user reported the same errors across multiple nodes on Base, Optimism, and Unichain, running `op-geth v1.101603.5 jovian` with `op-node v1.16.3`, and attempting to sync with Publicnode snapshots. There's speculation among users that Optimism and Arbitrum are down and that a client update might be needed. A maintainer has requested more information, including client configurations (L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client), full logs for Op-Node and L1 Execution Client, and complete startup flags for all three clients, to diagnose the problem further.
