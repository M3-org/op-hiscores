## NEW ISSUES
### Node Synchronization Problems
A new issue, [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18581), was opened reporting that the node is not synchronized. This issue highlights potential problems with L1 Execution Client data provision to Op-Node, leading to failures in L2 block creation.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Node Synchronization Failure Investigation
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18581), "the node is not synchronized," was opened today and quickly garnered significant discussion. Users reported similar errors across Base, Optimism, and Unichain, specifically "missing trie node ... is not available" and "Failed to build payload." Initial reports suggest issues when syncing with snapshots from publicnode.com, though one user noted that `snapsync` with `--syncmode=execution-layer` worked for a new Unichain node. There's speculation about a need for a client update. The latest comment from rdin777 (Dec 15) requests detailed information from the reporter, @yaki-1337, including client configurations (L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client), full logs for Op-Node and L1 Execution Client, and complete startup flags for all three clients, to aid in diagnosing the problem.
