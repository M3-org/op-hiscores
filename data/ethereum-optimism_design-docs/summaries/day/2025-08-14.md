Discussion continued on [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16874), which aims to add logic to trace event flow. On Aug 14, 2025, @sashass1315 informed @pcw109550 that a PR had been added for review. On Aug 15, 2025, @pcw109550 responded, stating that while the contribution was appreciated, the team is leaning towards removing the entire event system, suggesting the PR might not be merged, though the code could still be useful for control flow analysis during the system's removal.
