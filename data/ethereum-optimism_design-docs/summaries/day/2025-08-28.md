## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Documentation for `op-deployer`
Discussion on [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/1530) continued with a new comment from krofax, who highlighted a "rich PR" ([#1705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705)) that overhauls the existing "Create an op stack Rollup testnet with op-deployer" documentation. This suggests ongoing efforts to improve the clarity and accuracy of deployment guides.

### Monorepo CI for `op-geth` PRs
The discussion on [#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/665) saw a new comment from ajsutton proposing "Option C": a periodic job in the monorepo to check for the latest `op-geth` commit from the optimism branch. This job would notify via Slack if it fails, aiming to quickly alert to integration issues, though it might produce false alarms between `op-geth` and monorepo PR merges.

### Flashblock Tests for Persistent Devnets
Stevmark11 commented on [#17248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17248), reiterating the need to enable flashblock tests against persistent devnets. The comment emphasizes that the necessary gate is already in place, and the primary task is to ensure its correct functionality, classifying it as an XS-S task size.
