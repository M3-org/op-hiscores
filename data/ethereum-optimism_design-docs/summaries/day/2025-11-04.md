# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on documentation enhancements, specifically updating the custom gas token design. Discussions on active issues covered `proxyd` behavior with out-of-sync backends, blob priority fee tracking for `op-batcher/txmgr`, and updates to the `migrate` method.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Updates

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Proxyd Backend Synchronization Challenges
Discussions around [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/501) highlighted that `proxyd` can exhibit "backwards time travel" when its backends are not synchronized, potentially affecting `eth_call`, `eth_estimateGas`, and `eth_feeHistory`. Several approaches were brainstormed to address this, including a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, `proxyd` silently falling back to other backends on "block out of range" errors, and IP-based or signature-based sticky sessions. The "multicall" strategy was noted for its simplicity but increases `eth_call` request forwarding.

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking for Batcher
Issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102) concerns the `op-batcher/txmgr`'s blob priority fee tracking. A suggestion was made to have the starting priority fee for new transactions "decay" from the previous transaction rather than always resetting, which could improve backlog handling. However, a more comprehensive solution involving a dedicated blob priority fee tracker that initializes at startup was also discussed as a larger but more robust lift.

### Update `migrate` Method
Discussion on [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17743) clarified that this issue specifically tracks OPCM changes related to the `migrate` method. It was noted that a separate issue ([#17764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17764)) covers the corresponding devstack changes, suggesting that this issue might be ready for closure.
