## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking in op-batcher/txmgr
Discussion on [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102) focused on methods for tracking blob priority fees. A suggestion was made to have the starting priority fee for new transactions "decay" from the previous transaction to improve backlog handling, though it was noted this might be a less comprehensive solution than a dedicated blob priority fee tracker. The potential downside of a tracker restarting after an incident was also mentioned.

### Proxyd Backend Synchronization Issues
On [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/501), several approaches were brainstormed to address `proxyd` returning previous blocks when backends are out of sync, leading to "backwards time travel." Proposed solutions include a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, `proxyd` handling "block out of range" errors by falling back to other backends, and IP-based or signature-based sticky sessions. The trade-offs of each approach regarding complexity, performance, and client-side changes were discussed.

### op-acceptance-tests for Flashblocks/Rbuilders
Issue [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16450) highlights that `sysgo` currently does not support flashblocks/rbuilders, preventing related tests. A comment indicated a desire to implement this to validate the `kona-node` and `rollup-boost` changes.
