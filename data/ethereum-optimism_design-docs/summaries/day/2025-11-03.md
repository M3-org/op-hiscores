## ACTIVE ISSUES
### DA Footprint Limit Documentation
Discussion continued on documenting the DA Footprint Limit [#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/1742). The latest comment suggests that this issue could be tracked alongside the documentation of the MinBaseFee feature, as it is considered self-explanatory. The issue emphasizes the importance of documenting the risks associated with setting the scalar too high or too low, and its relationship to changes in the Gas Limit.
