### Kona + Cannon Support in OPCM
Discussion on [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17285) revolves around the necessary changes in OPCM to support Kona + Cannon. The latest comment from ajsutton clarifies that OPCM needs to support deploying the new game type, specifically highlighting an `if` block in `OPContractsManager.sol` that will require updates. Earlier, pauldowman suggested confirming if any action is truly needed before closing the issue.

### Kona + Cannon Support in op-dispute-mon
Issue [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17286) focuses on updating `op-dispute-mon` to support Kona + Cannon game types. The latest comment from pauldowman indicates the issue description was changed to "Update to support cannon-kona games." Previously, ajsutton emphasized that `dispute-mon` must return an error for unsupported game types and will need to be updated to explicitly support cannon-kana game types.
