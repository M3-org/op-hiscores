## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened today:
- A proposal for a [Reactive Security Council](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/327) was initiated.
- A feature to [add a fee splitter](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/328) was introduced.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Internal Tooling and Event System Refinements
Several issues related to internal tooling and event handling were closed. This includes the closure of [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16874) concerning an "Event Call Graph" for `op-service`, as the team is leaning towards removing the entire event system. Additionally, [#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17151) regarding "Missing test logs" in `op-acceptance-tests` was closed as the logs were located.

### Logging and Postmortem Documentation
Issues related to logging and postmortem analysis were addressed. [#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17007) on cleaning up `op-up` logging was closed, as it was deemed not worthwhile without `op-geth` eliminating global logger use. The postmortem for a "Scalar fix" in [#17012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17012) was also closed, indicating its completion.

### Consensus-Influencing Event Nonces
The tracking issue [#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/13543) concerning "Consensus influencing event nonces" was closed, with the rationale that its implementation is not planned for the time being.
