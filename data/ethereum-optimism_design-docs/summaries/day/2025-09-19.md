# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Sep 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the closure of an issue concerning redundant address structs and the opening of a new issue to establish a convention for network upgrade transactions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Address Struct Consolidation
An issue to create a single source of truth for address structs, aiming to eliminate duplication across various packages, has been closed. The intended scope of this work was completed. [#14977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/14977)

## NEW ISSUES
### Network Upgrade Transaction Convention
A new issue has been opened to enshrine a new convention for Network Upgrade Transactions that deploy new contracts. The current practice of choosing a unique `from` address with `nonce=0` affects deployment addresses and needs a more robust convention. [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/781)

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Enshrine new convention for Network Upgrade Transactions which deploy new contracts [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/781)
Discussion on this newly opened issue focuses on the address collision resistance of the proposed convention. A note highlights that `CREATE`, `CREATE2`, and upgrade source-hash computations use different keccak preimage starts, preventing collisions. A suggestion was made to use the `CREATE2` computation with a system address as the deployer and the source-hash as the salt for extra safety and to fit within existing address computation frameworks.
