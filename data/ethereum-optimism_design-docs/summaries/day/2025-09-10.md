# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Sep 10, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on clarifying the dispute game creators design document and closing several Kurtosis-related issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dispute Game Documentation Refinement
* The `dispute-game-creators` design document was reorganized to enhance clarity and better explain its purpose ([#331](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/331)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kurtosis Devnet Enhancements and Deprioritization
* Several issues related to the Kurtosis devnet were closed, with the rationale that they are either largely completed or no longer a priority. This includes issues concerning genesis checks ([#15753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15753)), idempotency and performance improvements ([#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/14390)), L1 chain config extraction ([#15050](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15050)), proxyd tests ([#15558](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15558)), and a rotatory welcome message feature ([#15511](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15511)).
* An issue investigating selective service selection in Kurtosis devnet was closed as it will not be implemented ([#15537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15537)).
* Kurtosis support for `op-validator` was closed as it will not be implemented ([#16712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16712)).

### Infrastructure Threat Modeling
* An issue regarding infra threat modeling related to flashblocks delivery was closed after a discussion concluded that while improvements are needed for reliability and security, there is no novel risk beyond what is already accepted for other images. The best short-term mitigation is to hardcode image digests in Kubernetes deployment manifests ([#17144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17144)).

### Dispute Game Implementation
* An issue to use v2 dispute game implementations in `OPCM.addGameType` was closed as a duplicate of another issue ([#17259](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17259)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Op-Program Optimization
* A new issue was opened to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program` to provide key information before looking up a block hash by number ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17416)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis Reverse Proxy Websockets Support
Discussion on [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17194) indicates that the feature to implement Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy will not be implemented. However, the issue remains open as there is a pending TODO in the code that references it, and it needs to be removed before the issue can be fully closed.
