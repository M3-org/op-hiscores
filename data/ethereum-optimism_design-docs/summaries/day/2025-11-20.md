# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on the addition of a new design document for "fusaka on L2" and the closure of two issues, including one related to finalizing the "fusaka on L2" design and another concerning a runbook for low batcher throughput. A new issue was also opened regarding the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Protocol Design Documentation
A new design document, "fusaka on L2," was added to the `protocol` directory, outlining the implementation details for this feature within the Optimism ecosystem ([#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/354)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fusaka on L2 Design Finalization
The issue concerning the finalization of the "fusaka on L2" design was closed today ([#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/355)). This closure follows a previous comment indicating that the design would be finalized after customer checks.

### Min-Base-Fee Runbook for Low Batcher Throughput
The issue related to creating a runbook for low batcher throughput when the `min-base-fee` is too high was closed today ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16959)). A runbook has been created to address this scenario.

## NEW ISSUES

### Dispute Game Dependency Refinement
A new issue was opened to discuss the removal of the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry` ([#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18347)). The current setup, which checks if `anchorStateRegistry()` from the dispute game matches the `AnchorStateRegistry` itself via a cast to `IFaultDisputeGame`, may not work for all game types.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Remove IFaultDisputeGame dependency from AnchorStateRegistry ([#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18347))
Discussion revolves around the necessity and implications of the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency in `AnchorStateRegistry`. One perspective questions the need for the sanity check, suggesting that deployment-time checks via `OPStandardValidator` might suffice. Another comment acknowledges that adding `wasRespectedAtGameCreation` has already tied dispute game implementations to the anchor state registry, potentially making the current dependency less problematic. A third comment proposes expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface to include an `AnchorStateRegistry` method, maintaining the sanity check while addressing the dependency concern.
