# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on the addition of a new design document for "fusaka on L2" and the closure of two issues, including one related to finalizing the fusaka design and another concerning a runbook for low batcher throughput.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Protocol Design Documentation
A new design document, "fusaka on L2," was added to the `protocol` directory, outlining the implementation details for this feature within the Optimism ecosystem ([#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/354)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fusaka Design Finalization
The issue concerning the finalization of the "fusaka-on-l2" design was closed today ([#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/355)). This issue was closed after the design document was added.

### Batcher Throughput Runbook
An issue related to creating a runbook for low batcher throughput due to a high `MinBaseFee` was closed today ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16959)). A runbook has been created to address this scenario.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### IFaultDisputeGame Dependency in AnchorStateRegistry
Discussion continues on the issue of removing the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry` ([#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18347)). The core of the discussion revolves around the necessity of a sanity check that verifies the `anchorStateRegistry()` from the dispute game matches the `AnchorStateRegistry` itself. While it's acknowledged that adding `wasRespectedAtGameCreation` ties dispute game implementations to the anchor state registry, the question remains whether the sanity check is truly essential given deployment-time checks. A suggestion was made to expand the `IDisputeGame` interface to require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method to maintain the sanity check.
