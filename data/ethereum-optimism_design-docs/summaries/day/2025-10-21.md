## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Fusaka Preparation and Prestate Updates**
    *   Discussion on [#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/1206) confirmed that the Superchain-ops task for updating the absolute prestate has been completed and executed on Sepolia. The question remains whether to keep the issue open to track the Mainnet task.
    *   Regarding [#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/682), it was clarified that the `op-geth` upstream merge to Fusaka for Sepolia is done, but not yet for Mainnet.

*   **Mise Installation Error**
    *   Issue [#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17963) reports an Optimism `mise` install error due to a version pre-fix "v" character appearing during URL formatting. The latest comment suggests that this is an issue with the current `mise` version and recommends using the install script from the latest `develop` branch of the Optimism repository, which provides a compatible `mise` version.
