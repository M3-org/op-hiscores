## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fusaka Preparation and Deployment
Discussions continued regarding the `op-geth` preparation for Fusaka ([#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/682)). It was confirmed that the Sepolia deployment is complete, but the Mainnet deployment is still pending. Similarly, the task for updating the absolute prestate for Fusaka defense ([#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/1206)) has been executed on Sepolia, with a question raised about keeping the ticket open to track the Mainnet task.

### Developer Tooling and Environment Setup
An issue concerning an Optimism `mise install` error due to a version prefix "v" ([#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17963)) received a comment suggesting that the problem lies with the latest version of `mise`. The recommended solution is to use the `install_mise.sh` script from the latest develop branch of the `optimism` repository, which utilizes a compatible `mise` version.

### Observability in Devnets
The issue regarding enabling observability/monitoring in `sysgo` ([#17941](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17941)) received a comment suggesting it might be a duplicate of an existing issue in the main `optimism` repository.
