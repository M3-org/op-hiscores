### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerting Improvements
Discussion on [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16388) continued with a new comment from yashvardhan-kukreja linking to an associated PR in the `k8s` repository. Previous discussions outlined rough notes for monitoring and alerting, including peer count, block progression SLAs, pending transaction thresholds, flashblocks-related SLA metrics, and monitoring for `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` connections and `flashblocks-rpc` node-reth metrics. The discussion also touched upon inheriting `op-node` alerts and metrics for `op-node-rbuilder`.
