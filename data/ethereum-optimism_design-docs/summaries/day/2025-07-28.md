## NEW ISSUES

### Congestion-Based Transaction Reordering
A new issue, [#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/306), was opened to request a design document on congestion-based builder transaction reordering. The idea involves tracking excess DA usage over time with an exponential cost/score penalty, potentially implemented outside the protocol to test the concept for L1 congestion cost.
