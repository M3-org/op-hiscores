# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on simplifying the Kona node actor design for improved complexity and testability. Additionally, two long-standing issues related to blob priority fee tracking and a potential bug in op-node sequencer recovery mode were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Protocol Simplification
A proposal was introduced to simplify the Kona node actor design, aiming to decrease complexity and increase testability by consolidating and deleting unnecessary code without altering functionality [#358](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/358).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking
The issue concerning blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr` was closed today [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102). The discussion highlighted that the blob tip oracle is now deployed to production, suggesting a priority fee lower than the configured minimum, indicating potential overpayment.

### Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug
A potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer recovery mode was closed [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18350). While the original drift issue could not be reproduced, related refactoring of the L1 origin code in `op-node` and a fix for not erroring when the L1 origin is up to tip were implemented.

## NEW ISSUES

### Artifact Extraction Path Discrepancy
A new bug was reported regarding `ExtractFromFile()` in `op-deployer/pkg/deployer/artifacts/embedded.go`, which expects an `out/` directory but should expect `forge-artifacts/`. This discrepancy breaks self-hosted `.tzst` artifacts [#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18663).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102)
The latest comment from "nonsense" confirms that the blob tip oracle is now deployed to production. The oracle suggests a priority fee of approximately `2.51 gwei`, which is lower than the current configured minimum of `4 gwei`, leading to a `WARN` log about the suggested `blobTipCap` being lower than the configured minimum. This indicates that the system is currently overpaying for blob transactions, and there's a need to utilize the oracle's suggestions soon.

### Possible Bug in op-node Sequencer Recover Mode [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18350)
The issue was closed by "geoknee" who stated that the drift issue could not be reproduced. However, related refactoring of the L1 origin code in `op-node` and a similar fix to avoid errors when the L1 origin is up to tip were implemented. The issue may be reopened if the drift issue reoccurs. Previous discussions highlighted that in recover mode, the sequencer might request a non-existent L1 origin block, leading to "not found" errors and potentially violating the sequencer drift rule, which could stall derivation. A possible fix snippet was proposed by "sebastianst" to prevent temporary errors when recovery mode reaches the tip.
