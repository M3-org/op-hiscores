# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on simplifying the Kona node actor design to improve complexity and testability. Additionally, two long-standing issues related to blob priority fee tracking and a potential bug in op-node sequencer recovery mode were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Protocol Simplification
A proposal was introduced to simplify the Kona node actor design, aiming to decrease complexity and increase testability by consolidating and deleting unnecessary code without altering functionality. [#358](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/358)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking
The issue concerning blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr` was closed. Discussions highlighted that the blob tip oracle is now deployed to production, suggesting a priority fee lower than the configured minimum, indicating potential overpayment. [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102)

### Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug Investigation
A potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer recovery mode was closed. Although the specific drift issue could not be reproduced, related L1 origin code was refactored, and a fix was adopted to prevent errors when the L1 origin is up to tip. [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18350)

## NEW ISSUES

### Artifact Extraction Path Discrepancy
A new bug was reported regarding `ExtractFromFile()` in `op-deployer/pkg/deployer/artifacts/embedded.go`, which expects an `out/` directory but should expect `forge-artifacts/`. This discrepancy breaks self-hosted `.tzst` artifacts due to how `mktar` packages artifacts. [#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18663)

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Blob priority fee tracking [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102)
The issue was closed today. The latest comment from `nonsense` confirms that the blob tip oracle is now deployed to production and suggests that the `op-batcher` is currently overpaying for blob transactions, as the oracle recommends a lower priority fee than the configured minimum. This indicates a need to integrate the oracle's suggestions into the batcher's fee calculation.

### possible bug in op-node sequencer recover mode [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18350)
This issue was also closed today. The final comment from `geoknee` states that the reported drift issue could not be reproduced. However, the L1 origin code in `op-node` was refactored, and a fix was implemented to prevent errors when the L1 origin is up to tip. The issue may be reopened if the drift problem reoccurs.
