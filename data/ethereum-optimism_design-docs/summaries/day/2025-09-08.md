# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Sep 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, a new feature was added to enhance security with FMA for u16a. Additionally, two issues related to op-batcher throttling and op-geth initialization with large genesis files were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Security Enhancements
A new feature was introduced to add FMA (Fused Multiply-Add) for u16a, improving security within the system. ([#334](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/334))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### op-batcher Throttling Improvement
The issue regarding improving the throttling intensity metric for op-batcher was closed. The proposed solution involves only setting the metric for the active controller, making it easier to visualize in Grafana. ([#17149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17149))

### op-geth Genesis File Initialization
The issue concerning op-geth initialization with large genesis files and a LevelDB panic was closed. The discussion highlighted that the Genesis-State-Spec is optional and does not need to be stored in geth, suggesting a modification to op-geth for one-time state import and including the `stateHash` in the chain-`config` for fresh nodes. ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/668))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis: Ability to use local op-geth build
Discussion on [#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16975) suggests leveraging the templating system to automatically override the op-geth build. This could involve resolving `image: {{ $remote_images.op-geth-go-mod }}` to a Docker image URL constructed from the githash in `go.mod`, or allowing the source code to be cloned temporarily and a local Docker image built.
