# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Sep 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in security module design with new proposals for liveness and timelock guards. Several issues related to flashblocks integration and sync-tester development were closed, indicating advancements in monitoring, alerting, and testing infrastructure.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Safe Module Enhancements
New design documents were introduced for enhancing the security and operational robustness of safes. This includes a proposal for an updated LivenessModule to be installed across various managed safes and a new TimelockGuard proposal for controlled access.
- [#320](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/320)
- [#324](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/324)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/335), was opened to add a design document for the Kurtosis to Sysgo migration.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Integration and Sequencer Management
Several issues related to flashblocks integration and sequencer management in mainnet were closed. This includes the creation of a new sequencer to ensure an odd number of voters in the Raft conductor set and the removal of a non-flashblocks oriented sequencer from the voter set.

## NEW ISSUES

### Data Availability Footprint Analysis
A new issue, [#336](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/336), was opened to conduct threat modeling and failure modes analysis for the DA Footprint Limit.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerting Improvements
Discussions on [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16388) indicate that the monitoring dashboard for flashblocks has been completed, and remaining alerting PRs have been raised. Previous discussions outlined detailed requirements for monitoring peer count, block progression, pending transactions, and flashblocks-specific metrics.

### Sync-Tester Nightly CI Job
Issue [#17253](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17253) is tracking the addition of nightly CI jobs to test `op-node` (or other CLs) using the sync tester. The latest comment notes that enabling mainnet sync testing is currently blocked by another infrastructure issue.

### Acceptance Tests in Persistent Devnets
On [#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/398), the latest comment highlights that some acceptance tests are still failing on Eris, with new tickets created to follow up on `TestERC20Bridge` and `TestOperatorFeeDevstack`. Previous updates included adding L1 Faucet support.
