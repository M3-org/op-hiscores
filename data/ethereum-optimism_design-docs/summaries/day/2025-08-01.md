# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Aug 1, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on refining the operator fee formula with a new scalar fix. A new pull request was opened to address custom gas token migration. Discussions continued on tracking the Min Base Fee and estimating state growth for a related feature.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Protocol Fee Formula Refinement
A new feature was added to fix the operator fee scalar, refining the `operatorFee` calculation within the protocol. This update introduces a more precise formula for operator fees. ([#299](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/299))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#313](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/313), was opened to add custom gas token migration functionality.

### Min Base Fee Tracking and Specification
Discussions continued on tracking the Min Base Fee ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16807)). The latest comment from wlawt on August 1st, 2025, shared an early reth draft ([https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/17704](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/17704)) to gather early feedback and insights. Previous comments from July 28th, 2025, also by wlawt, highlighted other related in-flight work, including updates to op-alloy and optimism repositories.

### Min Base Fee Specification and State Growth Estimation
The issue concerning the specification of the min-base-fee ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/742)) saw a new comment from geoknee on August 1st, 2025. This comment emphasized the need to compute a rough estimate for the state growth implied by this feature, suggesting its inclusion in the motivation section of the specifications. This estimation is now being tracked separately in [#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/316).
