## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Deprecating Req-Resp P2P Sync
Discussion continued on [#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/14108), which aims to remove the req-resp p2p sync. The latest comment from `tessr` provided extensive context and ideas from @emilianobonassi regarding an alternative unsafe block sync mechanism. This alternative is highlighted for being cheaper, simpler, faster for scale-out and recovery, and complementary to existing p2p methods. It proposes a centralized driver for gossiping blocks, where the sequencer leader publishes the latest unsafe block via Redis, and other nodes subscribe and inject it via the `admin_postUnsafePayload` API. On restarts, a sidecar checks sync status against the sequencer leader and queries the EL to fetch and inject blocks.
