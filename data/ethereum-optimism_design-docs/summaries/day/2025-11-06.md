# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Nov 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the introduction of a new design document for OPCM v2 and continued discussions on several active issues, including Go 1.25 compatibility for Cannon, `op-batcher` behavior with altDA, and `op-sync-tester` support for Jovian.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#353](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/353), was opened to introduce the OPCM v2 design document.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Audit of OPCM Changes
Issue [#17371](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17371), concerning the audit of OPCM changes for Kona and Cannon, was closed as it is now covered by another issue in the `optimism` repository.

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility
Discussion on [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17060) continued regarding Cannon's compatibility with Go 1.25. The latest comment from pauldowman indicates that the blocking issue has been fixed in Go 1.25.4, which addresses the incorrect keccak hashes and other crypto issues when running Cannon with Go 1.25.

### op-batcher and altDA Max Frame Size
Issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17796) discusses the `op-batcher` not limiting the max frame size to the max input size in generic mode for altDA. tessr commented that this issue has been addressed in a pull request in the `optimism` repository and asked if the issue could be closed.

### op-sync-tester Support for Jovian
On [#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18126), CreeptoGengar announced that a pull request has been made to address the need for `op-sync-tester` to support Jovian and add Jovian HF tests.

### op-batcher Rollup Config Synchronization
Issue [#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18178) focuses on the `op-batcher` staying in sync with the `op-node` rollup config. The discussion revolves around the current behavior where the `op-batcher` only fetches the rollup config once at startup. sebastianst and joshklop discussed potential solutions, including making the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher or having the batcher reload the config when the active endpoint changes. The current approach is considered brittle, and a new batcher release is needed for each Superchain Registry config change.
