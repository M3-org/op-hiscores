# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Nov 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the opening of a new pull request for OPCM v2 design documentation. Discussions continued on several active issues, including Go 1.25 compatibility for Cannon, `op-batcher` frame size limits, `op-sync-tester` support for Jovian, and `op-batcher`'s rollup config synchronization. One issue related to auditing OPCM changes was closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#353](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/353), was opened to introduce the OPCM v2 design document.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Audit of OPCM Changes
The issue concerning the audit of Kona + Cannon OPCM changes, [#17371](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17371), was closed as it is now covered by another issue in the `optimism` repository.

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility
Discussion on [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17060) continued regarding Cannon's compatibility with Go 1.25. The latest comment from `pauldowman` confirmed that the blocking issue has been fixed in Go 1.25.4, referencing a Go issue milestone. Previously, `ajsutton` had highlighted that all keccak hashes were incorrect with Go 1.25, impacting block hash calculations.

### op-batcher Frame Size Limits
On [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17796), `tessr` noted that the issue regarding `op-batcher` not limiting max frame size in generic mode for altDA was addressed in a pull request in the `optimism` repository. `nuke-web3` subsequently raised a point about updating the `specs` to reflect this change, as the current spec contains a false statement regarding `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE`.

### op-sync-tester Jovian Support
Regarding [#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18126), `CreeptoGengar` commented that a pull request has been made to address the need for `op-sync-tester` to support Jovian and add Jovian HF tests.

### op-batcher Rollup Config Synchronization
The discussion on [#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18178) focused on the `op-batcher`'s current behavior of fetching the rollup config only once at startup. `joshklop` suggested making the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher to make the dependency explicit. `sebastianst` agreed with this idea, noting its simplicity and consistency, and suggested that for Superchain Registry chains, the batcher could query the chain ID and load the config if not explicitly provided. However, `sebastianst` also pointed out the downside that this would necessitate a new batcher release for each Superchain Registry config change, which is not currently the case.
