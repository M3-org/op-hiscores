# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Sep 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw an update to the minimum base fee calculation in the FMA specification. Several Flashblocks-related issues received updates, and a new issue was opened regarding exposing more networks in the CI box for sync-tester.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### FMA Specification Updates
*   The calculation for the minimum base fee in the FMA specification was updated to reflect a change in design from 1 byte to 8 bytes for DB growth. ([#333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/333))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## NEW ISSUES
### Sync-Tester Network Exposure
*   A new issue was opened to expose more networks inside the CI box for the `op-sync-tester`, aiming to enable testing L2CL syncing with real chain data. ([#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/454))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Configuration
Discussions continued on several Flashblocks-related issues. For [#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16759) (enable flashblocks on prod-mainnet-op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-0), updates included associated PRs for `k8s` and outlined remaining tasks such as deploying `rollup-boost` in disabled mode and then enabling its execution mode based on stability observations. Similarly, for [#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16761) (enable flashblocks on sunnyside sequencers), the latest updates confirmed that both Sunnyside sequencers have `op-rbuilder` deployed and synced, with next steps involving deploying `rollup-boost` and a backup sequencer. Issue [#16763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16763) (deploy flashblocks-websocket-proxy) is currently blocked on the availability of websocket connections for conductors, though a PR is in progress to address this. For [#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16764) (deploy flashblocks-rpc node), there's a need to confirm its necessity. A new issue, [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17317) (enable flashblocks on op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-1 mainnet), was opened with associated PRs and a plan to deploy `rollup-boost` and enable its execution mode.

### Flashblocks Specification Finalization
Regarding [#17162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17162) ([FMA Action] Close out Flashblocks spec), associated PRs for the `specs` repository were noted, indicating ongoing work to finalize the Flashblocks specification.

### `op-node/p2p/gossip` Configuration Bug
Issue [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17308) (op-node/p2p/gossip - ConfigureGossip overwrites sane defaults with zero values) saw active discussion. The reporter clarified that the bug arises when updating `go-libp2p-pubsub` and that tests panic because `MeshDHi` defaults to 0, which is then clobbered by the `ConfigureGossip` function, leading to an invalid configuration. A maintainer questioned the approach of making invalid configs work and suggested adding a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to return a fully filled, valid configuration with sensible defaults.

### `op-geth` Initialization Error
Issue [#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/420) (op-geth init gives "head block is not reachable" error) received new comments from users experiencing the same error during `op-geth` initialization. One user suggested that the error might not be critical and to continue with the setup, while another noted that repeating the `geth init` step sometimes resolved it.

### Sync-Tester Network Exposure
On the newly opened issue [#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/454) ([sync-tester] Expose More Networks inside CI Box), there was a discussion about which L2 ELs are currently exposed in CI (mainnet and sepolia for unichain, ink, and base) and the remaining task of exposing an L1 beacon API in CI. A draft PR was mentioned that modifies the synctest to be more dynamic and take environment variables.
