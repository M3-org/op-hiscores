## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A first draft of the ZK Proofs design document has been opened for review [#356](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/356).

## CLOSED ISSUES
- **Kona Test Integration:** The issue concerning ensuring Kona has passing action tests for Jovian has been closed, with confirmation that Jovian action tests are now included in `op-e2e/actions/proofs` and run by Kona's CI [#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17303).

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Optimizing Safe-Head Advancement:** Discussion continued on the `op-node`'s single aggregate safe-head advancement FCU message per channel [#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15393). A recent merge was highlighted as potentially helpful for this issue. Previous comments discussed the frequency of FCU calls, the impact of `max-channel-duration`, and the potential for debouncing FCU calls.
- **Cannon-Kona Prestate Documentation:** The need to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades is being addressed [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18095). The latest update indicates that this requirement will be highlighted in Optimism's documentation, especially in light of the U18 upgrade.
- **Batcher Safeguard Improvements:** The issue of improving safeguards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig is under discussion [#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18246). A related issue concerning batcher configuration was also referenced.
