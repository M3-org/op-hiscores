## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/354), was opened to add a design document for "fusaka on L2".

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Flaky Test Resolution
The issue tracking the flaky test `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor`, [#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17548), was closed today. The issue was resolved as the test is no longer appearing in the top 100 flaky tests, indicating that the underlying problem has likely been fixed.

## NEW ISSUES
### Fusaka on L2 Design Finalization
A new issue, [#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/355), was created to finalize the design for "fusaka on L2".

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-batcher Max Frame Size Discussion
Discussions continued on [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17796), concerning the `op-batcher` not limiting max frame size to max input size in generic mode for altDA. The latest comment from nuke-web3 suggests that the relevant specification document should be updated to reflect the current implementation, as the existing spec might now be misleading regarding the `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` for `commitment_type == 0`. This follows a previous comment from tessr indicating that the issue was addressed in a pull request, and questioning if the issue could be closed.
