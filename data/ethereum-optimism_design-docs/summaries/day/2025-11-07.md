## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No completed work was reported for this period.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/354), was opened to add a design document for "fusaka on L2".

## CLOSED ISSUES

**Flaky Test Resolution**
The issue [#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17548), concerning the flaky `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` test, was closed. The issue was resolved as the test is no longer appearing in the top 100 flaky tests, suggesting the underlying problem has been fixed.

## NEW ISSUES

**Fusaka on L2 Design Finalization**
A new issue, [#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/355), was created to finalize the design for "fusaka on L2".

## ACTIVE ISSUES

**op-batcher Frame Size Limit Discussion**
Discussions continued on issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17796), which addresses whether `op-batcher` should limit the max frame size to the max input size in generic mode for altDA. The latest comment from nuke-web3 suggests that the spec should be updated to reflect the current implementation, as the existing spec statement regarding `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` is now considered false. This follows a previous comment from tessr indicating that the issue was addressed in a pull request ([#18074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074)) and questioning if the issue could be closed.
