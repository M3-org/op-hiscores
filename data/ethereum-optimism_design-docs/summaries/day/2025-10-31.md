## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **[#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16273) [op-acceptance-tests] Report unused tests**
    The latest comment from janjakubnanista asks if reporting unused tests is still a desired feature, following up on a previous discussion about a "staging" gate for tests.

*   **[#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16867) alert when non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off**
    zhwrd inquired if this ticket is still relevant or if there's an existing way to detect disabled flashblocks. jelias2 previously noted that an alert would be created once a specific PR landed.

*   **[#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17525) [op-acceptance-tests] Parallelise "memory-all" job**
    janjakubnanista questioned if this task is still needed, given that the PR intended to fix it was autoclosed.

*   **[#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/643) investigate L2 key handover test**
    janjakubnanista asked @bitwiseguy if this issue remains relevant after a recent refactor.

*   **[#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/501) proxyd: backwards time travel is possible when backends are not in sync**
    alfonso-op linked a related issue ([#17688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17688)) for more details on the `proxyd` "time travel" problem.
