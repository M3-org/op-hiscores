This includes overhauling how fault proofs contract addresses are stored and discovered [#604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/604), adding chain names to `addresses.json` [#999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/999), and adding verification guides to OP docs for `op-deployer` [#17145](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17145).

## NEW ISSUES

### Proxyd Time Travel Anomaly
A new issue was opened regarding Proxyd's ability to "travel back in time" and return previous blocks as the `unsafe` block when backends are not in sync [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/501).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   [#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16273) [op-acceptance-tests] Report unused tests: The latest comment from janjakubnanista asks if reporting unused acceptance tests is still a desired feature, following up on a previous discussion about a special "staging" gate for tests.
*   [#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16867) alert when non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off: The latest comment from zhwrd questions the current relevance of this ticket and whether a detection mechanism for disabled flashblocks already exists.
*   [#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17525) [op-acceptance-tests] Parallelise "memory-all" job: janjakubnanista's latest comment inquires if parallelizing the "memory-all" job is still necessary, given that the PR intended to fix it was autoclosed.
*   [#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/643) investigate L2 key handover test: janjakubnanista asks if this issue remains relevant after the recent refactor.
*   [#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/644) ci: update `golang-validate-all` job to give summary of passes/failures: janjakubnanista questions if this issue has been addressed by SCR 2.0.
*   [#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/675) encode ProxyAdminOwner exceptions for Base and Unichain: janjakubnanista believes this has been addressed with SCR 2.0 and seeks confirmation from @bitwiseguy.
