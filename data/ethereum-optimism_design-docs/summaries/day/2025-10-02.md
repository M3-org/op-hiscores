### L2EL Sync Condition Clarified
An issue investigating the conditions for L2EL to start EL Syncing has been closed.

### Acceptance Test Output Enhanced
The issue to include setup information in the HTML output of `op-acceptor` has been closed, with the work completed in a related infrastructure pull request. This improves the diagnostic capabilities of acceptance tests. ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/386))

## NEW ISSUES

### Terminology Consistency
A new issue has been opened to address the inconsistent use of "soft-fork" versus "hard-fork" terminology within the design documentation, aiming for greater clarity and precision. ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/342))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### cannon: Support go1.25 ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17060))
Discussion continues regarding the compatibility of Cannon with Go 1.25. @pauldowman confirmed that the issue affects Optimism, and @ajsutton provided further context, noting that all Keccak hashes are incorrect when running Cannon with Go 1.25, impacting block hash calculations. The blocking issue in the Go repository has been linked for reference.

### op-acceptance-test: add back op-reth to jovian kt-devnet ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17475))
The latest comment from @geoknee suggests a shift in strategy for integrating `op-reth`. Given that Kurtosis devnet is deprecated, the focus should now be on integrating `op-reth` into the `devstack / sysgo` system instead of adding it back to the Jovian Kurtosis devnet.
