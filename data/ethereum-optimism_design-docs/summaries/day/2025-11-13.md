# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Nov 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on introducing a new design document for L2 Contract Management, aiming for deterministic and hard fork-driven upgrades. Additionally, several issues were closed, including one related to `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` support for `sysext`, and another tracking support for embedded custom prestates in Kona. Discussions continued on updating the `print_staging_report` script for dispute-game v2 compatibility.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### L2 Contract Management Design
A new design document was added to outline a strategy for deterministic, well-tested, and hard fork-driven upgrades of L2 contracts, with both implementation and upgrade paths defined in Solidity. This aims to improve the upgrade process for protocol developers. [#351](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/351)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Reports
Discussions continued regarding updating the `print_staging_report` script to be compatible with dispute-game v2 [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/1148). Key points raised include adapting the script to read `gameArgs` from the DGF if available, as the current script reads them from the game implementation contract. There's also a concern that the script assumes only a Permissioned and Permissionless game, while there will eventually be two permissionless games, which might impact the JSON output and potentially cause disruption.
