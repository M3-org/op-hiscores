# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Nov 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on documenting L2 contract management and upgrades, alongside discussions on supporting embedded custom prestates and adapting the `print_staging_report` script for dispute-game v2 compatibility.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### L2 Contract Management Documentation
A new design document was added outlining the purpose and methodology for deterministic, hard fork-driven upgrades of L2 contracts, with both implementation and upgrade paths written in Solidity. This aims to improve the upgrade process for protocol developers. ([#351](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/351))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Deprecation of Kurtosis
The issue regarding `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` support for `sysext` was closed due to Kurtosis being deprecated. ([#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16704))

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Tracking Support for Embedded Custom Prestes in Kona
Discussion continues on adding support for embedded custom prestates to Kona. A fix is currently under review. ([#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18271))

### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Report Script
The `print_staging_report` script needs updating to be compatible with dispute-game v2. The script currently reads game arguments from the game implementation contract, which needs to be adapted to read from the `gameArgs` storage in the DGF if available. There are also concerns about the script's assumption of only permissioned and permissionless games, as there will be two permissionless games, and potential disruption from changes to the JSON output format.
