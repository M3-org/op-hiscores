## NEW ISSUES
### Risk Analysis and Documentation
A new issue was opened to conduct a Failure Modes Analysis for `min-base-fee`. This analysis is crucial for understanding potential risks and ensuring the robustness of the system. Alternative risk modeling is acceptable, and coordination with @mds1 is advised for the latest guidance. This work is linked to a previous pull request and an overarching tracking ticket.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Congestion-based Builder Transaction Reordering
Discussion continued on the issue concerning congestion-based builder transaction reordering. A new comment from `moonfury-ops` expressed interest in collaborating with `sebastianst` on this design document. The issue aims to explore tracking DA usage excess over time with an exponential cost/score penalty as a potential mechanism, which could be implemented outside the protocol to test the idea for an L1 congestion cost component.
