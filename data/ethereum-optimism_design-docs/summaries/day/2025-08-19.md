## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Missing Test Logs in `op-acceptance-tests`
Discussion continued on issue [#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17151) regarding missing test logs in `op-acceptance-tests`. The latest comment indicates that the workflow job ("go-tests-short") is not intended for acceptance tests, and while it contains some sysgo acceptance tests, they are not run via `op-acceptor`, which would capture logs into files. Work is in progress to move these tests, which is expected to resolve the issue.

### Outdated Content on Audit Page
A comment was added to issue [#1673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/1673), which is related to a 2024 Q4 audit and an outdated page. The comment requests clarification on which specific page is being referred to for updates.
