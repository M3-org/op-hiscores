## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on introducing a DA footprint block limit to mitigate spam and prevent priority fee auctions, enhancing the protocol's robustness.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Protocol Enhancements for Data Availability
A significant update introduced a DA footprint block limit to address data availability spam and prevent priority fee auctions. This mechanism tracks DA footprint alongside gas, dynamically adjusting the block gas limit based on estimated DA impact. This change is documented in new and updated protocol files.

### Flashblocks Enablement on Sunnyside Sequencers
The issue concerning the enablement of flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers ([#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16761)) has been resolved. The latest update confirms that flashblocks have been successfully enabled, with a reference to the corresponding pull request in the k8s repository. Previous updates indicated that both Sunnyside sequencers had `op-rbuilder` deployed and synced, with next steps including deploying `rollup-boosts` in disabled mode and a backup sequencer without flashblocks, followed by enabling `execution_mode` based on flashblocks health.
