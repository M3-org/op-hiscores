# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Aug 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on security documentation with the addition of a threat model report for MinBaseFee and ongoing discussions around its specification and state growth implications.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Security Documentation for MinBaseFee:** A comprehensive threat model report for the MinBaseFee feature was added, migrating content previously held in Notion. This includes detailed analysis and supporting images. ([#314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/314))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   A new pull request, [#315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/315), was opened to update the minimum base fee documentation to align with the latest implementation.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Congestion-Based Builder Transaction Reordering:** The issue discussing the design document for congestion-based builder transaction reordering was closed. ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/306))

## NEW ISSUES

*   **Min-Base-Fee State Growth Estimate:** A new issue, [#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/316), was created to add a state growth estimate to the MinBaseFee Feature Model Analysis (FMA). Initial napkin math suggests approximately 16MB of state growth per year due to an extra byte for `minBaseFeeLog2` per block.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **op-test-sequencer Integration:** Discussion on [#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15265) indicates that adding `op-test-sequencer` to the devnet environment and Kurtosis is required for running reorg tests in the `kona-supervisor` devstack environment. This issue was previously deprioritized but has been re-opened due to a pending todo in the code.
*   **Min-Base-Fee Specification:** On [#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/742), it was noted that the state growth estimate for MinBaseFee, initially considered for the specification, was decided to be better placed in the FMA, leading to the creation of a new issue ([#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/316)) to track this.
