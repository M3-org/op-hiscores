### Blob Priority Fee Tracking Discussion
Discussion continued on [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102) regarding blob priority fee tracking for `op-batcher/txmgr`. A new comment from ajsutton suggested a potential "quick win" to have the starting priority fee for new transactions "decay" from the previous transaction rather than always resetting to the minimum. This approach aims to improve batcher handling of backlogs during busy periods, acknowledging it might not be as comprehensive as other solutions but could be simpler to implement.
