### Blob Priority Fee Tracking Discussion
Discussion continued on [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102) regarding `op-batcher/txmgr: Blob priority fee tracking`. A new comment from ajsutton suggested a potential "quick win" to improve transaction inclusion by having the starting priority fee for new transactions "decay" from the previous transaction's fee, rather than always resetting to a minimum. This approach aims to help the batcher handle backlogs more effectively during busy periods, though it is noted as a less comprehensive solution compared to the original suggestion in the issue.
