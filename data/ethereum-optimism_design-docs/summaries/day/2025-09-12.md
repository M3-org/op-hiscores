# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Daily Update (Sep 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the opening of a new pull request for a Flash BAL design doc and the creation of two new bug reports. Several older issues related to testing, devnet spinup, and abnormal CPU usage were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No completed work was reported for this period.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/337), was opened to introduce a design document for Flash BAL.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Testing and Development Process Improvements
Several issues related to testing and development processes were closed. This includes the closure of [#188](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/188) concerning test retries, which was deemed no longer wanted. Additionally, [#198](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/198), which requested the return of test stdout & stderr, was closed as completed. The issue [#168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/168), focused on porting Isthmus withdrawals root Action Tests, was closed as Isthmus has already shipped. The issue [#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/346), regarding a script for permissionless devnet spinup, was closed as it has been implemented elsewhere or differently.

### Performance and Stability Issues
The issue [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/613), reporting abnormal CPU usage with op-geth v1.101511.0, was closed. The latest comment suggests the issue might have resolved itself after log indexing finished.

## NEW ISSUES

### Bug Reports
Two new bug reports were opened, both titled "รายงานจุดบกพร่อง" (Bug Report) and lacking specific details in their initial body: [#338](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/338) and [#339](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/339).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Receipt Correction: Failed to decode RLP receipts ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/679))
This issue, opened on September 12, 2025, reports a crash with "Failed to decode RLP receipts" when using op-geth v1.101602.0 on op-mainnet during full sync. The user `cpuchainorg` noted that the full log was unavailable due to Geth crashing and filling logs with "Receipt Correction" messages. `sebastianst` confirmed the team has experienced this issue during snap-syncing an op-mainnet node and is investigating, later suggesting a fix in a separate PR. `cpuchainorg` later commented that the issue seems fixed with the latest version patch.
