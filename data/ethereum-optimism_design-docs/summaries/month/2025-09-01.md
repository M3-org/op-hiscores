# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September was a period of foundational design and planning for significant protocol upgrades. A key achievement was the finalization of a design document for a critical fix in the OPCM Superchain upgrade, bolstering protocol security and interoperability. Extensive design discussions centered on the integration of the new Kona + Cannon fault-proof system, with detailed planning for necessary changes across contracts and monitoring tools. Additionally, new work began on refining the minimum base fee calculation, and ongoing efforts continued to improve developer experience and testing frameworks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on formalizing protocol designs and initiating new improvements.

- **Superchain Upgrade Design:** A critical design document for the OPCM Superchain upgrade fix was completed and merged ([#310](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/310)). This document addresses a key protocol issue, ensuring alignment with the future vision of the Superchain.
- **Fee Calculation Enhancements:** A new proposal was opened to update the minimum base fee calculation to account for database growth ([#333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/333)), signaling a focus on the long-term economic sustainability of the protocol.
- **Documentation:** A minor update to the repository's README was initiated ([#332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/332)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this month, but active discussions highlighted several key areas of focus for upcoming development.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Kona + Cannon Integration:** This was the most significant area of discussion. Multiple issues tracked the work required to support the new fault-proof system. Discussions confirmed that `OPContractsManager.sol` will need updates to deploy the new game type ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17285)), `op-dispute-mon` must be updated to recognize and support the new game type ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17286)), and a new `type = "cannon-kona"` will be needed for prestates integration ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17283)).
    - **Protocol Stability & Bugs:** A bug was identified where `ConfigureGossip` in `op-node` overwrites sane defaults with zero values, causing panics in tests ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17308)). Discussions are underway to determine the best approach for providing valid default configurations.
    - **Developer Experience & Testing:** A discussion on improving the CircleCI configuration aims to enhance the developer experience by making high-value CI jobs easier to run locally ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17184)). In parallel, an issue for enhancing the sync tester was reopened to ensure all Hardfork transitions are properly tested ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16703)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions across several critical issues. Team members like `ajsutton` and `pauldowman` were actively engaged in defining the requirements for the Kona + Cannon upgrade, ensuring a coordinated approach. The active debate in issues like the P2P gossip bug ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17308)) and CI improvements ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17184)) demonstrates a healthy, collaborative process for weighing different technical solutions to improve the protocol and developer tooling.
