# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July's efforts in the design-docs repository centered on enhancing the economic and operational robustness of the Optimism protocol. Significant new design work was initiated around core fee mechanisms, including proposals for revenue sharing and handling L1 congestion fees. These initiatives were complemented by active discussions on implementing a `min-base-fee`, analyzing its failure modes, and exploring congestion-based transaction reordering. On the operational front, detailed planning for improved flashblocks monitoring and alerting took place, while housekeeping efforts closed out numerous long-standing issues related to sequencer stability and node operation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no new features were completed or merged this month, significant progress was made in proposing and drafting new designs for core protocol mechanics.

- **Proposals for New Economic Mechanisms:** The primary focus of new work was on evolving the network's fee and revenue models.
    - A design proposal for **revenue sharing** was introduced in PR [#309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/309).
    - An initial draft for an **L1 congestion fee** design document was opened in PR [#312](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/312), aiming to address costs associated with L1 data availability.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month involved clearing out old tickets and opening new ones to track critical design and analysis work for upcoming protocol enhancements.

- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of older issues were closed, resolving past concerns and cleaning up the backlog.
    - **System Stability and Maintenance:** Several issues related to sequencer stability and recovery were closed as resolved or no longer relevant, including sequencer halting on temporary errors ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/12240)) and recovery from sequence window expiration ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/11228)). An issue regarding node startup ([#15411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15411)) and a request to update a deprecated NPM package ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/13459)) were also closed.
    - **Documentation and Testing:** A documentation clarification for the L2 testnet tutorial ([#1401](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/1401)) and a test porting task ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/413)) were resolved.

- **New & Active Issues:** Discussions and new issues centered on future fee structures and operational stability.
    - **Designing for Congestion and Fees:** This was the most active area of discussion. A new issue ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/306)) was opened to design **congestion-based builder transaction reordering**. The tracking issue for the **"Min Base Fee"** ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16807)) saw continued discussion, linking to in-flight implementation work in other repositories. A corresponding issue ([#311](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/311)) was created to conduct a formal Failure Modes Analysis for the `min-base-fee` feature.
    - **Improving Operational Monitoring:** A detailed discussion on **flashblocks monitoring and alerting** ([#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16388)) outlined specific metrics and thresholds for peer count, block progression, and pending transactions to ensure system health.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident across several key initiatives this month, both within the repository and across the broader Optimism ecosystem.

- Discussions on flashblocks monitoring ([#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16388)) were informed by a call between contributors `yashvardhan-kukreja` and `Jacob`.
- A new proposal for congestion-based transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/306)) saw contributor `moonfury-ops` express interest in collaborating on the design with `sebastianst`.
- The `min-base-fee` tracking issue highlighted significant cross-repository coordination, with links to active pull requests in the `reth`, `op-alloy`, and `optimism` repositories, demonstrating a concerted effort to implement the feature across the stack.
- Maintainer `mslipper` was active in triaging and closing a batch of older issues, contributing to the overall health of the project's issue tracker.
