# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of both concluding major initiatives and laying the architectural groundwork for future protocol enhancements. The team officially closed the book on the Isthmus Upgrade, marking the completion of a significant development cycle. Concurrently, new design work began on core components like the Kona Rollup Node and a native revenue-sharing mechanism. Efforts were also directed toward improving system resilience through detailed failure mode analysis and resolving operational issues with Flashblocks and dispute monitoring, reflecting a dual focus on finalizing past work and building a more robust foundation for the future.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on documenting new architecture, enhancing system security, and performing routine maintenance.

- **Protocol & Architectural Design:** Significant progress was made in formalizing the next generation of OP Stack components.
  - An initial design document for **revenue sharing** was introduced, outlining how a fee split predeploy will be enshrined in the protocol ([#309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/309)).
  - A new architecture document for the **Kona Rollup Node** (`kona-node`) was added, detailing its design and providing a comparison to the existing `op-node` with helpful diagrams ([#264](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/264)).

- **Security & Resilience Analysis:** The project continued to strengthen its security posture by documenting and analyzing potential failure modes.
  - The generic failure mode documentation for "Chain split driven by L1 chain split" was updated ([#347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/347)).
  - A new pull request was opened to add Failure Mode Analysis (FMA) for an operator fee fix ([#349](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/349)).

- **Documentation Maintenance:** Several updates were made to improve the quality and accuracy of the design documents.
  - Broken links were removed to improve user experience, including one pointing to the now-defunct Kona website ([#345](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/345), [#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/346)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on closing out completed work, addressing operational challenges, and identifying areas for future improvement.

- **Closed Issues:** Several key issues were resolved, marking the completion of significant workstreams.
  - **Isthmus Upgrade Concluded:** The main tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade was closed, formally marking the end of this major initiative ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/12703)).
  - **Flashblocks Integration Resolved:** Issues related to Flashblocks connectivity were resolved with upgrades to the `Flashblocks-websocket-proxy`, and coordination with RPC providers was successfully completed ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17856), [#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17857)).
  - **Protocol & Tooling Refinements:** Other closed issues included clarifying L2EL sync conditions ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17628)), updating DA footprint block limit specifications ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/792)), and enhancing acceptance test output ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/386)).

- **New & Active Issues:** Discussions this month highlighted important ongoing challenges and strategic shifts.
  - **Terminology Standardization:** A new issue was opened to address inconsistent use of "soft-fork" versus "hard-fork" terminology, aiming for greater precision in the documentation ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/342)).
  - **Cannon Compatibility Blocker:** A critical issue remains active regarding `cannon`'s incompatibility with Go 1.25, which causes incorrect Keccak hashes and affects block hash calculations. This is blocked by an upstream issue in the Go repository ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17060)).
  - **Dispute Monitoring Logic:** An important discussion is underway on how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes, with a proposal to use `syncStatus` to more reliably determine the current L2 head ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17814)).
  - **Development Strategy Shift:** The strategy for integrating `op-reth` has been updated; focus will shift to the `devstack / sysgo` system, as the previously used Kurtosis devnet is now deprecated ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17475)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. The ongoing conversation around `cannon` compatibility with Go 1.25 ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17060)) and the handling of out-of-sync nodes in `op-dispute-mon` ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17814)) showcases deep engagement from core contributors in solving complex technical challenges. Furthermore, the resolution of Flashblocks issues ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17857)) points to successful coordination with external RPC providers. The strategic pivot on `op-reth` integration also demonstrates the team's ability to adapt its development roadmap in response to evolving tooling.
