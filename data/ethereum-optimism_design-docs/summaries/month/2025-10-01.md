# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's activity centered on finalizing major initiatives and addressing foundational challenges. The most significant achievement was the formal conclusion of the Isthmus Upgrade, marking the completion of a key protocol enhancement. While no new features were merged, progress was made through strategic discussions on tooling compatibility and integration. Ongoing work highlights a critical blocker with Go 1.25 affecting Cannon's hashing functions and a pivot in the integration strategy for `op-reth`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While the provided reports did not include newly merged pull requests, several important workstreams were concluded, as evidenced by the closure of their tracking issues.

- **Isthmus Upgrade Finalized:** The tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade was closed, formally marking the end of this significant development cycle and signifying that the upgrade is complete and stable. ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/12703))
- **Acceptance Test Enhancements:** Work was completed to improve the diagnostic output of `op-acceptor` tests. The HTML output now includes setup information, providing better context for test analysis and debugging. ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/386))
- **Protocol Clarity:** An investigation into the L2EL sync conditions was resolved, clarifying that the `engineController.insertUnsafePayload` function likely handles the observed behavior. This resolution enhances the collective understanding of the EL synchronization process. ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17628))

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on closing out completed work, identifying documentation inconsistencies, and tackling significant technical blockers.

- **Closed Issues:** Key problems resolved include the official completion of the Isthmus Upgrade, clarification on L2EL sync conditions, and an enhancement to acceptance test reporting. These closures represent the finalization of important protocol and tooling initiatives.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Terminology Standardization:** A new issue was opened to standardize the use of "soft-fork" versus "hard-fork" terminology across the design documents, aiming for greater precision and clarity. ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/342))
    - **Go Compatibility Blocker:** A critical discussion is ongoing regarding Cannon's incompatibility with Go 1.25. This version causes all Keccak hashes to be calculated incorrectly, impacting block hash integrity. The issue is currently blocked by an upstream issue in the Go repository. ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17060))
    - **Integration Strategy Pivot:** The plan for integrating `op-reth` is shifting. Following the deprecation of the Kurtosis devnet, the new focus is on integrating `op-reth` into the `devstack / sysgo` system. ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17475))

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was centered on resolving complex technical issues and refining project strategy. Discussions on active issues showed focused engagement from team members. For instance, `@pauldowman` and `@ajsutton` collaborated to diagnose the Go 1.25 compatibility problem in Cannon, while `@geoknee` provided clear direction on the new integration path for `op-reth`. The activity reflects a mature project phase, with an emphasis on stability, long-term maintenance, and strategic planning over rapid feature development.
