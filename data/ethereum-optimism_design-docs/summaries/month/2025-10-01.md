# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of significant progress in both finalizing major initiatives and laying the groundwork for future protocol enhancements. The formal conclusion of the Isthmus Upgrade marked a key milestone for the project. Development focus shifted heavily toward architectural documentation, with new design documents for the Kona Rollup Node and a revenue-sharing mechanism. Concurrently, the team successfully resolved integration challenges with Flashblocks and continued to refine security analysis, all while navigating ongoing technical discussions around tooling compatibility and monitoring strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on expanding and refining the core design documentation of the OP Stack.

- **Protocol Design & Architecture:** New documentation was introduced to formalize key components of the stack. An architecture document for the `kona-node` (Kona Rollup Node) was added, providing a detailed comparison to the `op-node` with helpful diagrams ([#264](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/264)). An initial design for a revenue-sharing mechanism was also proposed, outlining how the fee split predeploy will be enshrined in the protocol ([#309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/309)).

- **Security and Failure Mode Analysis (FMA):** The project's resilience was strengthened through documentation updates. The generic failure mode analysis for L1 chain splits was updated ([#347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/347)), and a new FMA was added for an operator fee fix ([#349](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/349)).

- **Documentation Maintenance:** Efforts were made to improve the quality and usability of the existing documentation. Dead links were removed to prevent 404 errors and improve the reader experience ([#345](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/345), [#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/346)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on closing out completed work, resolving integration issues, and identifying key technical challenges for future development.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Isthmus Upgrade Complete:** The tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade was officially closed, marking the successful completion of this major network initiative ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/12703)).
    - **Flashblocks Integration:** Issues related to Flashblocks connectivity were resolved. A fix to the `Flashblocks-websocket-proxy` addressed lost connections ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17856)), and coordination with RPC providers for the new Flashblocks node was successfully completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17857)).
    - **Technical Cleanup:** Several issues were closed, reflecting completed work and a clearer understanding of system components. This includes clarifying L2EL sync conditions ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17628)), enhancing `op-acceptor` test outputs ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/386)), and updating DA footprint block limit specifications ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/792)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Terminology Standardization:** A new issue was opened to standardize the use of "soft-fork" versus "hard-fork" terminology throughout the documentation, aiming for greater precision ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/342)).
    - **Cannon/Go Compatibility:** A significant ongoing discussion revolves around Cannon's incompatibility with Go 1.25, which causes incorrect Keccak hashes and impacts block hash calculations. This is being tracked as a blocker with dependencies on the upstream Go project ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17060)).
    - **Monitoring & Testing Strategy:** Active discussions are underway to refine how `op-dispute-mon` handles out-of-sync nodes, with a proposal to use `syncStatus` for more reliable fork detection ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17814)). Additionally, the integration strategy for `op-reth` is shifting from the deprecated Kurtosis devnet to the `devstack / sysgo` system ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17475)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in tackling complex technical challenges and coordinating with ecosystem partners. The active discussion on the Cannon/Go 1.25 compatibility issue ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17060)) and the `op-dispute-mon` sync logic ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17814)) demonstrates a collaborative approach to problem-solving among core contributors. Furthermore, the successful resolution of the Flashblocks RPC coordination issue ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17857)) highlights effective communication with external RPC providers and partners like Blockscout, which is crucial for the health of the broader ecosystem.
