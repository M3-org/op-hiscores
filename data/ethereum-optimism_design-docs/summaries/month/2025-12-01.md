# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December's activity centered on critical issue investigation and foundational design refinement. A significant node synchronization issue affecting multiple chains across the Superchain ecosystem emerged, prompting immediate and active triage from the community and maintainers. Concurrently, forward-looking design work continued with a new proposal to simplify the Kona node actor architecture. Community engagement was also a key theme, with contributors actively participating in issue diagnosis and volunteering to take on new development tasks.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
While no major features were completed, progress was made on architectural design proposals.

- **Kona Architecture Refinement**
  - A pull request ([#358](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/358)) was opened to simplify the Kona node actor design. This proposal aims to refine the underlying architecture for future development.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management was a primary focus, with a critical new bug report and ongoing discussion on existing needs.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - No issues were reported as closed during this period.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Node Synchronization Failures:** A high-priority issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18581)) was opened concerning node synchronization failures. Users across Base, Optimism, and Unichain reported errors like "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload," potentially linked to L1 Execution Client data provision or issues with public snapshots. The issue is under active investigation, with maintainers requesting detailed client configurations and logs to diagnose the root cause.
  - **Replica Healthcheck for op-rbuilder:** Discussion continued on issue [#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17685), which proposes a dedicated healthcheck for `op-rbuilder`. The conversation saw a community member express interest in implementing the feature.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the rapid response to new problems and proactive engagement on development tasks. The node synchronization issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18581)) quickly gathered reports from multiple users and a detailed diagnostic request from a maintainer, showcasing a responsive feedback loop. Additionally, a community member's interest in taking on the `op-rbuilder` healthcheck issue ([#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17685)) highlights healthy contributor participation in the project.
