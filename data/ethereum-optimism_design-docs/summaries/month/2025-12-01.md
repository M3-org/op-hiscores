# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December's focus was squarely on node stability and architectural refinement. A significant node synchronization issue emerged, impacting users across multiple chains and prompting an active investigation into state syncing failures between L1 and L2 clients. In parallel, design work continued with a new proposal to simplify the Kona node actor architecture, indicating ongoing efforts to improve the core protocol. Community engagement was also notable, with contributors stepping up to address reliability and monitoring needs.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Activity this month centered on architectural design rather than feature implementation.

- **Kona Node Architecture**
  - A new pull request ([#358](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/358)) was opened with the goal of simplifying the Kona node actor design. This proposal represents an ongoing effort to refine and streamline the underlying architecture of network components.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The primary focus of issue tracking this month was a critical node synchronization problem.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - No issues were reported as closed during this period.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Node Synchronization Failures:** A major issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18581)) was reported concerning widespread node synchronization problems. Users on Base, Optimism, and Unichain experienced "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors, suggesting a failure in the L1 Execution Client providing necessary state data to the Op-Node. The issue is under active investigation, with maintainers requesting detailed logs and client configurations to diagnose the root cause.
  - **Builder Health Monitoring:** Discussion continued on issue [#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17685), which proposes a dedicated replica-healthcheck for `op-rbuilder`. This is aimed at ensuring the builder does not diverge from `op-geth`, and a community member has expressed interest in taking on the task.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both troubleshooting and proactive development efforts. The detailed user reports and shared experiences in the node synchronization issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18581)) were crucial in defining the scope of the problem for maintainers. Additionally, a community member's offer to implement the `op-rbuilder` healthcheck ([#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17685)) highlights positive engagement and a willingness from the community to contribute to the project's core reliability.
