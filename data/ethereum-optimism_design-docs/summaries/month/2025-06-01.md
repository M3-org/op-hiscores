# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
Activity in June concluded with a focus on future enhancements and rapid issue resolution. A significant new design document was proposed for configurable calldata gas, indicating ongoing work to refine the economic model of the protocol. Additionally, the project demonstrated efficient issue triage with the swift closure of a reported bug concerning the `op-deployer` tool.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, no design documents were completed or merged during this period. However, new work was initiated that points to future protocol improvements.

A new pull request ([#294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/294)) was opened to introduce a design for configurable calldata gas. This proposal is currently awaiting review and represents a key area of active design consideration.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was prompt, with one key problem being resolved.

- **Closed Issues:** A bug related to `op-deployer v0.4.0-rc.2` ([#16618](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16618)) was reported and closed on the same day. The issue, which caused an error when using `standard-overrides`, was fixed in a subsequent release candidate.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no significant discussions on existing active issues during this timeframe.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The available data highlights efficient internal processes, as seen in the quick resolution of the `op-deployer` issue. The introduction of the configurable calldata gas design document suggests ongoing architectural discussions, though the reports do not provide details on broader community engagement or collaborative reviews for this period.
