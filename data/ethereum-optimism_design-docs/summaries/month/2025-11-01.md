# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
November's activity centered on strategic discussions for improving the OP Stack's transaction submission process. The primary focus was on optimizing the `op-batcher`'s handling of blob priority fees to ensure more reliable transaction inclusion, especially during periods of high network congestion. While no new code was merged, a key proposal emerged for a more dynamic fee adjustment mechanism, signaling a focus on enhancing the robustness of core infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, no new features, bug fixes, or other technical developments were completed and merged this month.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month was focused on discussion rather than resolution or new reports. No issues were opened or closed.

- **New & Active Issues:** The central point of discussion was issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102), concerning blob priority fee tracking in the `op-batcher/txmgr`. A notable proposal was made to implement a "quick win" where the starting priority fee for a new transaction would "decay" from the previous transaction's fee instead of resetting to a minimum. This approach aims to help the batcher more effectively process backlogs during busy periods.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was demonstrated through focused technical discussion on a key performance challenge. The conversation on issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102) highlighted community engagement, with contributor `ajsutton` providing a specific, actionable suggestion to improve the batcher's fee management strategy. This reflects a collaborative effort to refine core components of the OP Stack.
