# ethereum-optimism/design-docs Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
August was a month of significant progress in maturing core protocol features and introducing new design proposals for future capabilities. The specification for the `min-base-fee` feature reached a major milestone with the completion of its threat model, state growth analysis, and final documentation, leading to the closure of several long-standing issues. Alongside this, the team introduced forward-looking designs for Custom Gas Tokens, a Reactive Security Council, and nonceless execution. Efforts also continued to bolster the Superchain's operational robustness through enhancements in testing, deployment tooling, and monitoring for features like Flashblocks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on solidifying existing protocol mechanics while laying the groundwork for new architectural enhancements.

### Protocol Fee and State Management
Significant effort was dedicated to refining the `min-base-fee` feature and other fee-related mechanisms.
- **Operator Fee Formula:** The `operatorFee` calculation was refined with a scalar fix to improve its precision ([#299](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/299)).
- **MinBaseFee Security & Documentation:** A comprehensive threat model for MinBaseFee was formally documented ([#314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/314)), and its documentation was updated to include refined database growth estimates ([#319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/319), [#321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/321)).

### New Protocol Design Proposals
Several new design documents were introduced, outlining potential new features for the OP Stack.
- **Custom Gas Tokens (CGT):** A new, minimal, and flexible design for CGT support was introduced, replacing previous experimental approaches ([#305](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/305)). A related PR for migrating custom gas tokens was also opened ([#313](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/313)).
- **Security and Governance:** Proposals were introduced for a `TimelockGuard` ([#324](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/324)), a Single-Approval Long-Delay TimelockGuard ([#326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/326)), a Reactive Security Council ([#327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/327)), and a fee splitter ([#328](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/328)).
- **Protocol Enhancements:** Designs were proposed for a new liveness module ([#320](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/320)), nonceless execution ([#322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/322)), and a data availability footprint block limit ([#317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/317)).

### Documentation and Tooling Improvements
Documentation was a key focus, aimed at improving clarity for developers and operators.
- **Deployment Tooling:** A design document was added for `op-deployer` detailing the use of Forge ([#325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/325)).
- **Protocol Design Guidance:** New guidance was added for naming activation checks in decoupled features ([#318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/318)), and the design for dispute game creators was clarified ([#331](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/331)).
- **Liquidity Controller:** The `LiquidityController` documentation was updated to include the new `deauthorizeMinter` function ([#329](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/329)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month reflected a push to finalize in-flight features and improve the stability of the developer toolchain.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **`min-base-fee` Finalization:** A cluster of issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature were closed, including the failure modes analysis ([#311](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/311)), state growth estimation ([#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/316)), and the main specification tracking issue ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/742)), signaling the feature's maturity.
    - **Testing and Tooling:** Several issues were resolved, confirming the completion of `op-challenger` acceptance tests ([#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/15948)), the successful implementation of flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16688)), and the cleanup of the event system ([#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/17001), [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16874)).
    - **Governance:** An issue regarding an inappropriately flagged project in Retro-Funding was investigated and resolved ([#72](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/72)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **P2P Sync Deprecation:** A significant discussion emerged around deprecating the req-resp p2p sync ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/14108)), with a detailed alternative proposal for a simpler, faster unsafe block sync mechanism using a centralized driver and Redis.
    - **Flashblocks Operations:** Multiple active issues focus on the operational readiness of Flashblocks, including load testing ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16756)), monitoring and alerting ([#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16388), [#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16867)), and peer health ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/16868)).
    - **Tooling Stability:** The `op-proposer` transaction failure issue ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/13502)) saw a potential resolution shared by a community member, highlighting the importance of correct game type configuration.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions on complex architectural changes. The conversation around deprecating the req-resp p2p sync ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/14108)) showcased deep collaboration, with team members relaying and building upon detailed proposals from others. Similarly, the resolution of the `op-proposer` failure issue ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/13502)) demonstrated effective community-driven troubleshooting. The iterative refinement of the `min-base-fee` specifications involved multiple contributors across several issues and pull requests, reflecting a coordinated effort to solidify a core protocol feature.
