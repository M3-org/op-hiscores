## NEW ISSUES
### Gas Testing Determinism
A new feature request, [#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/408), was opened to enable deterministic gas testing by setting a fixed base fee. This aims to address difficulties in creating predictable tests for cross-chain contracts involving gas cost estimation due to fluctuating base fees.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Deterministic Gas Testing
Discussion on [#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/408) revolved around the effectiveness of the `--base-fee` flag in Anvil for achieving deterministic base fees. `tremarkley` questioned if setting the flag would ensure a constant `block.basefee` across blocks, noting that vanilla Anvil's base fee still fluctuates after the initial block. `hexshire` clarified a misunderstanding of the `--base-fee` functionality, suggesting adapting tests to query the `baseFee` instead and considering closing the issue. `tremarkley` then closed the issue, inviting reopening if the flag proves useful.
