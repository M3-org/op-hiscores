# ethereum-optimism/supersim Daily Update (Jul 10, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on integrating the latest `GasTank` updates into the `supersim` repository, impacting several genesis files. A long-standing issue regarding interop prestate configuration was also closed, with the team concluding that tooling mitigations have addressed the underlying risk.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### GasTank Integration
The `GasTank` component was updated to its latest commit, reflecting improvements in the `interop-lib`. This update involved changes across multiple genesis files, ensuring compatibility and incorporating the newest features. ([#414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/414))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interop Prestate Configuration
Issue [#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/15765), which concerned checking the EL prestate for pre-interop `CrossL2Inbox` configuration faults, was closed. The team determined that the risk has been sufficiently mitigated by improvements in the genesis generation tooling, making client-side validation less critical.

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Interop: check EL prestate for pre-interop CrossL2Inbox configuration fault ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/15765))
This issue, created on May 7, 2025, was closed today. The discussion revolved around the necessity of the execution client validating the presence of `CrossL2Inbox` in the L2 genesis state for chains not actively using interop at genesis. The latest comment from ajsutton (Jul 10, 2025) concluded that the execution client is not ideally positioned for this validation due to dependency and world state availability challenges. Furthermore, the `op-deployer` tool now automatically handles the inclusion of `CrossL2Inbox` based on the number of chains and interop activation, significantly reducing the risk of incorrect genesis generation. Therefore, the issue was closed as the problem has been addressed through tooling improvements rather than client-side checks.
