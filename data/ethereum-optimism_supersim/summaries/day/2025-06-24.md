# ethereum-optimism/supersim Daily Update (Jun 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant activity in issue management, with several issues related to CI/testing improvements and developer tooling being closed. A new feature request for enhanced logging was also opened.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No new features were added, bugs fixed, code refactored, documentation enhanced, or tests added on this day.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### CI/Testing Infrastructure Improvements
Several issues related to improving the continuous integration and testing infrastructure were closed. This includes an investigation into and improvement of CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16271)) and a spike exploring CI SLAs ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16437)). The CI SLA spike concluded that SLAs will not be implemented for now.

### Developer Tooling and Simulation Enhancements
Two feature requests aimed at enhancing developer tooling and simulation capabilities were closed. This includes the request to include Uniswap v4 deployment in supersim ([#409](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/409)) and enabling deterministic gas testing by setting a fixed base fee ([#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/408)). The deterministic gas testing issue was closed as the `--base-fee` flag in Anvil does not maintain a fixed base fee across blocks as initially expected.

### Documentation Updates
A documentation-related issue concerning bridging ERC-20 tokens with Viem was closed ([#1508](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/1508)), indicating that the relevant updates have been completed.

### Acceptance Test Porting
An issue to port the `TestWithdrawalsRoot` acceptance test to devstack was closed ([#412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/412)), with the implementation noted in a related PR.

## NEW ISSUES

### Enhanced Logging for Contract Interactions
A new feature request was opened to enable user-specified contract logging within supersim ([#411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/411)). This would allow users to specify contracts for which they would like events to be logged, improving debugging and analysis capabilities.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Investigation into op-node Goroutine Stalls
Issue [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16332) continues to track a bug where `op-node` (v1.13.3) experiences thousands of stuck goroutines, primarily in `select`, `IO wait`, or `yamux` session handlers, leading to sync failures. Recent comments from `rrrengineer` and `Creamers158` confirm that this issue is still present for them on `op-node` v1.13.3, with `rrrengineer` noting they haven't tried v1.13.4 yet. The detailed stack traces provided by `Creamers158` highlight the `libp2p` and `multiformats` components as potential areas of concern.
