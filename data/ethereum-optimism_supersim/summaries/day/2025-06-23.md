# ethereum-optimism/supersim Daily Update (Jun 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw no new code contributions, but significant discussion on active issues, particularly around optimizing `op-batcher` memory consumption and refining `op-node` interop modes. Two new issues were opened, one concerning Uniswap V4 deployment and another addressing chain ID data types.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Core Protocol Enhancements
A new issue, [#410](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/410), was opened to address a technical inconsistency where dependency set chain IDs are currently cast as `uint64` in Supersim, which is not compliant with the `uint256` specification.
### Ecosystem Integration
Another new issue, [#409](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/409), was created to include Uniswap V4 deployment within Supersim, indicating a focus on expanding the simulated environment's capabilities.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-batcher` Memory Optimization
Discussion on [#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16537) (spike(op-batcher): optimize memory consumption) continued with `geoknee` providing a detailed recipe for using `pprof` to identify memory bottlenecks. Initial findings suggest the compressor is the primary source of memory usage when a backlog of channels occurs. `geoknee` proposed two optimizations: making the shadow compressor use half the memory and more eagerly discarding the compressor after channel submission. `sebastianst` suggested exploring the use of a single, shared compressor to further save memory.

### `op-node` Trivial Interop Mode
On [#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16519) (op-node: Trivial-interop mode without supervisor), `sebastianst` clarified that allowing trivial interop without a supervisor aims to prevent churn for chain operators who only have a trivial dependency set, especially in the coming months before interop merging is fully implemented. This approach allows them to start running a supervisor weeks before an actual merge, simplifying future transitions.

### Redundant Assertion Removal
Regarding [#16362](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16362) (Remove redundant assertions outside of the StandardValidator), `AmadiMichael` outlined a two-phase approach for refactoring. The first phase involves removing checks from `Deploy*.s.sol` scripts that are already present in `ChainAssertions.sol`. The second phase will move checks from `ChainAssertions.sol` to the `StandardValidator`, with a plan to use a child contract if codesize limits are exceeded.
