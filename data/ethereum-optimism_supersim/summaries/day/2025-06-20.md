## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Release Pipeline Automation and Changelog Generation
Discussions continued on automating the release pipeline for `op-node`, `batcher`, `proposer`, and `challenger` using GoReleaser [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16097). The latest comments from `geoknee` on June 20th and 26th emphasize the desire for a one-click solution for high-quality, accurate, and consistent changelogs, potentially integrated into `op-workbench`. A lighter-weight solution for changelog generation using `git cliff` was also documented. Earlier comments from `protolambda` highlighted concerns about adding another build system (GoReleaser) without first consolidating existing, fragmented build processes (docker bake, makefiles, justfiles) to avoid further bloat and inconsistency.

### Trivial-Interop Mode for op-node
Discussion on the `op-node`'s ability to operate in a trivial-interop mode without a supervisor continued [#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16519). `Inphi` questioned the necessity of this, suggesting it might complicate future merges into an existing interop cluster if chains aren't already supervisor-driven. `sebastianst` clarified that the primary goal is to prevent churn for chain operators by not requiring a supervisor for trivial depsets in the coming months, acknowledging that a better overall `op-supervisor` + `op-node` implementation will be needed by the time interop merging is fully implemented.
