# ethereum-optimism/supersim Daily Update (Jun 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on updating the GasTank to its latest version, impacting several genesis files. Significant progress was also made in closing multiple long-standing issues related to CI/CD improvements, task simulation, and documentation within the `superchain-ops` context.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Core Protocol Updates**: The `GasTank` component was updated to its latest version, affecting several L1 and L2 genesis configuration files. This ensures the simulation environment aligns with the most recent protocol specifications. ([#412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/412))

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **CI/CD and Task Automation Enhancements**: Several issues related to continuous integration, task automation, and simulation processes were closed. This includes improvements for automatically running tasks in CI ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/337)), supporting "stacked" proposals with incrementing nonces ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/342)), refining `SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER` behavior ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/448)), and optimizing CI job performance ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/648)). Additionally, the issue concerning state override nonce additions was resolved ([#814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/814)).
*   **Documentation and Developer Experience Improvements**: Efforts to enhance documentation and developer tooling were completed. This involved updating paths in improvement documentation ([#548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/548)), updating task paths for mainnet tasks ([#600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/600)), and providing a quick way to read addresses for chains not yet in the superchain registry ([#923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/923)). Training calls for the new `superchain-ops` tooling were also completed ([#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/514)).
*   **Multisig and Contract Interaction Refinements**: Issues related to multisig task architecture and contract interactions were addressed. This includes revisiting the `MultisigTask` architecture ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/636)), updating tests to use `contracts-bedrock` safe-tools and `stdStorage` library ([#605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/605)), and ensuring prevalidations are not hindered by address registry availability ([#654](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/654)). Improvements were also made to ensure templates check against `StandardValidator` contracts ([#838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/838)).
*   **Task Management and Validation**: Several tasks related to the management and validation of operational tasks were closed. This includes improvements to the OPCM Migrate Script ([#16326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16326)), updating `Fetch-Task` to use the Mainnet Task Directory ([#547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/547)), creating a mainnet example for the OPCM template ([#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/651)), and checking domain hash from simulation against `VALIDATIONS.md` ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/679)). A test for Sepolia task to transfer owner of ProtocolVersions was also completed ([#554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/554)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Abnormal CPU usage with latest op-geth ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/613))**: Discussion continues regarding high CPU usage in `op-geth` v1.101511.0. The latest comments suggest the issue might be temporary due to index updates, with `jsvisa` requesting `pprof` data for further analysis and `cpuchainorg` confirming the issue persists even after index upgrades, suspecting a broken goroutine. `PierrickGT` also reported the same issue and provided a `profile.pb.gz` file, noting the issue was due to index updates taking about 24 hours.
*   **Use GoReleaser for op-node/batcher/proposer/challenger release pipeline ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16097))**: The conversation revolves around automating release notes and the overall release pipeline. `geoknee` proposed wiring up `op-workbench` to automatically generate and push release notes using `git cliff`, emphasizing the desire for a one-click solution for consistent, high-quality changelogs.
*   **Refactor signFromChildMultisig to reduce noisy terminal output ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/781))**: Community members `JoseValperga`, `nsancheznez`, `Mau1401`, and `TheOnma` have expressed interest in working on this issue. `Cass402` identified the `print` function call within `simulateRun` as the primary source of noisy output and proposed removing or commenting it out, seeking feedback on whether this meets expectations or if a more selective reduction is preferred.
