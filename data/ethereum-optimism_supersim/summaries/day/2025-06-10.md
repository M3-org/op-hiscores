## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Addressing op-supervisor Event Overflow
Discussions continued on [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16335) regarding the op-supervisor's susceptibility to non-recoverable crash-loops due to event overflow when the unsafe head gap grows too large. @axelKingsley clarified that `ChainIndexingContinueEvent`s do not stack up, but are responses to previous `ChainProcess` events, and that there should be a 1:1 emit:consume ratio for indexing events. They noted that their previous fix for queue-depth issues might not have fully resolved all event system problems. @nonsense is working on adding a counter per event type to better debug future occurrences and is reviewing code paths, while also considering refactoring to remove `ChainIndexingContinueEvents`. @sebastianst initially suggested `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` as the culprit but later agreed that `"cross-unsafe-update"` events might be stacking up.

### Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes
Discussion on [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/15789) focused on understanding and supporting OPCM changes for the Fault Proof creator contract. @stevennevins provided an update on July 9, 2025, outlining a comprehensive list of tasks including moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, removing `anchorStateRegistry` from `StandardValidatorOverrides`, unskipping and updating tests in `DeployOPChain.t.sol`, reviewing comment responses, addressing TODOs, rebasing updates from EVM safety, and fixing Go updates in the Go test/integration. On June 10, 2025, @stevennevins linked to a related pull request: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16340.
