# ethereum-optimism/supersim Daily Update (Jun 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating core dependencies, closing several long-standing issues related to predeploy modifications and flashblocks support, and initiating discussions on memory optimization for the op-batcher.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dependency Updates
- Updated `GasTank` to its latest version, aligning with the `interop-lib` changes. This involved modifications across several genesis files and the `supersim.go` file to ensure compatibility and leverage the newest `GasTank` features ([#406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/406)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Predeploy Modification and Interoperability Testing
- The issue of enabling users to modify predeploys for testing was closed, as recent merges have addressed the ability to modify the `L2toL2CDM` predeploy. Future predeploy modification needs will be tracked in separate issues ([#393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/393)).
- Support for ERC-7683 was closed, indicating that the strategic discussion and potential integration for interop within Supersim have concluded ([#81](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/81)).

### Flashblocks Integration and Acceptance Testing
- The acceptance testing for flashblocks transactions was completed and closed, with the work being backed by several PRs that implemented transfer and streaming tests ([#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/354)).
- The task to enable flashblocks on `eris-0` was completed, involving multiple phases of PRs across `optimism-charts`, `devnets`, and `k8s` repositories to integrate flashblocks into a non-interop environment ([#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16468)).

### CI/CD and Documentation Improvements
- The spike exploring CI SLAs was closed, with the decision not to implement CI SLAs for now, but to consider smarter ways to allow new tests into the repository ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16437)).
- A broken link in the documentation for `L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol` was resolved and the issue closed ([#283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/283)).

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-batcher` Memory Optimization and Observability
- Discussions continued on spiking `op-batcher` memory consumption ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16537)). The latest comments suggest using `pprof` to identify memory usage, with findings indicating the compressor as a major consumer. Potential optimizations include using a single compressor and more eagerly discarding the compressor after channel submission.
- A new issue was opened to increase observability of `op-batcher` memory consumption ([#16572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16572)). The discussion highlights the need for `pprof` as a first-class citizen in `kurtosis-devnet` and CI tests to measure memory consumption. Existing benchmarks for channel compressors are noted, with a focus on ensuring they run locally, on CI, and are up-to-date with Brotli compression.

### Superchain Withdrawal Pathways
- The issue concerning withdrawal pathways for superchain output roots ([#821](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/821)) saw a comment inquiring about testing against upcoming devnets and endpoint availability, indicating ongoing work to adapt withdrawal code for the Superchain.

### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet Clarification
- A user inquired about the difference between Supersim and the interop Kurtosis devnet ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/399)). The latest response clarified that Supersim is a lighter wrapper around Anvil, primarily used for testing multichain/interop applications and upcoming features, while Kurtosis is used for testing the chains themselves.

### Feature Request: User-Specified Contract Logging
- A new feature request was opened to enable logging of user-specified contracts within Supersim ([#411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/411)). This would allow users to specify contracts for which they want event logs, improving debugging and testing capabilities.
