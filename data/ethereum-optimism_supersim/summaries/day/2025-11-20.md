# ethereum-optimism/supersim Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's activity focused on dependency updates and discussions around dispute game architecture. A critical issue regarding low batcher throughput was closed with a new runbook.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dependency Updates
A routine dependency update was initiated to bump the `golang.org/x/crypto` library to a newer version, ensuring the project benefits from the latest security patches and improvements.
* Bumped `golang.org/x/crypto` from 0.35.0 to 0.45.0 ([#419](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/419))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#419](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/419), was opened to update the `golang.org/x/crypto` dependency from version 0.35.0 to 0.45.0. This is a chore-related update.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Batcher Throughput Runbook
An issue concerning low batcher throughput and the `MinBaseFee` was addressed and closed. A runbook has been created to guide responses to potential issues where the `MinBaseFee` is set too high, leading to transactions not being included.
* Runbook for low batcher throughput created ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16959))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency in Dispute Games
Discussions are ongoing regarding the dependency of `IFaultDisputeGame` on `AnchorStateRegistry` and the implications of removing this dependency. The core of the discussion revolves around the necessity and implementation of a sanity check that ensures the `anchorStateRegistry()` from the dispute game matches the `AnchorStateRegistry` itself. While some argue for expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface to include an `AnchorStateRegistry` method for this sanity check, others question the necessity of this specific check given existing deployment-time validations and the recent addition of `wasRespectedAtGameCreation` which already ties dispute game implementations to the anchor state registry.
