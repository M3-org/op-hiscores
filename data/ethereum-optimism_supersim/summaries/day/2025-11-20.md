## OVERVIEW 
Today's activity in supersim included a dependency bump and the closure of an issue related to a runbook for low batcher throughput. A new issue was opened concerning the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency in `AnchorStateRegistry`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#419](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/419), was opened to update the `golang.org/x/crypto` dependency from version 0.35.0 to 0.45.0.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Batcher Throughput Runbook Completed
Issue [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16959), which aimed to create a runbook for low batcher throughput, has been closed. A runbook was created to address alerts related to low `op-batcher` pending block bytes.

## NEW ISSUES

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency Review
A new issue, [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18347), was opened to discuss removing the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry`. The current implementation checks if the `anchorStateRegistry()` from the dispute game matches the `AnchorStateRegistry` itself, which may not work for all game types.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency Discussion ([#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18347))
Discussion is ongoing regarding the necessity and implementation of the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency in `AnchorStateRegistry`. The core of the discussion revolves around whether the sanity check for the same `asr` is truly effective and if expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface to require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method would be a better approach. There's also a point about deployment time checks already ensuring the correct `ASR` is used.
