## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Code Style and Semgrep Rules
Discussion on [#15115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/15115) (Add semgrep rule for private/internal functions) indicates an attempt to enforce a new semgrep rule requiring private/internal functions to start with an underscore and public functions to not. The latest comment from `copilot-swe-agent` at 2025-07-23T20:43:48Z reports an error due to GitHub Actions being disabled for the repository, preventing progress on the issue.

### Test Target Setup and Teardown
Issue [#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/375) (Incorporate test target setup / teardown as an op-acceptor concern) discusses improving compatibility of acceptance tests across different test target networks. The latest comment from `scharissis` at 2025-07-23T08:07:21Z links to related pull requests in the `optimism` and `infra` repositories, suggesting ongoing work or considerations for this integration.
