# ethereum-optimism/supersim Daily Update (Sep 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant progress in flashblocks deployment and stability, with multiple related issues closed. Documentation for bridging ETH was updated, and several proof-related smoke tests were deemed no longer required.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, tests added, or other work were completed today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A dependency update was initiated to bump `vite` from version 5.4.9 to 5.4.20 in the `/examples/tictactoe` directory ([#416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/416)).

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Flashblocks Deployment and Monitoring
Several issues related to the deployment and monitoring of flashblocks on mainnet sequencers were closed. This includes enabling flashblocks on the initial `prod-mainnet-op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-0` ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16759)) and subsequently on the remaining sequencers on OP Labs infra ([#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16760)). Additionally, flashblocks were enabled on `op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-1` ([#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17317)). Alerts for low peer count health of flashblocks-enabled sequencers were also addressed and solved ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16868)).
### Sequencer Health and Upgrades
An issue concerning alerts for unhealthy non-flashblocks enabled sequencers was closed, confirming that existing alerts cover these cases ([#17143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17143)). The release and deployment of `op-conductor` with EL p2p healthchecks was completed and confirmed to be working ([#17153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17153)). An issue regarding upgrading `rbuilder` and `node-reth` for a chain stall fix was closed as it was deemed a non-blocker for L2 ([#17328](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17328)).
### Documentation and Testing Updates
A documentation suggestion to add an example for custom chains in the "Bridging ETH to OP Mainnet with Viem-Supported Networks" guide was updated and closed ([#1473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/1473)). Several proof-related smoke tests, including those for `op-challenger` ([#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/141)), general proofs ([#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/140)), `op-dispute-mon` ([#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/142)), and `op-proposer` ([#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/143)), were closed as they are no longer required.
### Kurtosis Reverse Proxy
An issue to implement Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy was closed as it will not be implemented, with a request to remove a related TODO in the code ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17194)).

## NEW ISSUES
### Op-Program Enhancements
A new issue was opened to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program` specifications ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17416)).
### Contract Upgrade Testing
An issue was created to add `soneium` to the contract upgrade tests in CI ([#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17332)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Implement Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy** ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17194)): The issue was initially closed as "Won't implement" by @alfonso-op. However, @ajsutton reopened it, noting a remaining TODO in the code referencing this issue, suggesting the TODO should be removed if the feature is truly not being implemented. @alfonso-op then requested @serpixel to remove the TODO and close the issue.
