### Precompile Address Initialization
Discussion continued on [#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16620) regarding the initialization of addresses 0x00-0xff with 1 wei balance and no contract code. The latest comment clarified that these are precompile addresses, and the 1 wei balance is normal due to obscure rules concerning empty accounts, ensuring they are not treated as empty.
