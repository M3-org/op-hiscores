### Enhanced Dependency Set Configuration
The issue concerning a configurable dependency set for L2 chains in supersim was closed today ([#361](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/361)). This enhancement allows users to specify a dependency set via a CLI flag, enabling more flexible testing scenarios for applications both within and outside a dependency set.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Op-node Interop Logic
Discussions continued on an issue regarding adding a mode to `op-node` to use pre-Interop logic in trivial-Interop cases ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16520)). The latest comment from tynes on July 7th at 16:34:20Z suggests considering a similar approach to `op-e2e` or `sysgo`, where all services run in the same process, and questions if this would be a viable solution. This issue is slated to be closed on July 9th.

### Flashblocks Gate Awareness
A new issue was opened and immediately closed today concerning the `flashblocks` gate's awareness of `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` ([#16630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16630)). The issue highlights the need for acceptance tests to validate streaming from `flashblocks-websocket-proxy`, not just `rbuilders`. An associated PR ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16584](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16584)) was linked.
