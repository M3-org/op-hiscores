## ACTIVE ISSUES
Discussions continued on several active issues:

*   **L1 Chain Configuration for L3s**
    Issue [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18070) discusses the ability for `op-node` and `op-program` to skip L1 chain configuration for L3s. The latest comments suggest that the system should automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID and apply L3 behavior, similar to how Mainnet and Sepolia are recognized.

*   **Transaction Gas Limit Issues with op-deployer**
    On issue [#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17912), a user reported that `op-deployer:v0.2.6` fails to deploy contracts due to a "transaction gas limit too high" error. The latest comment confirms that the Fusaka hardfork on Sepolia enforces a transaction gas limit cap of 16,777,216 (EIP-7825), causing large transactions to be rejected. It was suggested that transactions might need to be broken down or optimized. The commenter also noted that `v0.2.6` is an older version and recommended using `v0.5.0*`, though its post-Fusaka compatibility is yet to be tested.

*   **Improving Acceptance Test Execution**
    Issue [#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/469) addresses the challenges of running acceptance tests without the monorepo. A new comment highlighted that modifying devnets with options often doesn't work because orchestrator fields are private.
