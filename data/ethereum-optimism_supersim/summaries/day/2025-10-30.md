# ethereum-optimism/supersim Daily Update (Oct 30, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's activity focused on dependency updates and discussions around L1 chain configuration for L3s, transaction gas limits, and improving acceptance test execution outside the monorepo.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#418](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/418), was opened to update the `github.com/consensys/gnark-crypto` dependency from version 0.16.0 to 0.18.1.

### L1 Chain Configuration for L3s
Discussions continued on [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18070) regarding the ability for `op-node` and `op-program` to skip L1 chain configuration for L3s. The latest comments suggest that the system should automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID and apply L3 behavior, similar to how Mainnet and Sepolia are recognized.

### Transaction Gas Limit Issues
On [#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17912), a user reported an issue with `op-deployer:v0.2.6` failing to deploy contracts due to a "transaction gas limit too high" error. A contributor confirmed that the Fusaka hardfork on Sepolia enforces a transaction gas limit cap (EIP-7825), causing large transactions to be rejected. It was suggested that transactions might need to be broken down or optimized. The contributor also noted that `op-deployer` v0.5.0* is the latest version and would test it post-Fusaka.

### Improving Acceptance Test Execution
Discussions on [#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/469) highlighted challenges in running acceptance tests without the monorepo. A new comment pointed out that modifying devnets with options often doesn't work because orchestrator fields are private.
