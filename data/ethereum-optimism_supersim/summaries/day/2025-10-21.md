## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Fusaka Readiness and Prestate Updates**
Discussions continued on preparing for the Fusaka upgrade. For [#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/682) (op-geth: prepare for Fusaka), it was clarified that the Sepolia update is complete, but the Mainnet update is still pending. Similarly, for [#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/1206) (fusaka-defense: write superchain-ops task for updating the absolute prestate), the Sepolia prestate update has been executed, and the issue remains open to track the Mainnet task.

**Development Environment Setup Challenges**
An issue regarding Optimism `mise install` errors due to a version prefix "v" ([#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17963)) received a comment suggesting that the problem lies with the latest `mise` version and recommends using the install script from the latest `develop` branch for a compatible version.

**Observability in Sysgo**
A new comment on [#17941](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17941) (feat(tests): enable observability/monitoring in sysgo) suggested that this issue might be a duplicate of an existing issue in the main Optimism repository.
