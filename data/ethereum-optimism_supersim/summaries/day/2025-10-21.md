## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fusaka Upgrade Preparations
Discussions continued on the `op-geth` preparation for Fusaka [#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/682), with a recent comment clarifying that the Sepolia update is complete, but the Mainnet update is still pending. Similarly, the task for updating the absolute prestate for Fusaka [#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/1206) has been executed on Sepolia, and there's an open question about keeping the ticket active to track the Mainnet task.

### Build Environment Setup
An issue regarding an Optimism `mise install` error due to a version pre-fix "v" [#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17963) received a comment explaining that this is an issue with the latest version of `mise`. The recommended solution is to use the `install_mise.sh` script from the latest develop branch of the Optimism repository, which provides a compatible version of `mise`.
