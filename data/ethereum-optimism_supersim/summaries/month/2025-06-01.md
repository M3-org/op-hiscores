# ethereum-optimism/supersim Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
June was a month of focused stabilization, optimization, and tooling refinement for the Superchain ecosystem. Development efforts centered on diagnosing and hardening core components, with significant discussions and investigations into `op-supervisor` event handling, `op-batcher` memory consumption, and `op-geth` CPU performance. While major feature releases were not the focus, `supersim` itself was enhanced to improve testing flexibility. A substantial number of issues related to CI/CD, developer tooling, and testing were resolved, reflecting a strong push to improve the overall developer experience and pipeline reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Concrete development work this month focused on enhancing the simulation environment's flexibility and ensuring its components are up-to-date.

*   **Enhanced Configuration and Dependency Management:** To improve testing flexibility, `supersim` was updated to support configurable dependency sets ([#407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/407)). This allows developers to simulate and test against chains outside the standard interop set. Additionally, the core `GasTank` component was updated to its latest version to align with `interop-lib` changes, ensuring the simulation environment remains current with protocol specifications ([#406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/406), [#412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/412)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was highly active, with a significant number of closures focused on infrastructure and tooling, alongside deep investigations into performance and stability of core services.

### Closed Issues
A major cleanup of the issue tracker occurred, resolving numerous tasks related to infrastructure, testing, and developer experience.
*   **CI/CD & Tooling:** A large batch of issues was closed, marking significant progress in pipeline stability and automation. This included an investigation into CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16271)), the conclusion of a spike on CI SLAs ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16437)), and numerous improvements to `superchain-ops` tooling for task automation, simulation, and validation ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/337), [#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/648), [#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/514)).
*   **Feature & Testing Completion:** Several long-standing feature and testing initiatives were finalized. Key closures include the completion of acceptance testing for flashblocks transactions ([#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/354)), enabling flashblocks on the `eris-0` devnet ([#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16468)), and resolving the need to modify predeploys for testing ([#393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/393)).
*   **Documentation:** Issues related to documentation were addressed, including fixing a broken link ([#283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/283)) and updating guides for bridging ERC-20 tokens ([#1508](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/1508)).

### New & Active Issues
Discussions on active issues reveal a strong focus on the performance, stability, and interoperability of the OP Stack.
*   **`op-supervisor` Stability:** A primary focus was on the `op-supervisor`. Discussions continued on a critical issue where event overflow could cause non-recoverable crash-loops ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16335)). A new investigation was opened into spikes of `local-derived` and `local-unsafe-received` events ([#16603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16603)). Relatedly, the team debated the need for an `op-node` "trivial-interop" mode that could operate without a supervisor to ease the transition for chain operators ([#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16519)).
*   **Performance Optimization:** Performance bottlenecks were a key concern. A spike to optimize `op-batcher` memory consumption ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16537)) used `pprof` to identify the compressor as the main culprit, leading to proposals for shared compressors. Separately, an issue regarding abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/613)) gained significant traction, with multiple users providing diagnostic data to pinpoint the cause.
*   **Ecosystem & Protocol Enhancements:** New issues were opened to expand Supersim's capabilities, including a request to add Uniswap V4 deployment ([#409](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/409)) and a feature for user-specified contract logging to improve debuggability ([#411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/411)). A bug was also filed for a broken dependency in `op-chain-ops` ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16612)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
June showcased strong collaborative dynamics, both within the core team and with the broader community.
*   **Collaborative Debugging:** Complex issues saw deep collaboration. The `op-supervisor` event overflow issue ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16335)) involved detailed back-and-forth between developers @axelKingsley, @nonsense, and @sebastianst. Similarly, the `op-batcher` memory investigation ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16537)) saw @geoknee and @sebastianst working together on analysis and solutions.
*   **Community Engagement:** The investigation into high `op-geth` CPU usage ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/613)) was a prime example of community-driven problem-solving, with users like @rrrengineer, @Creamers158, and @PierrickGT providing valuable `pprof` data and logs. Furthermore, an issue to reduce noisy terminal output ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/781)) attracted interest from several potential new contributors, including @JoseValperga, @nsancheznez, @Mau1401, and @TheOnma.
*   **Technical Discourse:** Healthy debate on technical direction was evident in the discussion around automating the release pipeline ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16097)), where `protolambda` cautioned against adding new build systems without consolidation, while `geoknee` advocated for a user-friendly, one-click solution. This highlights a thoughtful approach to balancing developer convenience with long-term maintainability.
