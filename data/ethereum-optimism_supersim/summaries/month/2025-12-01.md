# ethereum-optimism/supersim Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Development work in December focused on enhancing the reliability and correctness of core node and challenger components. A key improvement was the implementation of external source following for the `op-node` light client, allowing it to mirror external safe and finalized data feeds. Concurrently, significant discussion centered on ensuring the `op-challenger` produces the correct trace output, particularly in edge cases where a super root is not found, with progress being made toward a final resolution.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Based on the provided reports for this period, no new features, bug fixes, or other code changes were merged into the repository. Development activity was concentrated on issue resolution and discussion.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management was a primary focus, with progress made on node functionality and challenger behavior.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **`op-node` Light Client Functionality:** An issue was resolved to enable external source following for safe/finalized data in `op-node`. This feature, activated via the `--l2.follow.source` flag, allows a node to mirror an external feed to reach the correct state ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18317)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **`op-challenger` Trace Output:** An active discussion continued around ensuring the `op-challenger` provides the correct trace output when the next super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18643)). While it was confirmed that the super node trace provider now handles this scenario correctly, the issue remains open. The path to resolution involves adding an integration test to confirm alignment between `op-challenger` and `op-program`, as `op-supervisor` will not be fixed due to its planned deprecation.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration during this period was evident in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. The ongoing conversation around the `op-challenger` trace output ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18643)) highlights a collaborative effort to diagnose a complex problem, confirm the behavior of related components, and define the necessary steps (like a new integration test) to ensure a robust solution.
