# ethereum-optimism/supersim Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September's efforts centered on hardening the mainnet sequencer infrastructure. The most significant achievement was the successful deployment and stabilization of flashblocks across all OP Labs mainnet sequencers, a major step in improving network performance and health. This was complemented by enhancements to sequencer health monitoring, including the rollout of `op-conductor` with new p2p healthchecks. The month also saw a focus on maintenance and cleanup, with the removal of several obsolete smoke tests and updates to developer documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, no new features, bug fixes, or code refactors were merged during this period. Development activity focused on dependency management, with a new pull request opened to update the `vite` dependency in the `tictactoe` example application ([#416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/416)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was a primary focus, with significant progress made in resolving infrastructure tasks and planning future work.

-   **Closed Issues:** A large number of issues were closed, primarily related to infrastructure stability and maintenance.
    -   **Flashblocks & Sequencer Health:** The core achievement was the successful deployment of flashblocks on mainnet sequencers, tracked in issues [#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16759), [#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16760), and [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17317). Related work included resolving alerts for sequencer peer counts ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16868)) and confirming the release of `op-conductor` with EL p2p healthchecks ([#17153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17153)).
    -   **Test & Documentation Cleanup:** A series of outdated proof-related smoke tests for components like `op-challenger` ([#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/141)), `op-dispute-mon` ([#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/142)), and `op-proposer` ([#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/143)) were removed. Documentation for bridging ETH was also updated to include examples for custom chains ([#1473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/1473)).
    -   **Feature Deprecation:** A decision was made not to implement Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy, and the corresponding issue was closed ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17194)).

-   **New & Active Issues:** New issues were opened to scope future enhancements and improve test coverage.
    -   An enhancement was proposed to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program` specifications to improve performance ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17416)).
    -   A new issue was created to expand CI by adding `soneium` to the contract upgrade tests ([#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17332)).
    -   The issue regarding Kurtosis Websockets support ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17194)) saw discussion around ensuring a related `TODO` comment was removed from the codebase, demonstrating diligent issue and code management.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active management of issues. For instance, the discussion on issue [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17194) involved multiple team members to ensure that closing the issue as "won't implement" was followed by the necessary code cleanup, showcasing a coordinated approach to maintaining code quality.
