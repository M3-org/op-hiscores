# ethereum-optimism/supersim Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of significant enhancements to the supersim environment, focusing on integrating core ecosystem components and improving testing flexibility. Key achievements include the integration of UniV4 deployments and updates to the latest `GasTank` version, expanding the simulation's capabilities for complex protocol interactions. The team also resolved a long-standing issue regarding interop prestate configuration by improving genesis tooling, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to protocol safety. These developments collectively advance supersim's role as a robust testing and simulation platform for the Superchain.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on integrating essential components and updating dependencies within the simulation environment.

- **UniV4 Integration:** In a major feature addition, UniV4 deployments were added to supersim, making UniV4 contracts available as part of the chain addresses. This enhancement, completed in PR [#397](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/397), enriches the simulation environment for testing future protocol interactions involving this key DeFi primitive.

- **GasTank Component Update:** The `GasTank` component was updated to its latest version across two pull requests ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/413), [#414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/414)). This involved updating the `interop-lib` gitsubmodule and modifying several genesis files to ensure the most recent `GasTank` commit is deployed, keeping the simulation environment current with protocol dependencies.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in July focused on resolving configuration challenges, improving testing infrastructure, and discussing future interop logic.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Interop Prestate Configuration:** A significant issue regarding the validation of `CrossL2Inbox` configuration in the EL prestate ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/15765)) was closed. The team concluded that improvements to the `op-deployer` genesis generation tool sufficiently mitigate the risk, making a client-side check unnecessary.
    - **Testing Flexibility:** An enhancement to allow for a configurable dependency set for L2 chains via a CLI flag was completed ([#361](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/361)), providing more flexible testing scenarios.
    - **Infrastructure Deployment:** A `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` was successfully deployed in op-sepolia to support flashblocks-enabled sequencers ([#16686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16686)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Op-node Interop Logic:** Discussions are ongoing for adding a mode to `op-node` to handle pre-Interop logic ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16520)). A recent suggestion explores running all services in a single process, similar to `op-e2e`.
    - **Code Style Enforcement:** An effort to add a semgrep rule for function naming conventions ([#15115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/15115)) is currently blocked due to GitHub Actions being disabled on the repository.
    - **Test Target Integration:** Work continues on improving acceptance test compatibility across different networks, with discussion on [#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/375) linking to related work in the `optimism` and `infra` repositories.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month highlighted a focus on pragmatic, cross-repository solutions. The decision to close the interop prestate validation issue ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/15765)) in favor of a tooling-based fix shows a mature approach to problem-solving driven by key contributors like `ajsutton`. Furthermore, the discussion around improving acceptance test setup ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/375)) points to active coordination between the `supersim`, `optimism`, and `infra` projects, ensuring that testing infrastructure evolves cohesively across the ecosystem.
