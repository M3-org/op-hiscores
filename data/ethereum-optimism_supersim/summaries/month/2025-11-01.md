# ethereum-optimism/supersim Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
November's development efforts centered on enhancing project stability, operational preparedness, and refining core protocol architecture. Key activities included routine security updates to dependencies and the creation of a new runbook to address potential batcher throughput issues, improving operational resilience. Concurrently, significant architectural discussions took place regarding the design of dispute games, specifically debating the coupling between fault dispute games and the `AnchorStateRegistry`, which will inform future protocol development.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month focused on maintaining the health and security of the codebase.

### Dependency Maintenance
To ensure the project benefits from the latest security patches, work was initiated to upgrade core dependencies. A pull request ([#419](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/419)) was opened to bump the `golang.org/x/crypto` library from version 0.35.0 to 0.45.0.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on improving operational procedures and debating future architectural patterns.

- **Closed Issues:** An important issue regarding low batcher throughput ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16959)) was closed. The resolution was the creation of a runbook to guide responses when the `MinBaseFee` is set too high, which could otherwise prevent transactions from being included.

- **New & Active Issues:** While no new major issues were opened, a significant architectural discussion is ongoing in issue [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18347). The debate centers on the dependency of `IFaultDisputeGame` on `AnchorStateRegistry`. Contributors are weighing the necessity of a specific sanity check against the goal of keeping components loosely coupled, a decision that will impact the future design of the dispute game system.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was most visible in the deep architectural discussions surrounding the project's core components. The active debate on issue [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18347) highlights a healthy process of community engagement in key design decisions. The different perspectives shared on the `AnchorStateRegistry` dependency demonstrate a commitment to rigorous technical review and finding the most robust architectural solution for the dispute game mechanism.
