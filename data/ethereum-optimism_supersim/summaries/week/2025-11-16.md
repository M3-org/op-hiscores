# ethereum-optimism/supersim Weekly Report (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on protocol maintenance, operational readiness, and key architectural discussions for dispute games. A notable achievement was the creation of a runbook to address potential batcher throughput issues, enhancing system reliability. Progress was also made on keeping dependencies current with an update to a core crypto library. Meanwhile, an important architectural debate continued regarding the design of fault dispute games and their dependencies, signaling a focus on long-term protocol integrity.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on routine but important maintenance tasks to ensure the project's security and stability.

- **Dependency Maintenance**
  - To incorporate the latest security patches and improvements, a pull request ([#419](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/419)) was opened to bump the `golang.org/x/crypto` library from version `0.35.0` to `0.45.0`.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving an operational concern and continuing a significant architectural discussion.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Batcher Throughput:** An issue concerning low batcher throughput caused by a high `MinBaseFee` was closed ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16959)). A runbook was created to provide clear guidance for responding to similar incidents in the future, improving operational preparedness.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were opened this week.
  - **Dispute Game Architecture:** A significant discussion is ongoing in issue [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18347) regarding the `IFaultDisputeGame`'s dependency on `AnchorStateRegistry`. The debate centers on whether an explicit sanity check is needed to ensure the game's anchor registry matches the canonical one, or if existing deployment-time checks and other mechanisms are sufficient. This conversation is critical for defining the final interface and security model for dispute games.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was most visible in the detailed architectural debate surrounding the dispute game implementation ([#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18347)). The active discussion highlights the team's focus on carefully considering design trade-offs and ensuring the long-term robustness of the protocol's core components through collaborative decision-making.
