# ethereum-optimism/supersim Weekly Report (Jul 6 - 12, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on maintaining alignment with core Optimism components and resolving key issues related to Interop configuration. The `GasTank` component was updated to its latest version across the supersim environment, ensuring simulations run with the most recent contract logic. A significant long-standing issue regarding Interop prestate validation was closed, with the team deciding to rely on improved genesis tooling for safety rather than implementing client-side checks. This reflects a broader theme of enhancing testing flexibility and ensuring the stability of the simulation environment through pragmatic tooling improvements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on integrating updates from dependent libraries into the simulation environment.

- **GasTank Integration and Genesis Updates:** The `GasTank` component was updated to its latest commit to ensure it is deployed from the most recent version. This effort, captured in PRs [#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/413) and [#414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/414), involved updating the `interop-lib` gitsubmodule and modifying several genesis files to reflect the changes, keeping the simulation environment in sync with upstream developments.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Discussions this week led to the resolution of several issues, with a focus on Interop logic and testing configuration.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Interop Prestate Configuration:** A long-standing issue ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/15765)) concerning the validation of `CrossL2Inbox` configuration in the EL prestate was closed. The team concluded that the risk of misconfiguration has been sufficiently mitigated by improvements in the `op-deployer` genesis tooling, which now automatically handles the contract's inclusion. This strategic decision favors tooling-based solutions over adding complexity to the client.
    - **Enhanced Testing Flexibility:** An issue was closed to provide a configurable dependency set for L2 chains via a CLI flag ([#361](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/361)). This enhancement allows for more flexible testing scenarios.
    - **Flashblocks Awareness:** A brief issue ([#16630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16630)) was opened and closed, highlighting the need for acceptance tests to validate streaming from `flashblocks-websocket-proxy`.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`op-node` Interop Logic:** Discussion continued on issue [#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16520) regarding a mode for `op-node` to handle pre-Interop logic. A recent suggestion proposed exploring an approach similar to `op-e2e` or `sysgo`, where services run in the same process.
    - **Precompile Address State:** An ongoing discussion ([#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16620)) clarified that the 1 wei balance found in precompile addresses (0x00-0xff) is expected behavior due to rules preventing empty accounts, and does not indicate an issue.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the active discussions around key technical issues. The resolution of the Interop prestate configuration issue ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/15765)) demonstrated a consensus-driven approach, with the team opting for a pragmatic solution based on tooling improvements. Similarly, the ongoing brainstorming on `op-node`'s interop logic ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16520)) shows active engagement in finding the most viable technical path forward.
