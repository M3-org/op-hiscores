# ethereum-optimism/supersim Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on expanding the simulation environment's capabilities by integrating Uniswap V4. This key addition makes UniV4 contracts available within the simulation, enabling more complex and realistic protocol interaction testing. Alongside this feature work, infrastructure was enhanced with the deployment of a `flashblocks-websocket-proxy`. Discussions also continued around improving code quality through automated style enforcement and refining the acceptance testing framework for broader compatibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary technical achievement was the integration of Uniswap V4 into the `supersim` environment.

- **UniV4 Integration:** In a significant enhancement to the simulation's scope, UniV4 deployments were added to `supersim`. This work, completed in PR [#397](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/397), makes UniV4 available as part of the chain addresses in viem by updating genesis files and contract sources, paving the way for future simulations involving the protocol.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this period involved resolving infrastructure and process-related items, while discussions on active issues point toward future improvements in code quality and testing.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Infrastructure:** A `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` was successfully deployed in the op-sepolia environment to connect with flashblocks-enabled sequencers ([#16686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16686)).
    - **Internal Process:** An internal issue related to a Q4 2024 audit was closed, likely for tracking and documentation purposes ([#1701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/1701)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened.
    - **Code Style Enforcement:** An ongoing discussion in [#15115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/15115) aims to add a semgrep rule to enforce that private/internal functions begin with an underscore. Progress is currently blocked as the `copilot-swe-agent` reported that GitHub Actions are disabled for the repository.
    - **Test Framework Improvements:** Issue [#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/375) continues to explore how to better incorporate test target setup and teardown to improve the compatibility of acceptance tests. Recent comments link to related work in the `optimism` and `infra` repositories, indicating a cross-cutting effort.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident through cross-repository considerations. The discussion on improving acceptance test compatibility ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/375)) included links to related efforts in the main `optimism` and `infra` repositories, highlighting coordination across the broader Optimism ecosystem. Additionally, the use of automated tooling like `copilot-swe-agent` in issue [#15115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/15115) demonstrates an ongoing effort to streamline development workflows.
