# ethereum-optimism/supersim Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity, based on data from September 11th, was dominated by the successful deployment and stabilization of flashblocks across mainnet sequencers. This significant operational milestone saw the closure of numerous related issues, including the rollout to all OP Labs infrastructure sequencers and the resolution of associated monitoring alerts. The team also focused on maintenance and cleanup, removing several obsolete proof-related smoke tests and updating documentation for bridging ETH. While no new code was merged, new issues were opened to enhance `op-program` and improve contract upgrade testing in CI.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring were merged based on the available reports. Development activity was centered on issue management and planning for future work. A new pull request ([#416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/416)) was opened to update the `vite` dependency in the `tictactoe` example application.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was the primary focus, with a significant number of issues closed related to a major feature rollout and ongoing system maintenance.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Deployment & Sequencer Health:** A major effort was concluded with the successful deployment of flashblocks on mainnet sequencers ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16759), [#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16760), [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17317)). Corresponding alerts for sequencer peer count were also resolved ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16868)). Additionally, the release of `op-conductor` with EL p2p healthchecks was completed ([#17153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17153)).
    - **Testing & Documentation Cleanup:** Several outdated proof-related smoke tests for components like `op-challenger`, `op-dispute-mon`, and `op-proposer` were removed as they are no longer required ([#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/140), [#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/141), [#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/142), [#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/143)). A documentation update was also completed to add examples for custom chains when bridging ETH ([#1473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/1473)).
    - **Tooling Deprecation:** A decision was made not to implement Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy, leading to the closure of the related issue ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17194)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Future Enhancements:** New issues were created to plan future work, including adding a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program` ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17416)) and adding `soneium` to the contract upgrade tests in the CI pipeline ([#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17332)).
    - **Active Discussion:** Issue [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17194) regarding Kurtosis Websockets support saw notable discussion. After being closed, it was briefly reopened to ensure a related `TODO` in the codebase was removed, highlighting active collaboration to ensure tasks are fully completed.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the issue triage process. The discussion on issue [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17194) between members @alfonso-op, @ajsutton, and @serpixel demonstrated effective peer review and follow-through, ensuring that the decision not to implement a feature was correctly reflected in the codebase by removing associated comments. The week's activity reflects a team focused on successful operational rollouts and diligent maintenance of the project's health.
