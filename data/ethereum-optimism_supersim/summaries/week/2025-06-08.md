# ethereum-optimism/supersim Weekly Report (Jun 8 - 14, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were centered on investigation and in-depth discussion rather than code implementation. No new features or fixes were merged. Instead, significant progress was made in diagnosing complex, high-priority issues, including a potential crash-loop in the `op-supervisor` and persistent CI flakiness. Discussions also advanced the planning for significant changes to the Fault Proof creator contract, while new community feedback highlighted a need for clearer documentation around local development environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No pull requests were merged this week. All development activity was focused on investigating and discussing active issues.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week's activity was concentrated on triaging and advancing discussions on existing and newly created issues.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Protocol Stability & Bugs:** A critical discussion unfolded in [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16335) concerning an `op-supervisor` event overflow that can lead to non-recoverable crash-loops. Contributors are actively debugging the root cause, with analysis suggesting that `"cross-unsafe-update"` events, rather than `ChainIndexingContinueEvent`s, might be the source of the problem. Meanwhile, the long-standing bug [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/623), where `eth_getTransactionCount` returns an incorrect nonce, remains active with users inquiring about progress.
    - **Fault Proofs & Infrastructure:** Planning for OPCM changes to the Fault Proof creator contract continued in [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/15789), with a detailed task list provided and a related pull request in the main `optimism` repository linked. Separately, investigation into CI flakiness is ongoing in [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16271), indicating a broader effort to improve infrastructure stability.
    - **Developer Experience:** A new issue, [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/399), was opened to seek clarification on the differences between `supersim` and the `interop kurtosis devnet` for local development, highlighting an opportunity to improve developer onboarding documentation.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week showcased strong collaborative debugging and planning. The discussion around the `op-supervisor` crash-loop ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/16335)) involved detailed back-and-forth between core contributors like @axelKingsley, @nonsense, and @sebastianst. Similarly, @stevennevins provided a comprehensive plan for the Fault Proof contract changes in [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/15789). Community engagement was also evident, with user `mukul3097` prompting for an update on an active bug and another user opening an issue to improve clarity on development environments.
