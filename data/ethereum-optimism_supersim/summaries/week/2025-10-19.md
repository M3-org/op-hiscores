# ethereum-optimism/supersim Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on planning and maintenance in preparation for the upcoming Fusaka upgrade. Discussions progressed on critical infrastructure tasks, with work on the Sepolia testnet being completed while the corresponding Mainnet updates remain pending. Attention was also given to developer environment stability, with a workaround provided for a build tool issue. The only code change proposed was a routine dependency update, reflecting a period focused on infrastructure readiness over new feature development.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
No new features, bug fixes, or major refactoring were merged this week. Development activity was limited to dependency maintenance.

- **Dependency Maintenance:** A pull request [#417](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/417) was opened to update the `vite` development dependency for the `tictactoe` example application.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week, and no new issues were opened. Triage and discussion focused on existing issues related to the Fusaka upgrade and developer environment setup.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Fusaka Upgrade Preparations:** Discussions continued on key infrastructure issues for the Fusaka upgrade. For both the `op-geth` preparation [#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/682) and the absolute prestate update [#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/1206), work has been completed on Sepolia. The conversations now focus on tracking the pending updates for Mainnet.
    - **Build Environment:** A developer-facing issue regarding an error with `mise install` [#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17963) was addressed. A comment clarified the problem stems from a recent `mise` version and provided a solution: use the `install_mise.sh` script from the `develop` branch to install a compatible version.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident through the ongoing technical discussions on active issues. The dialogue around the Fusaka upgrade tasks indicates active coordination among team members to track progress across different networks (Sepolia vs. Mainnet). Additionally, the prompt response to the `mise` build issue demonstrates a commitment to supporting developers and maintaining a stable development environment.
