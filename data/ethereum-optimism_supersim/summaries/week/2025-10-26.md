# ethereum-optimism/supersim Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on maintenance and critical discussions addressing ecosystem evolution. A key dependency update was proposed to keep the project current. Meanwhile, significant conversations took place regarding future improvements, including a proposal to streamline L3 configuration by having `op-node` automatically detect L2 chains. The community also focused on resolving deployment failures on Sepolia caused by the recent Fusaka hardfork's gas limit cap and explored ways to improve the standalone execution of acceptance tests.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week included a focus on maintaining the project's dependencies.
- **Dependency Maintenance:** A pull request ([#418](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/pull/418)) was opened to update the `github.com/consensys/gnark-crypto` dependency from v0.16.0 to v0.18.1, ensuring the project stays aligned with the latest cryptographic libraries.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week. Discussions were concentrated on several active issues impacting deployment, testing, and L3 configuration.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **L3 Configuration Simplification:** In issue [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18070), discussion continued on enabling `op-node` and `op-program` to handle L3s without explicit L1 configuration. The latest proposal suggests the system should automatically detect if the configured "L1" is a known L2, thereby applying L3 behavior dynamically.
    - **Sepolia Deployment Failures:** A significant discussion on issue [#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/17912) addressed `op-deployer` failures on Sepolia. It was confirmed that the Fusaka hardfork enforces a transaction gas limit cap (EIP-7825) that causes large deployment transactions to be rejected. Suggestions include breaking down transactions or upgrading from the older `op-deployer:v0.2.6` to a more recent version.
    - **Acceptance Testing Blockers:** A conversation in issue [#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/469) highlighted ongoing challenges in running acceptance tests outside the monorepo. It was noted that private fields in the orchestrator prevent necessary modifications to devnets, acting as a blocker for more flexible testing setups.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community engagement this week was characterized by collaborative problem-solving around key infrastructure challenges. The discussions on active issues show a proactive approach to addressing the real-world impacts of network upgrades, such as the Fusaka hardfork on Sepolia. Contributors are actively diagnosing issues, sharing findings, and proposing solutions for critical tooling like `op-deployer` and the acceptance testing framework.
