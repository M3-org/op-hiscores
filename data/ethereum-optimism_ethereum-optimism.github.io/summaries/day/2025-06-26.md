# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Jun 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in refining the Superchain-Ops tooling, with numerous issues related to task simulation, testing, and architecture being closed. A new pull request was opened, and discussions continued on optimizing release pipelines and local development environments.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Superchain-Ops Tooling Refinements:** Several improvements were made to the Superchain-Ops tooling, including addressing issues with `SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER` behavior ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/448)), updating task paths for mainnet ([#600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/600)), and ensuring prevalidations are not hindered by the address registry availability ([#654](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/654)).
*   **CI/CD and Testing Enhancements:** Efforts focused on optimizing CI job performance and improving testing methodologies. This included making the `template_regression_tests` CI job faster ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/648)), updating tests to use `contracts-bedrock safe-tools` and `stdStorage` library ([#605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/605)), and checking domain hashes from simulation against `VALIDATIONS.md` ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/679)).
*   **Task Management and User Experience:** Improvements were made to task management and the overall user experience within the Superchain-Ops framework. This involved supporting "stacked" proposals with incrementing nonces ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/342)), automatically running tasks in CI if in a non-terminal state ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/337)), and providing a quick way to read addresses for chains not in the superchain registry ([#923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/923)).
*   **Documentation and Training:** Documentation and training efforts were completed to support the new Superchain-Ops tooling. This included updating paths in improvement docs ([#548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/548)) and setting up training calls for internal stakeholders ([#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/514)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Superchain-Ops Tooling Enhancements:** Several issues related to the Superchain-Ops tooling were closed, including improvements to the OPCM Migrate Script ([#16326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16326)), addressing the `SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER` value check ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/448)), and fixing the `StateOverrideManager` always adding nonce as a state override ([#814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/814)).
*   **CI/CD and Testing Improvements:** Multiple issues focused on CI/CD and testing were resolved. This includes automatically running tasks in CI if in a non-terminal state ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/337)), supporting "stacked" proposals with incrementing nonces ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/342)), and making the `template_regression_tests` CI job faster ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/648)).
*   **Task Management and Documentation:** Issues related to task management and documentation were closed. This involved updating the fetch-task to use the mainnet task directory ([#547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/547)), updating paths in improvement docs ([#548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/548)), and updating task paths for mainnet tasks ([#600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/600)).
*   **Refactoring and User Experience:** Refactoring efforts and user experience improvements were completed. This included revisiting the `MultisigTask` architecture ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/636)), printing state diff in markdown format ([#777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/777)), and providing a simple UX for users to override Nonces ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/770)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Release Pipeline Automation:** Discussion on [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16097) (Use GoReleaser for op-node/batcher/proposer/challenger release pipeline) continued with `geoknee` suggesting wiring up `op-workbench release-notes` to automatically execute `git cliff` for release note generation and potentially push to GitHub via API. This builds on previous comments about committing changelog solutions to the codebase and using `git cliff` for lighter-weight changelog generation. `protolambda` previously emphasized the need to unify build systems and avoid adding more complexity without removing existing debt, while `sebastianst` clarified the primary goal was automated release note generation.
*   **Abnormal CPU Usage in op-geth:** On [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/613) (Abnormal CPU usage with latest op-geth (v1.101511.0)), `jsvisa` provided command-line arguments for `pprof` to capture CPU performance, suggesting the high usage might be temporary due to log indexing rebuild. `cpuchainorg` confirmed the issue persists even after index upgrade, indicating a potential broken goroutine. `hekich` noted that CPU usage returned to normal after the index upgrade completed.
*   **Refactoring `signFromChildMultisig`:** Issue [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/781) (Refactor signFromChildMultisig to reduce noisy terminal output) saw new interest from `JoseValperga` and `nsancheznez` offering to work on the improvement. `Cass402` previously identified the `print` function call within `simulateRun` as the source of the noisy output and proposed removing it, seeking feedback on whether a more selective reduction is preferred.
*   **Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet:** On [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/399) (what's the difference between supersim and interop kurtosis devnet?), `zhiqiangxu` clarified if supersim is mainly for testing dapps rather than chains. `fainashalts` previously explained supersim as a lighter-weight local tool (wrapper around anvil) for testing multichain/interop applications, while `tremarkley` highlighted its use for local development.
