# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Sep 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on expanding token data with the addition of LITKEY for Optimism and Base. Discussions on active issues included preparing for the Fusaka L1 activation and refining the `superchain-ops` flow.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Token Data Expansion
- Added LITKEY token data for Optimism and Base, including Sepolia support for both chains ([#1214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1214)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
- No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Engine API Validation Refinement
- A new issue was opened to discuss deduplicating Engine API validation checks in `Miner.prepareWork`, which are currently redundant with existing checks in `eth/catalyst/api_optimism.go` ([#688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/688)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Fusaka L1 Activation Preparation
- Discussion on [#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17472) centered on the `op-batcher`'s necessary behavioral changes when Fusaka activates on L1, specifically regarding sending blob transactions with cell proofs instead of blob proofs. A recipe for manual testing against a Fusaka L1 was shared.

### Improving Superchain Operations Flow
- On [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1224), feedback was provided on the `superchain-ops` signing flow. Key points included:
    - Clarification on why 'TODOs' are printed during task simulation for task developers, but not during signing.
    - Acknowledgment that the inclusion of audit reports was experimental and needs language adjustment.
    - Discussion on the necessity of `op-txverify` for different signers.
    - Suggestions for improving boilerplate markdown and the clarity of the "normalized state diff hash."
    - A PR was opened to address some of the raised snags.
