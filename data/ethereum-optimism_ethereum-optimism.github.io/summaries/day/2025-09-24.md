### Simulation and Testing Enhancements
Several issues related to simulation and testing within `superchain-ops` were closed. This includes the removal of etch from proposal simulation [#436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/436), new template tooling for E2E testing [#489](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/489), and the re-implementation of security council rehearsals [#529](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/529). Issues concerning easy task invocation [#593](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/593), `sim-seq` related tasks [#646](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/646), [#647](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/647), [#714](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/714), and the implementation of `checkStateDiff` in example templates [#608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/608) were also closed.

### CI Stability and Template Creation
Issues related to CI stability, such as `mise deps` rate limiting [#569](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/569) and general CI rate limits [#628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/628), were closed. A test failure with the latest Foundry version [#577](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/577) was also resolved. Additionally, the issue for creating a swap owner template [#1167](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1167) was closed.

## NEW ISSUES

### Testing and Code Quality Nits
New issues were opened to address minor improvements in testing and code quality. These include splitting assertions in tests [#17598](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17598), adding a helper function for `_authorizeMinter` [#17600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17600), and adding an explicit custom error [#17601](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17601).

### Superchain-Ops Flow Feedback
A new issue was opened to report snags encountered during the improved `superchain-ops` flow [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1224). This issue details several points of confusion and difficulties experienced during the signing process.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### [#17598](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17598) Split assertions in tests
This issue suggests splitting assertions in tests for better clarity and maintainability, specifically recommending separate `LiquidityController_Version_Test` for each assertion. Comments from `hexshire` link to related discussions on a pull request, indicating ongoing consideration of this testing practice.

### [#17600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17600) Add `_authorizeMinter(_minter)` as a helper function.
The discussion on this issue, initiated by `smartcontracts`, proposes creating a helper function `_authorizeMinter(_minter)` to improve code organization. `hexshire` provided a related link to a pull request discussion, suggesting active consideration of this refactoring.

### [#17601](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17601) Add explicit custom error
This issue, raised by `smartcontracts`, suggests adding an explicit custom error for a specific case. `hexshire` linked to a related discussion on a pull request, indicating that this suggestion is being reviewed.

### [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1224) snag report on improved superchain-ops flow
This issue details several points of confusion and difficulties encountered during the `superchain-ops` signing flow. `blmalone` provided a detailed response, addressing each point and mentioning a new pull request ([#1230](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1230)) that aims to fix some of the reported snags. Key points of discussion include the intentional printing of markdown with 'TODOs' during simulation for task developers, the experimental nature of audit reports in the workflow, the varying requirements for `op-txverify` among signers, and the need for better boilerplate markdown. `geoknee` further clarified the importance of simulation for signers and questioned the current approach.
