# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Jun 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in addressing flashblocks functionality, optimizing `op-batcher` memory consumption, and improving developer tooling for local environments. Several issues related to CI/CD and documentation were also resolved.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Flashblocks Integration and Testing
Efforts continued on integrating and testing flashblocks, with a focus on enabling them in non-interop environments and developing acceptance tests for transaction handling. This work is crucial for the reliability and performance of the Optimism network.
### `op-batcher` Memory Optimization and Observability
A spike was initiated to investigate and optimize the memory consumption of the `op-batcher`, particularly during L1 congestion. Initial findings suggest the compressor is a major memory consumer. Concurrently, a new issue was opened to enhance observability of `op-batcher` memory usage through `pprof` integration and CI tests.
### Developer Tooling and Local Environment Improvements
Improvements were made to developer tooling, specifically Supersim, to allow for easier modification of predeploys for testing purposes. Discussions also clarified the differences between Supersim and interop Kurtosis devnet for local development.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#1167](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1167), titled "Main", was opened. No further details on its status or progress are available.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Acceptance
The issue of enabling flashblocks on `eris-0` was closed, with completion across multiple phases involving `optimism-charts`, `devnets`, and `k8s` repositories. Additionally, acceptance tests for flashblocks transactions were completed, including transfer and streaming tests.
### CI/CD and Documentation Enhancements
A spike exploring CI SLAs was closed, with the decision not to implement them for now. A broken link in the documentation for `L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol` was also resolved.
### Developer Environment Improvements
The issue enabling users to modify predeploys was closed, as Supersim now supports modifying the `L2toL2CDM` predeploy.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-batcher` Memory Consumption Spike ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16537))
Discussions focused on identifying the source of high memory usage in the `op-batcher`. Initial profiling with `pprof` suggests the compressor is the primary culprit. Proposed optimizations include using a single compressor and more eagerly releasing compressor memory after channel submission. A recipe for running `pprof` locally was provided.

### `op-batcher` Observability of Memory Consumption ([#16572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16572))
The discussion highlighted the need for enhanced observability of `op-batcher` memory consumption. Suggestions include integrating `pprof` into Kurtosis devnet and creating CI tests to measure memory usage. Existing benchmarks for channel compressors were noted as a starting point, with a need to ensure they run locally, on CI, and are up-to-date with Brotli compression.

### CI SLAs Spike ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16437))
The discussion revolved around the proposed CI SLAs and accountability framework. Feedback from developers indicated that while SLAs are not inherently bad, some proposed metrics (e.g., 5% failure rate, 1-hour PR feedback time) were considered too high or long. Concerns were raised about disabling breaking checks and the relevance of PR merge time as a CI metric. The consensus leaned towards focusing on addressing flaky tests and being smarter about admitting new tests. The issue was ultimately closed with the decision not to implement CI SLAs for now.

### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/399))
The discussion clarified the distinction between Supersim and interop Kurtosis devnet. Supersim is described as a lighter-weight wrapper around Anvil, primarily for testing multichain/interop applications and upcoming features, while Kurtosis is used for chain development. The main use case for Supersim is for dapps testing.
