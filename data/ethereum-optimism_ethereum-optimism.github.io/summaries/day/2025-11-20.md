# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on adding a new token to the Base deployment and addressing a critical issue related to batcher throughput.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Token Integration
*   Added the `MR_LIGHTSPEED` token folder for the Base deployment, including SVG logo and metadata. The token is set with `nobridge: true` and an overridden on-chain name to display as "Mr Lightspeed Creator Coin" ([#1237](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1237)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#1239](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1239) titled "Feat/bob-token", was opened. Its status is pending.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Batcher Throughput Runbook
*   A runbook for low batcher throughput related to `min-base-fee` was created and the issue was closed. This runbook addresses how to respond if the `MinBaseFee` is set too high, leading to transactions not being included ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16959)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were created today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency
*   Discussion on [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18347) revolves around removing the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry`. The core problem is that the current check for `anchorStateRegistry()` via a cast to `IFaultDisputeGame` will not work for all game types. Suggestions include expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface to require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method, or questioning the necessity of the sanity check given deployment time checks.
