# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on adding a new token to the Base deployment and addressing a critical issue related to batcher throughput.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Token Integration
*   Added the `MR_LIGHTSPEED` token folder for the Base deployment, including its SVG logo and metadata. The token is configured with `nobridge: true` and an overridden on-chain name to display as "Mr Lightspeed Creator Coin" ([#1237](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1237)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#1239](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1239) titled "Feat/bob-token", was opened, indicating potential future token integration work.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Batcher Throughput Runbook
*   A runbook for addressing low batcher throughput due to a high `MinBaseFee` was created and linked, leading to the closure of the issue ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16959)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency
Discussion on [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18347) revolves around removing the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry`. The core debate is whether the sanity check requiring `anchorStateRegistry()` from the dispute game is necessary, given deployment-time checks. One suggestion is to expand the `IDisputeGame` interface to explicitly require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method.
