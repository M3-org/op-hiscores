### op-batcher Fusaka Compatibility
Discussion on [#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17472) focused on preparing the `op-batcher` for Fusaka activation. The issue was reopened to cover releasing a new batcher version that includes auto-switching to cell proofs and incorporates the mainnet Fusaka time via `op-service` / `op-geth`. Previously, manual testing against a Fusaka L1 was suggested.

### op-batcher Shutdown Behavior
The issue [#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17768) addresses the `op-batcher`'s shutdown behavior when the "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" error occurs. The latest thinking is to maintain the current detection logic and ensure the shutdown exits the entire process, not just part of the batcher. This would allow the batcher to enter a crashloop and automatically recover when the `SetMaxDASize` RPC method becomes available again.
