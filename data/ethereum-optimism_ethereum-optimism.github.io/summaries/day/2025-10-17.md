### op-batcher: Fusaka Preparation and Shutdown Logic
Discussions on [#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17472) focused on preparing the `op-batcher` for Fusaka activation on L1. The latest comment indicates a plan to re-open the issue to cover releasing a new batcher version that includes auto-switching to cell proofs and incorporates the mainnet Fusaka time via `op-service` / `op-geth`.

Issue [#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17768) addresses the `op-batcher`'s shutdown behavior when the "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" error occurs. The latest thinking is to maintain the current detection logic but ensure the shutdown exits the entire process, not just part of the batcher. This would allow the batcher to enter a crashloop and automatically recover when the `SetMaxDASize` RPC method becomes available again.
