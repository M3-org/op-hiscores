### Precompile Address Initialization Clarification
A discussion continued on [#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16620) regarding the initialization of addresses 0x00-0xff with 1 wei balance in the OP Stack. The latest comment from tynes clarified that these are precompile addresses, and the 1 wei balance is intentionally set due to "obscure rules in how empty accounts work," ensuring they are not treated as empty accounts.
