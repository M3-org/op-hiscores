### Event System Discussion
Discussion continued on [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16874) regarding the implementation of an event call graph. On August 14th, @sashass1315 mentioned submitting a PR for review. On August 15th, @pcw109550 responded, indicating that while the contribution was appreciated, the team is leaning towards removing the entire event system, suggesting the PR might not be merged but the code could still be useful for understanding control flow during the system's removal.
