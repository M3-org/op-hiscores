## NEW ISSUES
### Data Availability Error Codes
A new issue, [#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/725), was opened to add missing Super DA error codes, specifically for data availability errors caused by reorgs, which are currently absent from the specification.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-node` Goroutine Stuck Issues
Issue [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16332) continues to track the problem of `op-node` (v1.13.3) getting stuck with thousands of goroutines, primarily in `select`, `IO wait`, or `yamux` session handlers, leading to sync failures. A user reported experiencing the same issue on `op-node` v1.13.3, providing a detailed goroutine dump.

### `op-supervisor` Event Overflow
Discussions on [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16335) focused on the `op-supervisor` entering a crash-loop due to an event overflow when the unsafe head gap is large. The team is investigating which event type is causing the overflow. One suggestion was to add a counter per event type to gather more debugging data. It was clarified that `ChainIndexingContinueEvent`s are not expected to stack up, suggesting another event type might be the culprit.

### Release Pipeline Automation
Issue [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16097) is tracking the effort to use GoReleaser for the `op-node`/`batcher`/`proposer`/`challenger` release pipeline. The latest comments discuss the desire for a one-click solution for generating high-quality and accurate changelogs, potentially by integrating `git-cliff` or similar tools into `op-workbench`.

### Persistent Devnet Test Acceptance
Issue [#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/398) is tracking the progress of getting all tests running and passing in persistent devnets. A recent update indicates that L1 Faucet support has been added, which is a step towards completing this work.

### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet
Issue [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/399) seeks clarification on the differences between supersim and interop Kurtosis devnets. A comment clarified that supersim is a lighter-weight wrapper around Anvil, primarily used for testing multichain/interop applications locally, while Kurtosis is used for the underlying op-stack chain development. The discussion continues to explore the main use cases for supersim.

### Interop EL Prestate Check
Issue [#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15765) discusses whether the execution client should check the EL prestate for pre-interop `CrossL2Inbox` configuration faults. The latest comment argues that the execution client is not well-suited for this validation due to dependency and world state availability challenges. It suggests that the genesis generation tooling (op-deployer) has mitigated this risk by automatically deciding whether `CrossL2Inbox` should be included based on the number of chains and interop activation, making a client-side check less necessary.
