## CLOSED ISSUES

### Addressing Redundant Address Structs
The issue [#14977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/14977), which aimed to create a single source of truth for address structs across the codebase, was closed today. The scope of this issue was deemed complete.

## NEW ISSUES

### Standardizing Network Upgrade Transactions
A new issue, [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/781), was opened to enshrine a new convention for Network Upgrade Transactions that deploy new contracts. This issue highlights the current practice of using a unique account with `nonce=0` as the `from` address for such transactions and seeks to establish a more robust and collision-resistant method.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Enshrine new convention for Network Upgrade Transactions which deploy new contracts ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/781))
Discussion on this newly opened issue immediately delved into the technical specifics of address collision resistance. @protolambda provided a detailed note explaining how `CREATE`, `CREATE2`, and the proposed upgrade source-hash computations differ in their keccak preimage, thus preventing address collisions. They also suggested an extra-safe approach using `CREATE2` computation with a system address as the deployer and the source-hash as the salt, to fit within existing address computation frameworks and prevent future unexpected collisions.
