## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Flashblocks Enablement on Sunnyside Sepolia Sequencers**
Issue [#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16688) was closed today. The latest comment from parkgunou confirmed that all Sunnyside sequencers for Sepolia are running with Flashblocks and are connected to the websocket proxy. They also noted that failover has been tested on the eris-0 devnet, marking the issue as resolved from their side. Previously, yashvardhan-kukreja had indicated that this issue was deprioritized in favor of getting Flashblocks stable on OP Labs Sepolia infra, and that issue [#16685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16685) was a blocker.

**Missing Test Logs in `op-acceptance-tests`**
Issue [#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17151) was opened today. scharissis commented that the "go-tests-short" workflow job is not intended for acceptance tests and that the few sysgo acceptance tests it runs are not via `op-acceptor`, which would capture logs. They are working on moving these tests, which should resolve the issue.
