### Batcher Configuration Resolution
The `op-batcher SetMaxDASize` issue, related to RPC availability and throttling, was closed due to inactivity, suggesting the problem may have been resolved or is no longer a priority. ([#15355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15355))

### Op-Node Interop Logic Deprioritization
The issue to add a mode for using pre-Interop logic in the `op-node` for trivial-Interop cases was closed, indicating a shift in prioritization for this feature. ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16520))

## NEW ISSUES
### Fault Proof Incident Runbook Review
A new issue was opened to conduct a final review of the v3 fault proof incident runbook and remove its "draft" label, ensuring it is ready for use. ([#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16651))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes
Discussions on the `Fault Proof creator contract OPCM changes` ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15789)) are ongoing, with a detailed checklist of tasks being addressed. The latest update from stevennevins outlines several action items including moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, removing `anchorStateRegistry` from `StandardValidatorOverrides`, unskipping and updating tests in `DeployOPChain.t.sol`, reviewing comment responses, addressing TODO comments, and rebasing updates from EVM safety refactoring.

### Abnormal CPU Usage with op-geth
The issue regarding `Abnormal CPU usage with latest op-geth (v1.101511.0)` ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/613)) continues to be discussed. PierrickGT provided a `profile.pb.gz` file and noted that the performance issue might have been due to an index update, which took about 24 hours to complete. Previous comments from jsvisa and hekich also suggested that high CPU usage could be temporary due to log indexing rebuilds after backporting go-ethereum v1.15.11. cpuchainorg, however, expressed concerns about persistent high CPU usage and the quality assurance of op-geth releases.

### RV Audit - TestCrossSafeUpdate Testing Impossible Cases
Discussion on `RV Audit - TestCrossSafeUpdate testing impossible cases` ([#16548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16548)) saw a new comment from DeVikingMark, who created a pull request for review. The issue highlights a test that sets a custom `openBlockFn` to return `ErrAwaitReplacement`, suggesting a potential problem with testing impossible scenarios or a lack of clear `invalid` signals during Hazard Set construction.
