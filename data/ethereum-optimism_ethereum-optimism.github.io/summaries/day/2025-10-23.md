## CLOSED ISSUES
### Game Type Retrieval Refinement
The issue concerning forwards-compatible gameType retrieval in OPCM, [#17933](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17933), was closed today. The resolution indicates that the necessary changes were incorporated as part of other work, and current OPCM functions dealing with `gameType()` are now primarily V1-specific or handled via feature toggles.
