# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Jun 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, specifically addressing a missing `dist` directory in the `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` npm package. Additionally, new token data for BTREE and Bridged EURC was added, expanding the supported assets within the ecosystem.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Token Data Expansion
New token addresses were added for BTREE on Optimism and Optimism-Sepolia, and Bridged EURC was added to Lisk, enhancing the range of supported assets within the Superchain ecosystem.
- Add BTREE token addresses ([#1143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1143))
- Add Bridged EURC to Lisk ([#1157](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1157))

### Critical Package Fix
A significant bug was resolved where the `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` npm package was missing its `dist` directory in versions after 10.0.238, causing import errors. This fix ensures proper package functionality.
- Fix missing dist directory in published npm package ([#1161](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1161))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Tokenlist Package Issue Resolution
A critical issue regarding the `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` package missing its `dist` directory was closed. This problem, which prevented the package from being imported correctly, has been resolved with the merge of PR #1161.
- `10.0.238` is the last version that includes a `dist` directory ([#1146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1146))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI Flakiness Investigation
Discussions continued on investigating and improving CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16271)). The latest comments highlight the release of a "Flakiness Report" generator and its subsequent iteration, which now includes "Job Name" to help identify the backend used and potential sources of flakiness. This report aims to provide better visibility into the issue.

### Acceptance Test Reliability
The ongoing effort to improve the reliability of acceptance tests ([#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16378)) saw further discussion. A key point raised was the importance of measuring flakiness by package rather than by individual test, as tests within the same package (e.g., `multisupervisor_interop`) can interfere with each other and boost flakiness. The new "Flakiness Report" is also relevant here, providing insights into which tests are most flaky.
