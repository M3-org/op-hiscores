## NEW ISSUES
### Min-Base-Fee State Growth Estimation
A new issue was opened to add a state growth estimate to the Financial Modeling Analysis (FMA) for the `min-base-fee` feature [#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/316). This is to quantify the impact of adding an extra byte for `minBaseFeeLog2` per block, estimating approximately 16MB of state growth per year.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-test-sequencer` Integration
Discussion continued on integrating `op-test-sequencer` into the devnet environment and Kurtosis [#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15265). A recent comment clarified that this integration is required to run reorg tests within the `kona-supervisor` devstack environment. Previously, the issue was re-opened due to a pending todo in the code, despite earlier deprioritization.

### `min-base-fee` Specification
Regarding the `min-base-fee` specification [#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/742), a comment today indicated that the state growth estimate, initially considered for this ticket, was better placed in the FMA and is now being tracked under a separate issue [#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/316). The initial request for a state growth estimate was to include it in the motivation section of the specs.
