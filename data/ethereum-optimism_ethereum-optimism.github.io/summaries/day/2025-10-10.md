### Addressing `op-dispute-mon` Out-of-Sync Node Handling
Discussion continued on [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17814) regarding how `op-dispute-mon` should handle situations where one of its configured rollup RPCs is behind. The core problem is that the monitor currently detects a disagreement when a behind node returns an older state, rather than using an in-sync node as the source of truth.

Key points from the discussion:
*   **Initial Proposal:** A suggestion was made to use `syncStatus` to determine the expected current L2 head. If a requested L2 block is in the future, it should be treated as such. If not, results from behind nodes should be ignored and logged.
*   **Concerns about Highest Block:** A counter-argument highlighted that simply trusting the highest L2 block might be problematic, as it could originate from a node that followed an incorrect fork.
*   **Focus on L1 Block Processing:** A more robust approach proposed checking the `CurrentL1` from the sync status to determine if a node has processed the L1 block where the dispute game was created. This would indicate if the node is sufficiently in sync.
*   **Partial Solution:** A related PR, [#17819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/17819), is expected to reduce the problem to cases where a real output root not found error occurs.
*   **Accidental Closure and Reopening:** The issue was briefly closed by mistake and then reopened, pending the merge of the related PR.
