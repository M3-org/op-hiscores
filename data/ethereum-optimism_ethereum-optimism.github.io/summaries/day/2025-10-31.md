## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblocks Monitoring and Configuration
Discussion continues on an alert for when a non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16867)). The latest comment questions the current relevance of the ticket and whether a detection mechanism for disabled flashblocks already exists.

### Acceptance Test Parallelization
The status of parallelizing the "memory-all" job in `op-acceptance-tests` is being re-evaluated ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17525)). The latest comment notes that the PR addressing this was auto-closed and asks if the task is still desired.

### Unused Acceptance Tests
A discussion is ongoing regarding the reporting of unused acceptance tests ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16273)). The latest comment asks if this feature is still a priority.

### L2 Key Handover Test Investigation
The relevance of investigating the L2 key handover test after a refactor is being questioned ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/643)). The latest comment seeks clarification on whether this issue remains pertinent.

### Proxyd Time Travel Issue
A new issue regarding proxyd's ability to "travel back in time" when backends are out of sync has been opened ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/501)). A related issue with more details has been referenced.
