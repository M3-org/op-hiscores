## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Registry Enhancements and Refinements
Several issues related to the Superchain Registry were closed, indicating significant progress in its development. This includes improvements to diff tools, checking config parameters for each chain, and addressing a CI flake related to `add-chain` tests. Additionally, the issue of adding chain names to `addresses.json` was closed, with the decision not to implement it due to potential breaking changes. ([#284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/284), [#294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/294), [#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/635), [#999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/999))

### Test Infrastructure and CI Workflow Improvements
Issues concerning the `op-acceptance-tests` workflow were addressed, including making the workflow blocking and updating the `add-chain` script to handle input variations. A CI flake related to the `add-chain` help flag was also resolved. ([#16270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16270), [#220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/220), [#477](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/477))

### Documentation and Configuration Updates
Documentation and configuration-related issues were closed, such as adding verification guides to OP docs, including `L2ProxyAdminOwner` in TOML files, and supporting Holesky testnets. The issue of adding contract implementation addresses to superchain config was also closed. ([#17145](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17145), [#470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/470), [#518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/518), [#520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/520))

### Flashblocks and Deployment Tooling
Issues related to flashblocks alerts and `op-deployer` improvements were closed. This includes tuning a flashblocks alert for Sepolia and addressing `op-deployer` logs and Etherscan verification on Sepolia. ([#17716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17716), [#18089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18089))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fault Proofs Contract Address Management
Issue [#604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/604) discusses overhauling how fault proofs contract addresses are stored and discovered. The latest comment from `janjakubnanista` indicates the issue is closed as fixed by [#14757](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14757). Previous discussions highlighted the complexity of tracking `DelayedWETH` and other fault proof contracts due to frequent changes and the desire to use the blockchain as the primary source of truth rather than the registry. There was a debate on whether to list all contract addresses or a minimal set, with `ajsutton` advocating for listing only `DisputeGameFactory` due to the dynamic nature of other fault proof implementations.

### Superchain Registry L1 RPC URL Management
Issue [#609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/609) focuses on moving the L1 RPC URL from Superchain initialization to validation. `janjakubnanista` confirmed that this issue is closed as it has been addressed by the refactor. Previously, `alfonso-op` noted that this would be reassessed post SR 2.0 refactor.

### `op-acceptance-tests` Parallelization
Issue [#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17525) aims to parallelize the "memory-all" job in `op-acceptance-tests` to prevent increased CI duration once the workflow becomes blocking. `janjakubnanista` inquired if this is still desired, given that the PR addressing it was autoclosed.

### `op-acceptance-tests` Unused Test Reporting
Issue [#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16273) discusses discovering and reporting unused acceptance tests. `janjakubnanista` asked if this is still a desired feature. Earlier, `alfonso-op` suggested a "staging" gate for tests that run but don't block merges, allowing for a path to promote them to blocking checks.

### Flashblocks Sequencer Alerting
Issue [#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16867) proposes an alert for when a non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off. `zhwrd` questioned if this ticket is still relevant or if a detection mechanism for disabled flashblocks already exists. `jelias2` previously mentioned that an alert would be created once a related PR lands.

### `golang-validate-all` Job Summary
Issue [#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/644) aims to update the `golang-validate-all` CI job to provide a summary of passes/failures. `janjakubnanista` asked if this has been addressed by SCR 2.0. `jmcoplabs` previously moved the issue to backlog, awaiting a refactor to decouple the golang test framework from the validation core logic.

### `L2ProxyAdminOwner` Encoding Exceptions
Issue [#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/675) concerns encoding `ProxyAdminOwner` exceptions for Base and Unichain. `janjakubnanista` believes this has been addressed with SCR 2.0. `alfonso-op` noted it was blocked on Unichain launch, and `bitwiseguy` had previously sought clarification on the standard address and scope of the 3/3 multisig.

### `proxyd` Backwards Time Travel
Issue [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/501) describes a scenario where `proxyd` can "travel back in time" if backends are not in sync. `alfonso-op` linked a related issue ([#17688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17688)) for more details.

### L2 Key Handover Test Investigation
Issue [#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/643) calls for an investigation into the L2 key handover test. `janjakubnanista` asked if this is still relevant after the refactor.
