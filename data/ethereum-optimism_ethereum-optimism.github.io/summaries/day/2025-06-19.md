## ACTIVE ISSUES

**`op-supervisor` Event Overflow Investigation**
Discussions continued on [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16335) regarding the `op-supervisor`'s potential to enter a crash-loop due to event overflow. The latest comment from `nonsense` (Jun 19, 2025) indicates a new PR has been created to add a gauge for all in-flight events within the `GlobalSyncExec`. This aims to identify which specific event type causes issues and potentially set up alerts if a threshold is crossed. Previous discussions debated whether `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` or `"cross-unsafe-update"` events were the primary culprits, with `axelKingsley` clarifying that `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` should not stack up.

**Clarifying Local Development Environments**
The discussion on [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/399) continued to explore the differences between `supersim` and `interop kurtosis devnet` for local development. The latest comment from `zhiqiangxu` (Jun 19, 2025) sought clarification on `supersim`'s primary use case, specifically asking if it's mainly for testing dapps rather than chains. This follows earlier explanations that `supersim` is a lighter wrapper around Anvil for multichain/interop application testing.
