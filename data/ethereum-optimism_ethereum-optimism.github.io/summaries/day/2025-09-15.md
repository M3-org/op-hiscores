# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Sep 15, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant activity in adding new tokens to the Base network, including FLIXX, MDEX, CANA, and ZKC. An issue regarding token discoverability was also addressed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### New Token Integrations on Base
Several new tokens were added to the Base network, expanding its ecosystem. This includes the FLIXX token ([#1195](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1195)), MDEX (MasterDEX Token) ([#1196](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1196)), CANA Holdings California Carbon Credits ([#1197](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1197)), and ZKC, the native token of the Boundless protocol ([#1198](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1198)).

### Token Discoverability Enhancement
An update was made to remove the 'nobridge' flag for the ARCV2 token, ensuring its addresses and bridges are discoverable ([#1202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1202)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Load Testing and Partner Support Evaluation
Load testing for flashblocks on devnets was completed, with results summarized in a Notion document ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16756)). Similarly, the evaluation of partner support criteria on eris-0, leveraging flashblocks enablement, was also concluded and documented ([#16765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16765)).

### Data Availability Footprint Limit Threat Modeling
The threat modeling and failure modes analysis for the DA Footprint Limit were completed and documented on Miro ([#336](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/336)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Token Bridging and Configuration Concerns
A new issue was opened seeking clarification on why a token, despite being merged, is not bridging to its counterpart on Base, suggesting a potential configuration mismatch ([#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1203)).

### Incorrect ETH Address on Optimism-Sepolia
An issue was reported regarding an incorrect address for ETH on Optimism-Sepolia, noting that the provided address is a normal address on the testnet rather than an ERC token address ([#1201](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1201)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Receipt Correction: Failed to decode RLP receipts ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/679))
The issue of Geth crashing with "Failed to decode RLP receipts" during full sync on op-mainnet was confirmed and is under investigation. A potential fix has been suggested for testing.

### Dispute game creator pattern refactor: update specs ([#17436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17436))
Discussion is ongoing regarding whether this issue is a duplicate of another and if the intent is to delve deeper into the constructor and `implArgs` functionality.
