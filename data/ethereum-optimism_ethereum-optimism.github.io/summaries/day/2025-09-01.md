Issue [#17042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17042), concerning `op-proposer` errors, was closed. The errors, primarily `GameAlreadyExists`, were clarified as expected behavior when the safe head has not advanced, leading to no new valid proposals. The resolution suggests ensuring the batcher is running correctly and considering shortening its maximum channel duration for more frequent proposals.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Dispute Monitor Support for New Game Types
Issue [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17286), "Kona + Cannon: op-dispute-mon support," remains active. The discussion revolves around the need for `op-dispute-mon` to support `cannon-kona` game types.

The issue was updated to specifically state "Update to support cannon-kona games."
