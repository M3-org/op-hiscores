### Batcher Simplification
Discussion continued on [#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18479) regarding the removal of `isPectra` from the batcher. The latest comment from `geoknee` at 2025-12-08T09:41:24Z confirmed that `Himess` can proceed with the changes, which are estimated to affect around 5 Go files. The issue proposes simplifying the batcher by assuming Pectra is enabled on L1, as the fork occurred some time ago.
