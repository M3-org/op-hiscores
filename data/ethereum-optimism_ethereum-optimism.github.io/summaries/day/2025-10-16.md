## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-conductor: Failed to start sequencer
*   An issue was reported where a sequencer failed to start with the error "no unsafe head" after linking the conductor. A request for assistance was made in the comments ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17899)).

### jovian/operator-fee/GPO: revisit saturating math issue in operatorFee getter
*   Discussion continues regarding the use of saturating math versus reverting on overflow for the `operatorFee` getter. The latest comment suggests that an analysis might imply no need for any saturating math in this context ([#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17888)).
