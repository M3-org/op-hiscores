# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Oct 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day focused on expanding token listings across the Superchain, with several new tokens added and one updated. Significant progress was also made in closing out issues related to DA Footprint Limit testing and sequencer demotion.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Token List Expansion
*   Added ATTN to the Superchain token list, enhancing interoperability within the ecosystem ([#1212](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1212)).
*   Integrated MIRROR token onto the Base network ([#1209](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1209)).
*   Introduced DSTRX token to the Superchain ([#1208](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1208)).
*   Added Realio Network (RIO) token to the mainnet ([#1207](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1207)).

### Token Address Updates
*   Updated the Witnet (WIT) token address on Sepolia, including its description and bridge overrides ([#1215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1215)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1224) Settle WIT addresses on Ethereum and Base
*   [#1223](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1223) Add ENSC to lisk

## CLOSED ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Testing
*   Closed the issue for writing acceptance tests for the DA Footprint Limit, with resolution via a pull request in the `optimism` repository ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17278)).
*   Resolved the issue concerning the addition of unit tests for the DA Footprint Limit, referencing a pull request in `op-geth` ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17395)).

### Sepolia Sequencer Management
*   Closed the issue regarding the demotion and lightening of `op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1` on Sepolia. The resolution involved keeping the sequencer in the voter set and removing `prod-sepolia-op-opn-geth-f-sunnyseq-1` instead ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17683)).

## NEW ISSUES
*   No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-conductor Sequencer Failure
*   Issue [#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17899) reports a sequencer failure with the error "no unsafe head" after linking `op-conductor`. The user is seeking assistance to resolve this.

### Operator Fee Saturating Math
*   Issue [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17888) discusses revisiting a potential saturating math issue in the `operatorFee` getter. The latest comment suggests that an analysis might indicate no need for saturating math, referencing a discussion in a design document.
