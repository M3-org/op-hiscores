# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Oct 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day focused on expanding token listings across the Superchain, with several new tokens added and one updated. Significant progress was also made in closing out issues related to DA Footprint Limit testing and sequencer demotion.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Token List Expansion
*   Added ATTN to the Superchain token list, enhancing interoperability within the ecosystem ([#1212](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1212)).
*   Integrated MIRROR token onto Base, expanding available assets on the network ([#1209](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1209)).
*   Introduced DSTRX and RIO tokens to the Superchain, broadening asset diversity ([#1208](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1208), [#1207](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1207)).

### Token Address Updates
*   Updated the Witnet (WIT) token address on Sepolia and its bridge overrides, ensuring accurate token representation ([#1215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1215)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1224) Settle WIT addresses on Ethereum and Base.
*   [#1223](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1223) Add ENSC to lisk.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Testing
*   Closed an issue related to writing acceptance tests for the DA Footprint Limit, with resolution via a pull request in the `optimism` repository ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17278)).
*   Resolved the issue concerning the addition of unit tests for the DA Footprint Limit, referencing a pull request in `op-geth` for the solution ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17395)).

### Sepolia Sequencer Management
*   Closed an issue regarding the demotion and lightening of the `op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1` on Sepolia. The resolution involved removing `prod-sepolia-op-opn-geth-f-sunnyseq-1` instead, keeping the original sequencer in the voter set ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17683)).

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-conductor Sequencer Failure
*   **[#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17899) op-conductor :Failed to start sequencer, err="no unsafe head"**: A user reported a sequencer failure with the error "no unsafe head" after linking `op-conductor`. The issue was opened today, and a request for assistance was made by the user.

### Operator Fee Saturating Math
*   **[#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17888) jovian/operator-fee/GPO: revisit saturating math issue in operatorFee getter**: Discussion continues regarding the necessity of saturating math in the `operatorFee` getter. A recent comment suggests that a linked analysis might imply no need for saturating math, indicating an ongoing review of the mathematical implementation.
