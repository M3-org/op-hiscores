# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Oct 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on minor data updates, specifically adding a new LSK address to the Base network. Discussions continued on active issues concerning DA Footprint Limit implementation, `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` marshalling, and improving `op-up` for local development.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Data Updates
*   Updated LSK addresses by adding a new LSK address for the Base network. ([#1210](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1210))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Developer Tooling Improvements
*   An issue was opened to improve `op-up` to serve as a `sysgo` runner during development, aiming to replace Kurtosis for local devnet spin-up. ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17942))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Implementation
Discussion on issue [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17551) indicates that the implementation is currently blocked by a pending spec derivation, specifically referencing `optimism/issues/17946`.

### Rollup Configuration Marshalling
On issue [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17907), the conversation revolves around whether to avoid marshalling new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active, due to it breaking some zk stacks. A suggestion was made to update `op-succinct/kailua` instead of adding a nullable system config, with further internal discussion planned to assess this possibility and the general justification for not updating APIs in an uncoordinated way.

### Improving `op-up` for Local Development
Issue [#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17942) discusses the need to enhance `op-up` to function as a local devnet tool, replacing Kurtosis. A comment suggests considering if a CLI tool is truly necessary, given the simplicity of creating long-running acceptance tests.
