## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI/CD Enhancements for `op-geth` Integration
Discussions on [#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/665) centered on improving CI practices for `op-geth` changes. A new suggestion (Option C) was proposed to implement a periodic job in the monorepo that checks for the latest `op-geth` commit from the `optimism` branch. This job would notify via Slack if it fails, aiming to quickly alert to integration issues, though it acknowledges potential false alarms.

### Documentation for OP Stack Rollup Deployment
Issue [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1530) saw a significant update with a user (`krofax`) sharing a "rich PR" ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705/](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705/)) that overhauls the existing "Create an op stack Rollup testnet with op-deployer" guide. This indicates progress towards clearer and more up-to-date documentation for deploying OP Stack testnets. Earlier comments highlighted confusion due to mixed documentation approaches (manual vs. `op-deployer`) and concerns about high RPC calls when using the permissioned fault-proof system.

### Flashblock Tests for Persistent Devnets
Issue [#17248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17248) received a comment reiterating the need to enable flashblock tests against persistent devnets. The task is described as "XS-S" in size, suggesting it's a relatively small and straightforward piece of work to ensure correct functionality.
