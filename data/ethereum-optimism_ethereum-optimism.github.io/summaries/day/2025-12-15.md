# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Dec 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure with a new test for circulating supply data. Discussions on active issues covered critical bug reports, P2P connection stability, and interop transaction evaluation, with significant community engagement on diagnostics and solutions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Testing Infrastructure Enhancements
A new test was added to validate the circulating supply file, ensuring its existence and correct format. This is crucial for dashboards relying on this data [#1247](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1247).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Kona Interop Test Evaluation
A new issue was opened to ensure that Kona interop action tests are not disabled, highlighting a potential duplication with an existing issue in the `op-rs/kona` repository [#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18613).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fault Proof System Stability
Discussion on [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18608) centered on a `nil pointer dereference` error in `op-challenger` related to `RecordBlobBaseFee`. The issue arises when the L1 chain does not support blob transactions (e.g., an older Geth version). The user provided detailed logs and suggested adding a flag similar to `--data-availability-type=calldata` to prevent panics. The team requested more information on the `op-challenger` and L1 client versions to diagnose the problem further, emphasizing the criticality of the bug.

### Interoperability Transaction Rework
Issue [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18574) continues to discuss the evaluation and rework of injected replacement transactions for invalid interop transactions. The conversation highlighted the importance of the additional transaction for the proof system, as it records the replaced block hash, which is critical for preventing honest challengers from being overwhelmed. There was also a discussion about whether the Supernode could provide the necessary data to simplify the protocol by not adding an extra deposit transaction.

### Node Synchronization and P2P Stability
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18581) addresses a node synchronization problem with "missing trie node" errors. The latest comments requested detailed information on L1 Execution and Consensus client configurations, full logs, and client startup flags to aid in diagnosis. This indicates an ongoing effort to troubleshoot synchronization issues affecting various Optimism-based chains.

### Critical Bug in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction`
Issue [#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18554) reports a critical fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when `_7702Target` is `address(0)`. The latest comment emphasizes the severity of this bug, suggesting immediate prioritization with `bug` and `critical` labels, and assignment to a contracts developer to fix the logical error related to handling zero addresses and aliasing.

### P2P Connection Instability
Issue [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18570) discusses flakiness in `op-reth <-> op-geth` P2P connections during system tests. The latest comment recommends classifying this as a major bug or high-priority chore due to its impact on test stability and potential production compatibility. It also suggests assigning a developer to investigate differences in P2P implementations and `admin_peers` encoding.
