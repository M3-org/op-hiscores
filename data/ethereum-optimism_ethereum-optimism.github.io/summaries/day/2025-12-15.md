# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Dec 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure with a new test for circulating supply data. Active discussions continued on critical issues including `op-challenger` nil pointer dereferences, `OptimismPortal2` fuzzing test failures, and P2P connection flakiness.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Data Integrity Testing
A new test was added to ensure the integrity of the circulating supply file, which is crucial for dashboards. This test verifies the file's existence and content format, ensuring it contains a single positive number. ([#1247](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1247))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Addressing `op-challenger` Nil Pointer Dereference
Discussion on [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18608) centered on a `nil pointer dereference` error in `op-challenger` related to `RecordBlobBaseFee`. The issue appears when the L1 chain does not support blob transactions (e.g., an older Geth version not upgraded to Dencun). The user `lyh169` confirmed the setup involves a local private chain with Geth v1.13.15, which lacks Blob tx support. `rdin777` requested more details on the `op-challenger` version and L1 client configuration to help diagnose and patch the issue, suggesting the problem lies in uninitialized `BlobBaseFee` fields. `ajsutton` questioned the setup, noting that L1s not supporting base fees wouldn't typically work with the fault proof system.

### Investigating `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` Fuzzing Failure
Issue [#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18554) highlights a critical fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when `_7702Target` is `address(0)`. `rdin777` emphasized the severity of this bug, indicating potential incorrect behavior when handling deposits involving the null address and its impact on aliasing. They recommended immediate prioritization with `bug` and `critical` labels, and assignment to a contracts developer to fix the logical error in line 2688, which involves etching empty bytes.

### Resolving `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` P2P Connection Flakiness
The discussion on [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18570) concerns P2P connection instability in system tests, specifically between `op-reth` and `op-geth` nodes. `rdin777` classified this as a major bug or high-priority chore due to its impact on test environment stability and potential production compatibility. They suggested assigning the task to someone capable of deep-diving into the P2P implementation differences and verifying `admin_peers` encoding.

### Evaluating and Reworking Injected Replacement Transactions
Issue [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18574) discusses the protocol's handling of invalid interop transactions by inserting Replacement Blocks. `ajsutton` stressed the importance of the additional transaction for the proofs system, arguing it's critical for identifying the original block hash without re-running derivation, which could overwhelm honest challengers. They also noted that the fixed gas cost of the inserted transaction is unlikely to exceed the block gas limit. `axelKingsley` questioned if the Supernode could supply the necessary data for proofs, potentially simplifying the protocol by not adding an extra deposit transaction. `Inphi` agreed that while the additional transaction is needed for proofs, the Supernode should ideally generate what's required, suggesting simplification by avoiding the extra deposit transaction.

### Diagnosing Node Synchronization Issues
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18581) reports a node synchronization problem with errors like "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload." `rdin777` indicated these errors typically point to the L1 Execution Client failing to provide necessary state data to the Op-Node. They requested detailed information on client configurations (L1 Execution and Consensus Clients), full logs for Op-Node and L1 Execution Client, and complete startup flags for all three clients to aid diagnosis. `tsulhc` mentioned similar issues with Publicnode snapshots but found success with `snapsync` using `--syncmode=execution-layer` for a new Unichain node. `yaki-1337` and `bayardar` confirmed experiencing similar problems across multiple nodes on Base/Optimism/Unichain, particularly when using `op-geth` and Publicnode snapshots.

### Finalizing U18 Releases
Issue [#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18548) tracks the finalization of Upgrade 18 releases. `rdin777` requested an update from `pauldownman` on two key blocking factors: governance approval for `op-program` and the status of testnet runs, specifically if any critical issues were found that could delay finalization.

### Offloading Expensive Operations in `kona-sp1`
Issue [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18533) discusses ensuring expensive EVM operations like keccak and sha2 are offloaded to the host in `kona-sp1` for performance and correctness in the SP1 zkVM. `rdin777` inquired about the progress in identifying all areas where these operations occur outside the EVM and if other computationally expensive operations might require a similar offloading approach.
