# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Dec 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure with a new test for circulating supply data. Active discussions continued on critical issues including `op-challenger` panics, `OptimismPortal2` fuzzing failures, and P2P connection flakiness, with community members actively contributing to diagnostics and potential solutions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Data Integrity Testing
A new test has been added to validate the circulating supply file, ensuring its existence and correct format. This is crucial for dashboards relying on this data. ([#1247](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1247))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-challenger` Panic Due to BlobBaseFee
Discussion on [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18608) centers around a `nil pointer dereference` in `op-challenger` when the L1 does not support `blobBaseFee`. The user `lyh169` confirmed the issue occurs with an old Geth version that is not Dencun-upgraded and lacks Blob transaction support. `rdin777` requested more details on the `op-challenger` and L1 client versions to aid in diagnosis, suggesting the panic likely stems from an uninitialized `BlobBaseFee` field. `ajsutton` questioned the setup, noting that L1s not supporting base fees would not typically work with the fault proof system.

### Interoperability: Evaluating and Reworking Injected Replacement Transactions
Issue [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18574) discusses the necessity and implementation of replacement transactions for invalid interop transactions. `Inphi` suggested simplifying the protocol by not adding an extra deposit transaction, believing the Supernode should be able to generate necessary proof data. `axelKingsley` supported this, proposing that the Supernode's recorded denylists could act as a "SafeDB" for replacements. `ajsutton` countered, emphasizing that the additional transaction recording the replaced block hash is critical for the proof system to prevent overwhelming honest challengers and that there is no real risk of exceeding the block gas limit due to fixed gas costs and reserved system transaction gas.

### Node Synchronization Issues
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18581) reports nodes failing to synchronize with "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. `rdin777` indicated these errors typically point to the L1 Execution Client failing to provide necessary state data to the Op-Node. They requested detailed information on client configurations (L1 Execution, L1 Consensus), full logs, and startup flags to diagnose the problem. `tsulhc` noted similar issues with Publicnode snapshots but found success with `snapsync` using `--syncmode=execution-layer` for a new Unichain node.

### `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` Fuzzing Test Failure
On issue [#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18554), `rdin777` highlighted a critical fuzzing test failure when `_7702Target = address(0)` in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction`. This indicates a potential logical error in handling deposits with a null address and its impact on aliasing. `rdin777` recommended immediate prioritization with `bug` and `critical` labels, assigning a contracts developer to fix the logic error at line 2688, which involves etching empty bytes, to ensure the L1/L2 bridge functions correctly under edge cases.

### `kona-sp1`: Offloading Expensive Operations to the Host
Issue [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18533) discusses the need to offload expensive EVM operations like `keccak` and `sha2` to the host for performance in the `kona-sp1` program. `rdin777` emphasized the criticality of this for ZK Proofs and asked `lnphi` about progress in identifying all areas where these operations occur outside the EVM and if other computationally expensive operations might require a similar approach.

### Finalizing U18 Releases
Issue [#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18548) tracks the finalization of Upgrade 18 releases. `rdin777` requested an update from `pauldownman` on two key blocking factors: whether governance approval for `op-program` has been received and if any critical issues were found during testnet runs that could delay the finalization of U18 releases.

### `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` Connection Flakiness
Issue [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18570) addresses P2P connection flakiness in system tests involving mixes of `op-geth` and `op-reth` nodes. `rdin777` classified this as a major bug or high-priority chore due to its impact on test stability and potential production compatibility. They suggested assigning someone to investigate the P2P implementation differences and verify the correctness of `admin_peers` encoding.
