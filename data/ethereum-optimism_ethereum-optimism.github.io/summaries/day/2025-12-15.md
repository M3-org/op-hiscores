# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Dec 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure with the addition of a new test for circulating supply data. Discussions on active issues covered critical bug reports, synchronization problems, and interop transaction evaluations, highlighting ongoing efforts in protocol security and client compatibility.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Data Integrity Testing
A new test was introduced to validate the circulating supply file, ensuring its existence and correct format. This is crucial for dashboards relying on this data. ([#1247](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1247))

## NEW ISSUES
### Fault Proof System Stability
A new issue was opened regarding a nil pointer dereference in `op-challenger` when the L1 does not support `blobBaseFee`, indicating a potential vulnerability in the fault proof system with older L1 clients. ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18608))
### Kona Interop Test Evaluation
An issue was created to ensure that Kona interop action tests are not disabled, highlighting the need to verify and enable these critical tests. ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18613))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona-SP1 Optimization for ZK Proofs ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18533))
Discussion revolves around offloading expensive cryptographic operations like keccak and sha2 to the host for performance and correctness in the kona-sp1 program. The latest comment from @lnphi clarifies a notification mix-up and points to @Inphi for further action, indicating ongoing efforts to optimize ZK Proofs.

### Finalizing Upgrade 18 Releases ([#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18548))
The issue concerns the finalization of Upgrade 18 releases. @rdin777 requested an update on governance approval for `op-program` and any critical issues found on the testnet, emphasizing the importance of these blocking factors for a major update.

### OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction Fuzzing Test Failure ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18554))
A critical bug report details a fuzzing test failure when `_7702Target = address(0)` in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction`, suggesting a potential logical error in handling deposits with a null address. @rdin777 recommended immediate prioritization, labeling as critical, and assigning a contracts developer to address the issue.

### Fixing op-reth <-> op-geth Connection Flakiness ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18570))
The discussion highlights P2P connection instability in system tests when mixing `op-geth` and `op-reth` nodes. @rdin777 suggested classifying this as a major bug or high-priority chore and assigning a developer to investigate P2P implementation differences and `admin_peers` encoding.

### Evaluating and Reworking Injected Replacement Transactions ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18574))
The conversation focuses on simplifying the protocol by eliminating additional deposit transactions for proofs. @rdin777 noted a consensus to simplify the protocol by removing the extra deposit transaction for proofs, suggesting architectural refactoring and updating the Interop specification. @Inphi and @axelKingsley agreed that the Supernode should be able to generate necessary data for proofs, simplifying the protocol. @ajsutton previously emphasized the criticality of the additional transaction for the proofs system and dismissed concerns about exceeding block gas limits.

### Node Synchronization Issues ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18581))
Users are reporting synchronization problems with error messages like "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload." @rdin777 requested more information on L1 Execution and Consensus client configurations, full logs, and client flags to diagnose the issue. @yaki-1337 is seeking information on where to download snapshots with the latest blocks.

### op-challenger: Invalid Memory Address or Nil Pointer Dereference ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18608))
A critical bug report details a nil pointer dereference in `op-challenger` when the L1 does not support `blobBaseFee`. @rdin777 requested details on the `op-challenger` version, L1 client, and L1 configuration to investigate the issue, particularly focusing on `txmgr` metrics initialization. @lyh169 confirmed the issue occurs with an old Geth version that does not support Dencun and Blob transactions, providing specific versions and logs. @ajsutton initially questioned the setup, stating that no L1 without base fee support would work with the fault proof system.
