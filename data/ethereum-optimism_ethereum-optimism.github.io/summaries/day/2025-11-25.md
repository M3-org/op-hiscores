## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Investigating Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug
Discussions continued on [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18350) regarding a possible bug in op-node sequencer recovery mode. @sebastianst provided a potential fix snippet to prevent recovery mode from producing temporary errors when it reaches the tip. @geoknee further investigated why temporary errors persist and how the L1 origin is not advancing when the sequencer is in recovery mode but the chain is healthy, potentially leading to stalled derivation. The influence of asynchronous L1 origin fetching from a recent PR is also being considered.
