### Investigating Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug
Discussions continued on [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18350) concerning a possible bug in op-node sequencer recovery mode. @sebastianst provided a potential fix snippet to prevent temporary errors when recovery mode reaches the tip. @geoknee further investigated why temporary errors persist and noted that an explicit check on sequencer drift is skipped in recovery mode. The conversation highlighted that when the sequencer is in recovery mode on a healthy chain, it might request a non-existent L1 origin block, leading to "not found" errors and a stalled L1 origin, which violates the sequencer drift rule. The influence of asynchronous L1 origin fetching from a recent PR is also being investigated.
