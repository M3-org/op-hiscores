## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona + Cannon Support in OPCM
Discussions continued regarding the necessary changes in OPCM to support Kona + Cannon. A comment from `ajsutton` on September 3rd, 2025, indicated that OPCM needs to support deploying the new game type, specifically highlighting a section in `contracts-bedrock` that will require updates. `pauldowman` on September 2nd, 2025, suggested confirming if any changes are truly needed before closing the issue. ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17285))

### Kona + Cannon Support in op-dispute-mon
The conversation around `op-dispute-mon` support for Kona + Cannon games saw `pauldowman` on September 2nd, 2025, clarifying the issue description to "Update to support cannon-kona games." Earlier, `ajsutton` on September 1st, 2025, questioned the initial phrasing "It needs a change to only look at specific game types," emphasizing that `dispute-mon` must error on unsupported games and will need to be updated to explicitly support `cannon-kana` game types.
