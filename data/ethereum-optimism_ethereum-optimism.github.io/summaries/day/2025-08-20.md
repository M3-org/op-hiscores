# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Aug 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing the robustness of RPC communication within the CI/CD pipeline by addressing timeout and rate-limiting issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced RPC Provider Reliability
A significant bug fix was implemented to improve the stability and resilience of RPC communication, particularly within CI/CD environments. This involved introducing a robust provider factory to mitigate issues like RPC timeouts and rate limiting, and to provide fallback mechanisms when primary RPC endpoints fail.
- Fixed RPC timeouts and rate limiting with robust provider factory ([#1187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1187))
