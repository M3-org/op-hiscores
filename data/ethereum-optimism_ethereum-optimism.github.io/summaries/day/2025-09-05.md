# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Sep 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in closing out issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature and addressing a long-standing request for `op-nat` integration in Kurtosis. Discussions also continued on making Superchain configurations fully explicit and handling large genesis files.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Min-Base-Fee Feature Implementation
Several issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature were closed, indicating progress in its implementation. This includes adding `minBaseFee` to the block header's `extraData` field ([#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/649)), adding an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3` ([#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/650)), and updating `eip1559.CalcBaseFee` to enforce the minimum if the feature is active ([#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/651)). All these closures were linked to the `op-geth` pull request [#666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/666).

### `op-nat` Integration in Kurtosis
The issue concerning running `op-nat` in Kurtosis was closed ([#158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/158)). The decision to close was based on a shift in prioritization towards other local development environments.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Superchain Configuration Explicit Definition
Discussion continued on making Superchain chain configurations fully explicit ([#763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/763)). The latest comment from @alfonso-op questioned whether chain configs are already self-descriptive, suggesting the possibility of closing the issue if that is the case.

### `op-geth` Initialization with Large Genesis Files
The issue regarding `op-geth` initialization with large genesis files and a LevelDB panic ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/668)) received a detailed response from @protolambda. The key points of the discussion include:
- The "alloc" part of `genesis.json` (Genesis-State-Spec) is optional and not strictly necessary to store in `geth`.
- It's recommended to modify `op-geth` for one-time state import by not storing the alloc data as a flat JSON blob and still importing the state into the DB.
- The `stateHash` attribute of the genesis block should be included in the chain-`config` part of `genesis.json` to allow fresh nodes to snap-sync state from bootstrap nodes.
- This approach mirrors how `op-mainnet` operates, avoiding embedding large genesis states directly into the `op-geth` binary.
- @cliff0412 acknowledged the reply, confirming they will not save the `genesis.json`.
