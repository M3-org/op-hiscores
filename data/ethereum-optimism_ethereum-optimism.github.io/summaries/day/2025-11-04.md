# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on expanding token support across various networks, with several new tokens added to the Optimism ecosystem. Discussions on active issues revolved around improving `proxyd`'s robustness against backend synchronization issues and optimizing blob priority fee tracking for `op-batcher/txmgr`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### New Token Listings
*   Added SYND token to the token list ([#1213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1213)).
*   Integrated VEE token into the Base network ([#1225](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1225)).
*   Included eUSD from ReserveProtocol on Base ([#1217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1217)).
*   Added the POLS token (Polkastarter v2) for ETH - Base ([#1229](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1229)).
*   Deployed rETH to the Ink network ([#1231](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1231)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Addressing `proxyd` Time Travel and Backend Synchronization
Discussions on [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/501) focused on preventing `proxyd` from returning outdated blocks when backends are out of sync. Proposed solutions include a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, where requests are fanned out to all backends, and the first successful response is returned. Another approach involves `proxyd` being aware of "block out of range" errors and silently falling back to other backends. IP-based and signature-based sticky sessions were also considered, with the latter requiring client-side changes. The primary concern is to prevent "backwards time travel" which could affect `eth_call`, `eth_estimateGas`, and `eth_feeHistory`.

### Optimizing Blob Priority Fee Tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr`
Issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102) addresses the need for better blob priority fee tracking. The current `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` RPC considers all past transactions, which may not be optimal for blob transactions. A suggestion was made to have the starting priority fee for new transactions "decay" from the previous transaction, rather than always resetting to a minimum, to improve handling of backlogs during busy periods. While this could be a quicker win, a more comprehensive blob priority fee tracker would provide better estimates from startup, though it represents a larger development effort.

### `op-acceptance-tests`: Flashblocks / Rbuilders Support
Issue [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16450) highlights that `sysgo` currently lacks awareness of flashblocks and rbuilders, preventing flashblocks-related tests from being run with the `sysgo` orchestrator. The latest comment indicates a desire to implement this to validate `kona-node` and `rollup-boost` changes.

### Updating `migrate` Method
Issue [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17743) tracks changes related to the `migrate` method. Recent comments clarify that this issue specifically covers OPCM changes, with devstack changes being tracked in a separate issue ([#17764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17764)). This suggests that the OPCM-related updates are progressing, potentially leading to the closure of this issue soon.
