# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on expanding token support across various networks, with several new tokens added to the token lists for Base and Ink. Discussions continued on active issues related to `op-acceptance-tests`, `proxyd` behavior, and blob priority fee tracking.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Token List Expansion
Several new tokens were added to the token lists, enhancing the platform's support for a wider range of assets.
- Added SYND token to the token list ([#1213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1213)).
- Integrated VEE token into the Base network's token list ([#1225](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1225)).
- Included eUSD from ReserveProtocol for the Base network ([#1217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1217)).
- Added the POLS token (Polkastarter v2) for ETH - Base ([#1229](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1229)).
- Deployed rETH to the Ink network ([#1231](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1231)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-acceptance-tests`: Flashblocks / Rbuilders Support
Discussion on [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16450) highlighted the need for `sysgo` to support flashblocks and rbuilders to enable related test execution. The latest comment indicates a desire to implement this to validate `kona-node` and `rollup-boost` changes.

### `op-batcher/txmgr`: Blob Priority Fee Tracking
On [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102), the conversation revolved around improving blob transaction priority fee estimation. The latest comment suggests that while a "decay" mechanism for starting priority fees could be a simpler quick win, a dedicated blob priority fee tracker would be a more comprehensive solution, albeit a larger undertaking. The current `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` RPC doesn't adequately account for blob transactions' separate priority fee dynamics.

### `proxyd`: Backwards Time Travel with Unsynced Backends
Issue [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/501) continues to be discussed, focusing on `proxyd` returning older blocks when backends are out of sync. The latest comments explore various approaches to mitigate this, including a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, error-aware fallback to other backends, and IP-based or signature-based sticky sessions. Concerns were raised about the impact of "backwards time travel" on other RPC methods like `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory`.
