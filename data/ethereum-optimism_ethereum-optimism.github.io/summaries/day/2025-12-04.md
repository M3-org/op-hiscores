### `op-node` Stuck in EL Sync Mode
Discussion continued on the issue where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart when Reth already has synced data ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18468)). The latest comment suggests a temporary fix: changing the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restarting the `op-node`. This issue is blocking a Base Mainnet node configured for execution layer syncing.
