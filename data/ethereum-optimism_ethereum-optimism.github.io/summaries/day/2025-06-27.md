# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Jun 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's activity focused on ongoing discussions and investigations into several key issues, particularly concerning `op-supervisor` behavior during resets and L1 origin validity, as well as CPU usage in `op-geth`. A new issue regarding a broken dependency in `op-chain-ops` was also opened.

## NEW ISSUES
### Dependency Management
A new issue [#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16612) was opened concerning a broken dependency `github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39` in `op-chain-ops`. The discussion highlights that `github.com/cosmos/go-bip39` is a fork, but `op` uses a newer version (`v1.1.0`) than the fork's latest (`v1.0.0`).

### Supervisor Event Spikes Investigation
An issue [#16603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16603) was opened to investigate spikes of `local-derived` and other events in `op-supervisor`. Initial speculation points towards a potential `ChainsDB` or `GlobalSyncExec` deadlock.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-supervisor` Reset Behavior and L1 Origin Validity
Discussions continued on issues related to `op-supervisor` reset behavior. In [#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16314), a comment noted that partial implementation for providing correct reset targets has been done in a related PR, but it still lacks handling for pre- and post-Interop differences and comprehensive L1 origin validity checks. Similarly, for [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16315), it was noted that while an L1 origin verifier method exists for local unsafe heads, it needs to be extended to safe heads to ensure canonical L1 origins for all reset targets. The issue [#16321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16321) also saw an update, indicating that while local unsafe head L1 origin validity is checked before sending `interop_reset`, other safety levels still lack this check, linking back to [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16315).

### Abnormal CPU Usage with `op-geth`
The issue [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/613) regarding abnormal CPU usage with `op-geth` v1.101511.0 received several new comments. A user requested instructions on how to generate pprof data to help diagnose the issue. Another user confirmed experiencing the same performance issue, noting that it might be related to an index update that took about 24 hours to complete. It was also suggested that the high CPU usage could be temporary due to log indexing rebuilding, a process introduced in the backported go-ethereum v1.15.11.
