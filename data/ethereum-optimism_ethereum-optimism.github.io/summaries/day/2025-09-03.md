## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon and Kona Integration
Discussions continued on integrating Cannon and Kona into the tooling for managing absolute prestates ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17283)). The latest comment suggests a format for `standard-prestates.toml` using `type = "cannon-kona"` and clarifies that the version number does not need to match `op-program`. Additionally, the OPCM support for Kona + Cannon is being verified ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17285)), with a recent comment highlighting the need to update the `OPContractsManager.sol` to support deploying the new game type.

### P2P Gossip Configuration Bug
An active discussion is ongoing regarding a bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values in `op-node/p2p/gossip` ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17308)). The latest comments discuss the implications of invalid zero values in the configuration and explore potential solutions, including a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to return a valid P2PConfig with sensible defaults. The issue was initially discovered due to panics in tests after a `go-libp2p-pubsub` dependency update.

### CircleCI Configuration Improvements
Discussions are progressing on improving the UX and testability of the CircleCI configuration ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17184)). Recent comments gather information on the highest value monorepo CI jobs to run locally, the friction caused by prerequisite setup steps, and the value of automating CircleCI config syntax validation. Ideas for dynamically sorting Go tests by run time to optimize local testing are also being explored.

### Sync Test Enhancements
The issue concerning sync tests using `op-sync-tester` and `op-acceptance-tests` was reopened ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16703)). The latest comment indicates that the issue was reopened because not every Hardfork transition was tested. Previous suggestions included testing all OP Stack HF transitions, using multiple CLs with a single Sync Tester, and incorporating user transactions in L2 blocks for syncing validation.

### Go 1.25 Compatibility for Cannon
The compatibility of Cannon with Go 1.25 is being tracked ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17060)). Go 1.25.1 has been released, but a recent comment notes that it does not appear to include a specific MIPS fix.

### Min Base Fee in PayloadAttributesV3
The issue to add an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3` is active ([#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/650)). A recent comment points to the relevant specs for the Jovian overview.

### Scripted Permissionless Devnet Spinup
The issue to script the permissionless devnet spinup process is being reviewed for closure ([#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/346)). A recent comment asks if the issue can be closed, indicating potential progress or resolution.
