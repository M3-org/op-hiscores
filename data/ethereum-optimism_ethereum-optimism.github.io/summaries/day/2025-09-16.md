# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Sep 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the opening of two new pull requests, focusing on adding token addresses for Celo and VLR. Discussions continued on existing issues, including a persistent test flakiness and a token bridging configuration query.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened today:
- A feature to add Celo network addresses for weETH and wstETH tokens was proposed ([#1204](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1204)).
- Another feature to add VLR was also opened ([#1205](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1205)).

### Addressing Test Flakiness
The issue of `TestPreNoInbox` flakiness in `op-acceptance-tests` continues to be a concern ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17298)). A recent attempt to fix the issue via `optimism/pull/17495` was unsuccessful, as confirmed by `pcw109550` on September 17th. Another flake was observed on September 16th, indicating the problem persists.

### Token Bridging Configuration Clarification
Discussion continued regarding a token bridging issue related to PR #1184 ([#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1203)). `AlexBHarley` suggested that the token at `0x431151F26c48B4D4BEFc34048a0966Bf960A0c50` on Base might not be an `OptimismMintableERC20`, which would explain the lack of a bridge address in the generated entry. Verification of the implementation was recommended to confirm this.

### Protocol Documentation Cleanup
Work is ongoing to clean up `protocol/system-config.md` ([#771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/771)). `joshklop` noted a suggestion from `sebastianst` to specify both the number and canonical name for config update enums (e.g., `MIN_BASE_FEE` and `6`). Additionally, linking to fork-specific specs for hard fork-added config updates is being considered.
