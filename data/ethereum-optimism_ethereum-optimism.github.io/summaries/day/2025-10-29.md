## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Addressing `dsl.EOA` Abuse in `op-devstack`
Discussions on [#18063](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18063) regarding race conditions in `op-devstack` due to `dsl.EOA` abuse continued. `ajsutton` emphasized that tests should use unique wallets funded by faucets to ensure isolation, as using the same EOA from parallel processes is problematic for nonces and balances. `joshklop` reflected on the limitations of parallelization for certain tests, while `pcw109550` suggested that `op-acceptor` might be used to manage external wallet objects for tests.

### `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` Marshalling Issues
Issue [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17907) concerning the marshalling of new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` saw new activity. `fakedev9999` announced a Jovian-ready release for Kona, while `emiliano-conduitxyz` reported a recurrence of the issue with a new field, highlighting the breaking changes for zk stacks and the need for better API versioning or expectations.

### Skipping L1 Chain Config for L3s
On [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18070), the ability for `op-node` and `op-program` to skip L1 chain config for L3s was discussed. `ajsutton` suggested detecting if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID to automatically apply L3 behavior, similar to how L1 mainnet and Sepolia are recognized.

### Upstreaming Celestia Batcher DA Size Fix
Issue [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17872) saw an update from `mslipper`, who opened a PR ([#18074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074)) to address the Celestia batcher DA size fix, noting it was a trivial task. This follows `sebastianst`'s review of the fix, which was deemed good.
