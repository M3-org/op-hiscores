# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Oct 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw new pull requests opened related to rETH deployments and logo updates. A new issue was created and closed quickly. Discussions continued on several active issues concerning L2 chain configurations, testing race conditions, and API stability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No completed work was reported for this period.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **rETH Deployment and Branding Updates:** Three new pull requests were opened, focusing on rETH. These include a deployment to soneium ([#1232](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1232)), an ink deployment ([#1231](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1231)), and an update to the rETH logo to reflect new branding ([#1230](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1230)).

## CLOSED ISSUES
- **Worldapp Issue Resolution:** A new issue titled "Worldapp" ([#1233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1233)) was created and subsequently closed on the same day.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported for this period.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Investigate upstreaming Celestia batcher DA size fix ([#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17872)):** The latest comment indicates that a pull request has been opened to address this issue, as it was a trivial fix.
- **Jovian: do not marshal new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17907)):** Discussions highlight that new fields being added to `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` are causing breakage for zk stacks like op-succinct and kailua, which rely on these configurations for commitment hashing. A new Kona release is available that is Jovian-ready. Concerns were raised about the impact of uncoordinated API changes on third-party integrations and the need for versioning or clearer expectations.
- **op-devstack: resolve race conditions arising from `dsl.EOA` abuse ([#18063](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18063)):** The latest comments emphasize that using the same EOA from multiple parallel processes is problematic due to nonce and balance effects. It was suggested that tests should fund new, unique wallets for complete isolation. The idea of a custom test runner and a master wallet object for EOA ownership was also discussed, with considerations for test parallelization limitations.
- **op-node,op-program: Ability to skip L1 chain config for L3s ([#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18070)):** The discussion suggests that the system should automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID and apply L3 behavior, similar to how L1 mainnet and Sepolia are recognized, to simplify the process for most L3s.
