## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Deprecation of Req-Resp P2P Sync in op-node
- Discussion on [#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/14108) continues regarding the removal of req-resp p2p sync in `op-node`. The latest comments highlight the benefits of an alternative unsafe block sync mechanism, emphasizing its cost-effectiveness, simpler networking (avoiding UDP and NAT issues), and faster scale-out and recovery compared to the current req-resp protocol. This alternative is described as complementary, allowing multiple "drivers" to gossip blocks, including a centralized one where the sequencer leader publishes the latest unsafe block via Redis.
