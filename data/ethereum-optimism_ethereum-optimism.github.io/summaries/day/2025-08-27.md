# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Aug 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing token validation robustness and expanding token listings. A critical bug fix was implemented to add retry logic for contract validation calls, improving contributor experience. New tokens, EL and Wrapped WIT, were added, alongside bwAJNA on Mode.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Token Listing Expansion
New tokens were added to the Superchain token list, expanding the ecosystem's supported assets. This includes the EL token added to Soneium ([#1190](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1190)), the Wrapped WIT token (beta) to multiple testnets ([#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1183)), and bwAJNA on Mode ([#1019](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1019)).

### Improved Token Validation Reliability
A significant bug fix was implemented to enhance the reliability of contract validation during CI. Retry logic was added for contract function calls (decimals, symbol, name) to address intermittent failures, improving the contributor experience for legitimate token submissions ([#1189](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1189)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Forge Deployer Migration Progress
Discussions on the Forge Deployer migration are active, with several issues seeing engagement. For the "Create CLI wrapper around Forge binary" issue ([#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17214)), `tooshiNoko` expressed interest in taking on the task. Similarly, `tooshiNoko` also inquired about taking on the conversion of `DeploySuperchain` ([#17215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17215)), `DeployImplementations` ([#17216](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17216)), `DeployOPChain` ([#17217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17217)), and contract verification logic ([#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17218)) to use Forge. On the main tracking issue for "OP Deployer Forge Migration" ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17213)), `tooshiNoko` noted that `bitwiseguy` had self-assigned and suggested syncing up to avoid overlapping work, mentioning a recently submitted PR (#17235) and expressing a desire to take on all related tasks if possible.
