## NEW ISSUES

### Supervisor L1 Origin Validity
A new issue was opened to improve the `op-supervisor`'s handling of L1 origin validity during resets. The current reset logic only checks for consistency between its local safe and the node's safe databases, but not whether the L1 origin of the target it finds is canonical. This could lead to issues where the supervisor relies on an invalid L1 origin after a reset. [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16315)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-supervisor: Fix ability to provide data for fault proofs with non-genesis interop
Discussions continued on how to enable `op-supervisor` to provide data for fault proofs with non-genesis interop. The core problem is that `op-challenger` currently doesn't fully support non-genesis interop upgrades, leading to invalid actions when proving the non-genesis activation block. A key point of discussion is whether the `op-challenger` should manually construct the root from rollup nodes or if the `op-supervisor` should handle this by indexing the safe DB from the first derived block it receives, even if pre-Interop. The latest comment suggests that allowing the `op-supervisor` to index pre-Interop data would also enable the removal of `op-node`'s safe DB for managed nodes.

### eth_getTransactionCount returns incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending txs
Users are reporting that `eth_getTransactionCount` is returning an incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending transactions, causing transactions to get stuck in the mempool. Users are actively seeking updates on this issue. [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/623)

### op-supervisor: Improve L1 origin validity handling during resets
This newly opened issue discusses improving the `op-supervisor`'s reset logic to ensure the L1 origin of the target found is canonical. The current logic only checks for consistency between local and node safe databases. There's a debate on whether the supervisor should perform walkbacks if an invalid L1 origin is found or if it should simply request another reset. The latest comment suggests that all targets provided by the supervisor should be valid, and if not, the supervisor should realize the L1 chain changed and provide a new reset target, reducing complexity.
