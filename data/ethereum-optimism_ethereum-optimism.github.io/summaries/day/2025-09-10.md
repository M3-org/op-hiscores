## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kurtosis Devnet Deprioritization
Several issues related to the Kurtosis devnet were closed as "won't implement" due to a change in development priorities. These include adding genesis checks to `optimism-package` ([#15753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15753)), extracting/mapping L1 chain config ([#15050](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15050)), adding a rotatory welcome message ([#15511](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15511)), investigating selective service selection ([#15537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15537)), and adding Kurtosis support to `op-validator` ([#16712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16712)). The umbrella issue for Kurtosis idempotency and performance ([#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/14390)) was also closed, as it was largely completed and Kurtosis is no longer a priority.

### Infrastructure Threat Modeling
An issue concerning infrastructure threat modeling related to flashblocks delivery ([#17144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17144)) was closed. The discussion concluded that while the process for building and delivering flashblocks container images needs improvement for reliability and security, it doesn't introduce novel risks beyond what's already accepted for other images. The best short-term mitigation is to hardcode image digests in Kubernetes deployment manifests.

### Dispute Game Implementation
An issue to use v2 dispute game implementations in `OPCM.addGameType` ([#17259](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17259)) was closed as a duplicate of another issue.

## NEW ISSUES

### Op-Program Enhancements
A new issue was opened to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program` ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17416)). This aims to provide key information before looking up a block hash by number.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis Reverse Proxy Websockets Support ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17194))
The issue, initially closed as "won't implement," was reopened due to an existing TODO in the code referencing it. The latest comment indicates that if the feature is no longer planned, the TODO should be removed.
