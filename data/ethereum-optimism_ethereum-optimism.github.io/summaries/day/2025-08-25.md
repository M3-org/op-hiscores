# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Aug 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on expanding token support within the Superchain ecosystem by adding the Pepe Community (PEPE) token for the Ethereum to Base bridge. Several long-standing issues, including those related to consensus event nonces, event tracing, logging, and test log visibility, were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Token Expansion
- The Pepe Community ($PEPE) token was added to the Superchain Token List, enabling bridging between Ethereum and Base. This involved updating `data/pepe_community/data.json` and adding `data/pepe_community/logo.svg`. ([#1188](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1188))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Consensus and Event System Refinements
- An issue tracking consensus-influencing event nonces was closed, as implementation is not planned for the time being. ([#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/13543))
- An issue concerning an event call graph for `op-service` was closed, as similar functionality exists elsewhere and the team is leaning towards removing the entire event system. ([#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16874))

### Logging and Debugging Improvements
- An issue related to cleaning up `op-up` logging was closed, deemed not worthwhile without `op-geth` eliminating global logger usage. ([#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17007))
- An issue regarding missing test logs in `op-acceptance-tests` was closed, as the logs were located in root logs. ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17151))

### Postmortem Documentation
- A postmortem issue for a Scalar fix was closed, indicating the task was completed during a recent retro. ([#17012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17012))
