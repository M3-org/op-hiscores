## CLOSED ISSUES

### Op-Up Challenger Support
The issue regarding `op-up` support for the challenger was closed today, with the conclusion that distributing the challenger within `op-up` for `sysgo` is likely not worth the effort, and focusing on other backends like Docker is preferred [#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17005).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerts
Discussions continued on setting up alerts for flashblocks. For [#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16867), an update was provided that an alert will be created once a related pull request in `rollup-boost` lands. Regarding [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16868), it was noted that peer count alerting for `op-node` sequencer peering already exists, and the focus will be on adding `reth`/`op-rbuilder` peer count alerts.

### Load Testing Flashblocks
Progress on load testing flashblocks on devnets was discussed in [#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16756). A team member accidentally marked the issue as done and is now working on a report summarizing the outcomes, including load test scenarios and network results.

### Sync Testing Enhancements
Discussions on `op-sync-tester` and `op-acceptance-tests` continued in [#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16703). New test case ideas were proposed, including checking every OP Stack Hard Fork transition, validating multiple CLs with a single sync tester, and testing user transactions within L2 blocks. It was noted that items 2 and 3 are captured in a separate issue.

### Op-Proposer Transaction Failure
A new comment was added to [#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/13502) confirming that setting `--game-type=1` fixed the "Failed to create a transaction" error for a user, aligning with previous suggestions to check and set the correct game type.
