## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node` Invalid Block Signature Discussion
Discussion continued on [#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17448) regarding an `op-node` invalid block signature error encountered during testnet deployment. A user reported experiencing the same problem and sought a solution.

### `proxyd` Backwards Time Travel Concerns
The issue [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/501), concerning `proxyd` potentially returning previous blocks as `unsafe` when backends are out of sync, saw further discussion. A contributor confirmed plans to focus on this issue from January 1st onwards, with no additional concerns raised by another team member. Previous discussions on this issue explored various approaches to mitigate the problem, including "multicall" strategies, `proxyd` awareness of "block out of range" errors, IP-based sticky sessions, and signature-based sticky sessions.
