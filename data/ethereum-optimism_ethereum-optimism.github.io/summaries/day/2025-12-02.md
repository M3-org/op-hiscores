## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-node` Invalid Block Signature Discussion
A user reported encountering an "op-node invalid block signature unrecognized signer" error while deploying on the testnet, seeking reasons for the issue. Another user, `lyh169`, commented on December 2nd, 2025, stating they have the same problem and are looking for a solution ([#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17448)).

### `proxyd` Backwards Time Travel Concerns
The issue describes how `proxyd` can return previous blocks as the `unsafe` block if its backends are not in sync, leading to "backwards time travel." On December 2nd, 2025, `yashvardhan-kukreja` provided an update, stating plans to focus on this issue from January 1st onwards. `joshklop` acknowledged the update, expressing appreciation and no additional concerns at the moment ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/501)).
