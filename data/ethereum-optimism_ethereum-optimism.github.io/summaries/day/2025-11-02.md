## ACTIVE ISSUES
A discussion is ongoing regarding [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102), which addresses "op-batcher/txmgr: Blob priority fee tracking". The core problem is that the current `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` RPC, used to determine the suggested priority fee, considers past transactions, which may not be optimal for blob transactions that have a separate priority fee mechanism. A recent comment from ajsutton suggests a potential "quick win" to improve transaction inclusion: allowing the starting priority fee for new transactions to "decay" from the previous transaction's fee, rather than always resetting to the minimum. This approach aims to handle backlogs more effectively during busy periods, though it's acknowledged as a less comprehensive solution.
