## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Blob Priority Fee Tracking Discussion
A discussion on [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102) regarding "op-batcher/txmgr: Blob priority fee tracking" included a new comment from ajsutton. The comment suggests a potential "quick win" for ensuring transaction inclusion by having the starting priority fee for new transactions "decay" from the previous transaction, rather than always resetting to the minimum. This approach aims to improve how the batcher handles backlogs during busy periods, even if it's not a comprehensive solution.
