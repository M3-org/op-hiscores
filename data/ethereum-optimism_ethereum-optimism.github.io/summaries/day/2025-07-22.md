# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Jul 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on expanding token support within the Superchain ecosystem by adding the QUICK token on Base. Additionally, significant progress was made in refining documentation, particularly the fault proof incident runbook, and addressing an issue related to configurable DA types for interop SuperSystem.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Ecosystem Expansion
- Added the $QUICK token on the Base chain, including an update to its logo, enhancing the range of supported assets within the Superchain. ([#1170](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1170))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation and Runbook Finalization
- The "Runbook v3 final review" issue was closed, with updates to references from other runbooks to point to V3. The three different versions of the runbook were renamed to indicate which releases they apply to (v1 = pre-OPCM; v2 = U14 & U15; v3 = U16+), and each now links to the others. ([#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16651))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interoperability and Data Availability Configuration
- The issue "op-e2e: Configurable DA type for interop SuperSystem" ([#15406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15406)) was briefly closed due to automation but has been reopened. The discussion revolves around the need for a batcher that posts using blobs rather than calldata for interop fault proof testing. While it was previously suggested that this might not block RC Beta due to existing test coverage for blob preimage, the issue remains active for future resolution, particularly before removing pre-interop fault proof support. The latest comment indicates an incorrect closure and subsequent reopening.
