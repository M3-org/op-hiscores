## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Reports
- Discussion continued on updating the `print_staging_report` script to be compatible with dispute-game v2 ([#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1148)).
    - The script needs to adapt to read game arguments from the `gameArgs` storage in the DGF, rather than the game implementation contract.
    - Concerns were raised about the script's assumption of only Permissioned and Permissionless games, as there will eventually be two permissionless games, potentially impacting the JSON output format.
