## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Report Script
Discussion on [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1148) revolves around updating the `print_staging_report` script to be compatible with Dispute Game v2. The script currently reads game arguments from the permissioned game implementation contract. The main challenge is adapting this to read from the `gameArgs` storage in the Dispute Game Framework (DGF) if available. There's also a concern that the script assumes only a Permissioned and Permissionless game, while the new system will have two permissionless games, which might impact the JSON output format.
