# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on adding a new token to the World Chain Sepolia testnet. Additionally, two significant issues related to `op-batcher` blob priority fee tracking and `op-node` sequencer recovery mode were closed after extensive discussion and investigation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Token Integration
A new token, AMIE, was added to the World Chain Sepolia testnet, including its details and logo. This expands the supported tokens within the ecosystem. ([#1243](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1243))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#1248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1248), was opened to add the Canonical SKL Deployment from Ethereum to Base.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking Resolution
The issue concerning `op-batcher/txmgr` blob priority fee tracking ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102)) was closed. Discussions highlighted that the blob tip oracle is now deployed to production, and the current `min blob cap` configuration value leads to overpaying compared to the oracle's suggestion. The oracle is currently informational but is expected to be utilized soon.

### Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug Fix
A potential bug in `op-node` sequencer recover mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18350)) was closed. The issue involved sequencer drift when recover mode was enabled during normal operation. The resolution involved refactoring the L1 origin code in `op-node` and adopting a fix to prevent errors when the L1 origin is up to tip.

## NEW ISSUES

### Artifact Extraction Path Discrepancy
A new bug report ([#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18663)) was opened regarding `ExtractFromFile()` in `op-deployer/pkg/deployer/artifacts/embedded.go`. The function expects an `out/` directory within the tarball, but the `mktar` tool packages artifacts with a `forge-artifacts/` prefix, causing issues with self-hosted `.tzst` artifacts.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102))
The latest comment confirms the deployment of the blob tip oracle to production. It notes that the current `min blob cap` of `4 gwei` results in overpayment, as the oracle suggests a priority fee of approximately `2.51 gwei`. The `op-batcher` logs a warning about the suggested blob tip cap being lower than the configured minimum. While currently informational, the oracle is expected to be used soon. Earlier discussions explored potential quick wins like decaying priority fees from previous transactions to handle backlogs more effectively.

### op-node sequencer recover mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18350))
The issue was closed after refactoring the L1 origin code in `op-node` and implementing a fix to prevent errors when the L1 origin is up to tip. Earlier discussions involved the sequencer requesting a non-existent L1 origin block when in recover mode during normal operation, leading to "not found" errors and violating the sequencer drift rule. A possible fix snippet was proposed to prevent temporary errors when recovery mode reaches the tip. The investigation also considered the influence of async L1 origin fetching.
