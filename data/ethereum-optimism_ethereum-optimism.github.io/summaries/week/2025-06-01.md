# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Jun 1 - 7, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the robustness and capabilities of the `op-supervisor`. A key new issue was opened to improve the supervisor's reset logic by ensuring L1 origin validity, sparking discussions on the best implementation path. Concurrently, active conversations continued around enabling the `op-supervisor` to provide data for fault proofs in non-genesis interop scenarios. While no code was merged, these deep architectural discussions are paving the way for future protocol security and interoperability enhancements. A persistent user-facing issue with `eth_getTransactionCount` also remains a point of focus.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided daily reports, no pull requests were merged this week. Development activity was focused on discussion and issue triage rather than code implementation.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week's activity was concentrated on defining new problems and advancing discussions on existing complex issues.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week according to the available reports.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`op-supervisor` Enhancements:** The primary focus was on the `op-supervisor`. A new issue, [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16315), was created to address a gap where the supervisor's reset logic does not verify if the L1 origin of its target is canonical. Ongoing discussion suggests favoring a simpler approach where the supervisor finds a new valid reset target rather than performing complex walkbacks.
    
    - **Fault Proofs & Interoperability:** Discussions continued on issue [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16166), which deals with enabling the `op-supervisor` to provide data for fault proofs involving non-genesis interop upgrades. The conversation is exploring a solution where the supervisor would index pre-Interop data, a change that could also simplify the architecture by removing the need for `op-node`'s safe DB in managed nodes.
    
    - **Pending Transaction Nonce Bug:** A critical user-facing issue, [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/623), remains active. Users continue to report that `eth_getTransactionCount` returns an incorrect nonce for pending transactions, causing them to become stuck in the mempool. The community is actively seeking updates and a resolution for this problem.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was characterized by in-depth technical discussions on core protocol components. The active debates on issues [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16315) and [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16166) highlight a collaborative effort to refine the `op-supervisor`'s design and ensure its security. Additionally, the ongoing reports and requests for updates on issue [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/623) demonstrate an active feedback loop between the project's users and the development team.
