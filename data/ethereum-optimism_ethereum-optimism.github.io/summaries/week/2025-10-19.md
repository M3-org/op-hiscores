# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on foundational discussions regarding protocol specifications and developer tooling, alongside minor network configuration updates. While direct code contributions were minimal, significant conversations took place concerning the implementation of the DA Footprint Limit, potential breaking changes in rollup configurations, and improving the local development experience. The primary completed work involved a data update for the Base network.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
This week saw a targeted update to network data.

- **Network Data Updates:** A new LSK address was added for the Base network, ensuring its configuration remains current ([#1210](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1210)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Discussions this week focused on unblocking future development and enhancing the developer environment. No issues were reported as closed during this period.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Developer Tooling:** A new issue ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17942)) was opened to enhance `op-up` as a tool for spinning up local devnets, aiming to replace the deprecated Kurtosis and streamline the development workflow.
    - **DA Footprint Limit:** The implementation of the DA Footprint Limit ([#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17551)) remains blocked by a spec derivation issue, highlighting a key dependency for protocol advancement.
    - **Rollup Configuration:** An active discussion on issue [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17907) is weighing the impact of marshalling new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig`. The conversation is focused on avoiding breaking changes for zk stacks, with suggestions to update related libraries like `op-succinct/kailua` as an alternative.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active issue discussions, which touched upon cross-ecosystem concerns and internal tooling improvements. The debate around rollup configuration changes ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17907)) demonstrates a careful consideration for compatibility with other projects, specifically zk stacks. Furthermore, the proposal to improve `op-up` ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17942)) reflects a community focus on improving the developer experience for contributors.
