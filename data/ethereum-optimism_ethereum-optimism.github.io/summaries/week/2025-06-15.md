# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on improving the stability and reliability of core protocol components. While only minor feature work was completed, significant diagnostic discussions took place around critical issues affecting `op-node` and `op-supervisor`, with new instrumentation proposed to better understand event overflows. The community also focused on enhancing the developer experience by clarifying tooling and advancing testing infrastructure. Meanwhile, ecosystem growth continued with the addition of new tokens to the registry.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This week saw targeted improvements to the ecosystem's token support.

- **Token Registry Expansion**: The Glyphs token was added to the Base token registry, expanding the range of supported tokens within the ecosystem ([#1159](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1159)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The majority of this week's activity involved investigating active issues and proposing new work. No issues were closed during this period.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Protocol Stability Investigation**: A primary focus was on diagnosing stability problems.
        - In issue [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16332), a user provided a detailed goroutine dump to help debug an `op-node` sync failure where nodes get stuck.
        - For the `op-supervisor` crash-loop ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16335)), a new PR was proposed to add a gauge for in-flight events, aiming to pinpoint the source of the event overflow.
    - **Developer Tooling & Experience**: Discussions continued on improving the developer environment.
        - Progress was made on persistent devnet testing ([#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/398)) with the addition of L1 Faucet support.
        - A discussion in [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/399) helped clarify the distinct use cases for `supersim` (for multichain application testing) versus Kurtosis devnets (for op-stack chain development).
        - The team is exploring better changelog automation for the release pipeline using tools like `git-cliff` ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16097)).
    - **New Proposals & Features**:
        - A new issue ([#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/725)) was opened to add missing Super DA error codes to the specification, particularly for reorg-related data availability errors.
        - Newly opened pull requests include adding support for BiLira (TRYB) ([#1165](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1165)), removing an obsolete project file ([#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1162)), and adding new content ([#1166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1166)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted the community's collaborative approach to problem-solving. The detailed user report in the `op-node` stability issue ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16332)) provided crucial data for debugging. Similarly, the active back-and-forth in the `op-supervisor` discussion ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16335)) demonstrates a collective effort to diagnose and resolve complex infrastructure challenges. These interactions underscore a healthy feedback loop between users and maintainers focused on strengthening the core protocol.
