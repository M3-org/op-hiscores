# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's focus was on expanding the Superchain ecosystem and refining development processes. The Superchain token list grew with the addition of several new assets, including PEPE, EL, and Wrapped WIT. A key improvement was made to the token validation CI, adding retry logic to enhance reliability for contributors. The team also engaged in significant backlog grooming, closing several long-standing issues related to deprioritized features and logging, thereby sharpening focus. Active discussions continued on major future work, including the migration of deployment tools to Forge, improvements to sync mechanisms, and the implementation of flashblock testing and monitoring.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on expanding token support and improving the contributor experience through more robust tooling.

- **Superchain Token List Expansion:** The ecosystem's supported assets were broadened with several new additions.
    - The Pepe Community ($PEPE) token was added for bridging between Ethereum and Base ([#1188](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1188)).
    - The EL token was added to Soneium ([#1190](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1190)).
    - The Wrapped WIT token (beta) was added to multiple testnets ([#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1183)).
    - The bwAJNA token was added on Mode ([#1019](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1019)).
    - A new pull request was opened to add the "fort token" ([#1193](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1193)).

- **Improved Contributor Tooling:** A bug fix was implemented to improve the reliability of the token submission process. Retry logic was added to contract validation calls in the CI pipeline, reducing intermittent failures for legitimate submissions ([#1189](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1189)).

- **Tokenomics Data Maintenance:** The circulating supply data was updated as part of routine maintenance ([#1192](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1192)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
This week saw the resolution of a key protocol specification and the closure of numerous deprioritized or resolved maintenance issues, alongside active planning for future development.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Protocol Specification:** The design document for `min-base-fee` was ratified, and the corresponding issue was closed, marking the completion of this specification ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/742)).
    - **Deprioritized Features:** Several issues were closed to reflect a shift in priorities, including consensus-influencing event nonces ([#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/13543)), an event call graph for `op-service` ([#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16874)), `op-up` support for the challenger ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17005)), and flashblocks support in Kurtosis ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16514)).
    - **Logging & Debugging:** Issues related to cleaning up `op-up` logging ([#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17007)) and locating missing test logs ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17151)) were resolved.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Forge Deployer Migration:** A significant discussion is underway to migrate deployment scripts to Forge. Contributor `tooshiNoko` has shown strong interest in taking on multiple related tasks ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17213), [#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17214), [#17215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17215), [#17216](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17216), [#17217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17217), [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17218)), indicating a major community-involved refactoring effort.
    - **Syncing Mechanisms:** A proposal to deprecate the req-resp P2P sync in `op-node` in favor of a simpler, more cost-effective unsafe block sync mechanism is being actively discussed ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/14108)). New test cases for `op-sync-tester` were also proposed ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16703)).
    - **Flashblocks:** Planning continues for flashblocks, with discussions on setting up monitoring and alerts ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16867), [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16868)), summarizing load test results ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16756)), and enabling tests on persistent devnets ([#17248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17248)).
    - **Documentation & CI:** A user contributed a significant overhaul to the OP Stack rollup deployment guide ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1530)), and a new CI strategy was proposed to periodically check for `op-geth` integration issues ([#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/665)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong community engagement and proactive contribution.
- User `krofax` submitted a comprehensive pull request to overhaul the OP Stack deployment documentation ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1530)), addressing a key pain point for new developers.
- Contributor `tooshiNoko` demonstrated significant initiative by expressing interest in tackling the entire suite of issues related to the Forge Deployer migration ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17213)), showcasing a desire from the community to take ownership of major refactoring efforts.
- The resolution of an `op-proposer` transaction failure for a user after they correctly set the game type ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/13502)) exemplifies effective community-driven support within issue threads.
