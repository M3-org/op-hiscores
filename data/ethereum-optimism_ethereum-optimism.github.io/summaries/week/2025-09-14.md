# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused heavily on expanding the Superchain ecosystem, with numerous new tokens added to the Base network and proposed for Celo. Alongside this growth, significant progress was made in maturing the protocol's foundations by closing issues related to tooling, system upgrades, and code refactoring. A key new discussion emerged around standardizing network upgrade transactions to improve robustness. A persistent challenge remains in resolving test flakiness within the `op-acceptance-tests`, which continues to be an active area of investigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on expanding the token ecosystem and improving token discoverability.

- **New Token Integrations:** The token list was expanded with several additions to the Base network, including FLIXX ([#1195](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1195)), MasterDEX Token (MDEX) ([#1196](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1196)), CANA Holdings California Carbon Credits ([#1197](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1197)), and ZKC ([#1198](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1198)).
- **Proposed Token Additions:** New pull requests were opened to add addresses for weETH and wstETH on Celo ([#1204](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1204)), as well as for VLR ([#1205](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1205)) and DOGE ([#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1206)).
- **Token Discoverability Fix:** The `nobridge` flag was removed for the ARCV2 token, ensuring its addresses and bridges are now discoverable ([#1202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1202)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of several technical debt and tooling issues, while new discussions began on protocol conventions and bug fixes.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Tooling & System Prep:** Several key infrastructure issues were closed, including the creation of a CLI wrapper for the Forge deployer ([#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17214)), preparation of `proxyd` for the Fusaka L1 activation ([#467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/467)), and a refactor of the dispute game creator pattern specs ([#17436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17436)).
    - **Analysis & Refactoring:** Work was completed on threat modeling for the DA Footprint Limit ([#336](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/336)), and an issue to consolidate redundant address structs was resolved ([#14977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/14977)).
    - **Testing & Evaluation:** Load testing for flashblocks ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16756)) and the evaluation of partner support criteria ([#16765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16765)) were concluded.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Standardizing Network Upgrades:** A significant new issue ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/781)) was opened to establish a more robust, collision-resistant convention for network upgrade transactions that deploy new contracts. The discussion immediately saw detailed technical proposals for using `CREATE2` to ensure safety.
    - **Persistent Test Flakiness:** The `TestPreNoInbox` test in `op-acceptance-tests` remains a blocker ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17298)), with a recent fix proving unsuccessful. The issue continues to be actively monitored.
    - **Token Configuration & Bugs:** A new issue was raised regarding a token not bridging correctly to Base, pointing to a potential configuration problem ([#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1203)). Another report flagged an incorrect address for ETH on Optimism-Sepolia ([#1201](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1201)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both initiating future protocol improvements and troubleshooting current issues. The new proposal to standardize network upgrade transactions ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/781)) sparked immediate and deep technical engagement, with `@protolambda` providing a detailed analysis on preventing address collisions. Similarly, the token bridging issue ([#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1203)) saw quick diagnostic feedback from `AlexBHarley`. The ongoing effort to resolve test flakiness ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17298)) also highlights persistent collaboration among contributors to stabilize the test suite.
