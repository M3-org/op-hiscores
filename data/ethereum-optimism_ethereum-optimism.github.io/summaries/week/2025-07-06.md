# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Jul 6 - 12, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on expanding the Superchain ecosystem and hardening core protocol components. A key feature was the integration of the Super token into Soneium, directly contributing to the project's goal of a growing, interoperable network. Concurrently, significant effort was dedicated to resolving complex technical issues, with active discussions surrounding `op-geth` performance, fault proof contract implementation, and the fundamental behavior of precompile addresses in the OP Stack. This blend of new development and deep-dive maintenance underscores a focus on both growth and stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development this week was focused on ecosystem growth.

- **Superchain Ecosystem Expansion:** A new feature was merged to integrate the Super token into Soneium ([#1171](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1171)). This integration enhances the utility and interoperability of assets within the Superchain.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of several items related to testing and prioritization, while new and ongoing discussions highlighted a focus on protocol security and performance.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Test Reliability & Prioritization:** An issue concerning the reliability of acceptance tests was closed, marking an improvement in test suite stability ([#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16378)). An `op-batcher` configuration issue was closed due to inactivity ([#15355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15355)), and a feature to add a pre-Interop logic mode to `op-node` was deprioritized and closed ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16520)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Fault Proofs:** A new issue was opened to finalize the v3 fault proof incident runbook, moving it from "draft" to a production-ready state ([#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16651)). Discussions are also actively progressing on the `Fault Proof creator contract OPCM changes` ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15789)), with a detailed checklist of action items under review.
    - **`op-geth` Performance:** The investigation into abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/613)) continues, with contributors providing performance profiles. The leading theory suggests the high usage may be temporary, caused by index rebuilding after a recent update, though concerns about release quality assurance persist.
    - **Protocol Clarifications:** A discussion on precompile address initialization ([#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16620)) received a key clarification: the 1 wei balance is intentionally set to prevent these addresses from being treated as empty accounts due to "obscure rules."

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions on several key issues. The `op-geth` performance issue ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/613)) saw multiple community members like `PierrickGT`, `jsvisa`, and `cpuchainorg` contributing diagnostic data and analysis. In the discussion on `TestCrossSafeUpdate` ([#16548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16548)), contributor `DeVikingMark` proactively created a pull request to address the issue. Furthermore, core team member `tynes` provided a valuable clarification on a fundamental protocol mechanism in issue [#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16620), demonstrating healthy interaction between the core team and the broader community.
