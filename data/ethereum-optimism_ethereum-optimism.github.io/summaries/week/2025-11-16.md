# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity focused on expanding the ecosystem's token support while also addressing key operational and architectural challenges. A new token was successfully added to the Base deployment, and a critical runbook was created to mitigate potential batcher throughput issues. Concurrently, an important issue related to migrating contract verification tooling was resolved, and a significant architectural discussion progressed concerning the flexibility of the fault dispute game system.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on managing the official token list for chains in the ecosystem.

- **New Token Integration:** The `MR_LIGHTSPEED` token was added to the Base deployment. This integration, completed in PR [#1237], includes the token's SVG logo and metadata, configured with `nobridge: true` and an overridden on-chain name to display as "Mr Lightspeed Creator Coin".
- **Pending Token Additions:** The pipeline for new tokens continues to be active, with new pull requests opened to add the BOB token ([#1239]) and SHIB ([#1240]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved closing out completed tasks and continuing discussions on core protocol design.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Operational Runbook:** An issue ([#16959]) was closed with the creation of a runbook to address low batcher throughput caused by an improperly configured `min-base-fee`. This provides clear steps for incident response.
    - **Tooling Migration:** The task to convert contract verification logic to use Forge ([#17218]) was closed, as the work was completed in a separate pull request ([#14813]), marking a successful tooling upgrade.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this week.
    - A key discussion continued in [#18347] regarding the `AnchorStateRegistry`'s dependency on `IFaultDisputeGame`. The conversation focuses on how to refactor this dependency to support a wider variety of dispute game types, with proposals including expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface. This reflects ongoing efforts to enhance the protocol's modularity and future-proofing.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Development activity indicates a dual focus on routine ecosystem maintenance and deep protocol-level architecture. The steady stream of pull requests for token additions suggests a well-defined process for community or partner integrations. Meanwhile, the detailed technical discussion on active issue [#18347] highlights ongoing collaboration among core developers to refine the foundational components of the fault dispute system.
