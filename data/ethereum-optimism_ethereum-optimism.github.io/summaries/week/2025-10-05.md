# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts focused on protocol maintenance and enhancing the robustness of monitoring tools. While no major features were completed, a critical discussion progressed on improving how the dispute monitor (`op-dispute-mon`) handles out-of-sync nodes, aiming to prevent false alerts and increase system reliability. Additionally, a routine but necessary pull request was opened to update a migrated token address, ensuring contract interactions remain accurate.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
No pull requests were merged during this period. However, work was initiated on necessary maintenance:

*   **Token Address Maintenance:** A pull request ([#1219](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1219)) was opened to update the WGC token address. This change is required following the token's migration and the LZ OFT upgrade from April 2025.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened and no existing issues were closed this week. The primary focus was on an ongoing discussion regarding a key monitoring component.

*   **New & Active Issues:** The most significant activity centered on issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17814), which addresses a problem where `op-dispute-mon` incorrectly detects a disagreement when one of its configured rollup RPCs is lagging. The discussion evolved from an initial proposal of using `syncStatus` to a more robust solution: checking if a node has processed the specific L1 block where a dispute game was created. This approach would more accurately determine if a node is sufficiently in sync to provide valid state information. A resolution is partially dependent on a related pull request ([#17819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/17819)) which is expected to mitigate some of the underlying problems.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The collaborative focus this week was evident in the detailed technical discussion on issue [#17814]. The conversation showcased a thorough problem-solving process, with contributors proposing, challenging, and refining solutions to improve the dispute monitor's logic. This highlights the community's commitment to ensuring the security and reliability of the core protocol infrastructure.
