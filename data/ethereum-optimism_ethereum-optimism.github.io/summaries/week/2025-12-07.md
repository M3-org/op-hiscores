# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on routine maintenance and advancing discussions on key technical improvements. The project saw multiple updates to the circulating supply data, ensuring tokenomics information remains accurate. Concurrently, significant progress was made in planning future work, with community members stepping up to tackle important issues. Discussions advanced on simplifying the batcher by removing legacy Pectra fork logic and on implementing a new health check for `op-rbuilder` to enhance replica reliability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on maintaining accurate on-chain data, with no new features or major refactors merged.

- **Tokenomics Data Maintenance**
  A routine update to the `circulatingSupply.txt` file was merged in [#1246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1246) to reflect the latest data. This ongoing maintenance task also saw two new pull requests, [#1244](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1244) and [#1245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1245), opened for the same purpose, highlighting the continuous effort to keep financial information current.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed this week. However, discussions on active issues signaled progress on future development priorities.

- **Closed Issues:**
  No issues were closed during this period.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Batcher Simplification ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18479)):** Discussion continued on simplifying the batcher by removing the `isPectra` check, as the Pectra L1 fork is now established. Contributor `Himess` received confirmation from `geoknee` to proceed with the changes, which will streamline the codebase by removing legacy conditional logic.
  - **`op-rbuilder` Healthcheck ([#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17685)):** This issue, which addresses the need for a dedicated `replica-healthcheck` for `op-rbuilder` to ensure it stays in sync with `op-geth`, saw renewed community interest. Contributor `Himess` inquired about taking on the task, indicating that this important reliability improvement may soon be underway.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was a key theme this week, with contributors actively participating in discussions to drive technical improvements. The contributor `Himess` showed initiative by engaging with two separate high-priority issues, first receiving a green light to work on the batcher simplification ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18479)) and then volunteering to tackle the `op-rbuilder` health check ([#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17685)). This demonstrates a healthy collaborative environment where community members are empowered to contribute to the core protocol.
