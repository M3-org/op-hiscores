# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on routine maintenance and planning for future protocol enhancements. The primary completed work involved updates to the circulating supply data, ensuring tokenomics information remains accurate. Concurrently, discussions on active issues signaled progress on key technical initiatives, including a plan to simplify the batcher by removing legacy code related to the Pectra fork and a proposal to add a new health check for `op-rbuilder` to improve replica stability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The focus of completed work this week was on maintaining accurate tokenomics data for the ecosystem.

- **Tokenomics Data Maintenance:** The `circulatingSupply.txt` file was updated via pull request [#1246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1246). This appears to be a regular task, as two new pull requests, [#1244](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1244) and [#1245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1245), were also opened for the same purpose.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened and no existing issues were closed this week. However, discussions on active issues have paved the way for future development work.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.
- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Batcher Simplification:** On issue [#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18479), discussion continued regarding the removal of `isPectra` logic from the batcher. As the Pectra L1 fork is now in the past, this change would simplify the codebase. Contributor `Himess` received confirmation to proceed with the implementation.
    - **`op-rbuilder` Health Check:** In issue [#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17685), which proposes a `replica-healthcheck` for `op-rbuilder` to prevent divergence from `op-geth`, contributor `Himess` volunteered to take on the task, indicating potential movement on this reliability improvement.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident through proactive discussions on GitHub issues. Contributor `Himess` was active, both receiving a green light from `geoknee` to proceed with the batcher simplification ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18479)) and volunteering to take ownership of the `op-rbuilder` health check task ([#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17685)). This highlights a healthy dynamic of contributors identifying and taking initiative on important future work.
