# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing protocol stability and security through rigorous testing and issue diagnosis. While development included a tangible improvement to data integrity testing, the primary focus was on collaborative deep dives into critical issues. Discussions addressed an `OptimismPortal2` fuzzing failure, `op-challenger` panics on older L1 clients, and P2P connection flakiness between different node implementations. This period was characterized by intensive problem-solving and hardening of the existing system.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving the reliability of data consumed by ecosystem tools.

- **Data Integrity Testing:** A new test was introduced to validate the existence and format of the circulating supply file. This enhancement ensures the integrity of a key data source for dashboards and external services, preventing potential display errors or miscalculations ([#1247](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1247)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No issues were reported as closed this week. The majority of activity was concentrated on diagnosing and discussing several high-priority active issues.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Critical Bridge & Challenger Bugs:** A significant fuzzing test failure was identified in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when handling deposits to a null address, pointing to a critical logic error that needs immediate attention ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18554)). Separately, a `nil pointer dereference` panic in `op-challenger` was diagnosed as occurring when connected to an L1 client that is not Dencun-upgraded and lacks `blobBaseFee` support ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18608)).
    - **Node Interoperability and Syncing:** P2P connection flakiness in system tests between `op-geth` and `op-reth` nodes was flagged as a high-priority issue impacting test stability and potentially production compatibility ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18570)). Relatedly, discussions continued around node synchronization failures presenting as "missing trie node" errors, which are suspected to originate from the L1 Execution Client failing to provide state data ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18581)).
    - **Protocol Design & Performance:** A debate is ongoing regarding the design of interop replacement transactions, weighing protocol simplification against the explicit needs of the fault proof system ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18574)). For ZK Proofs, the need to offload expensive operations like `keccak` to the host in the `kona-sp1` program was highlighted as critical for performance ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18533)).
    - **Release Coordination:** The finalization of Upgrade 18 releases is being tracked, currently pending governance approval for `op-program` and a final check for critical issues on testnets ([#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18548)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week saw strong collaborative efforts focused on diagnosing complex technical issues. Contributors `rdin777` and `ajsutton` were central to many discussions, driving the triage of bugs and providing detailed technical analysis across multiple issues. There was also active participation from the community, such as user `lyh169` providing key details that helped diagnose the `op-challenger` panic. The active dialogue on issues like interop transaction design ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18574)) demonstrates a healthy, engaged process for debating core protocol mechanics.
