# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts were heavily focused on protocol stability and correctness, with significant attention dedicated to investigating critical bugs across the stack. While development saw the addition of new data integrity tests for circulating supply data, the primary activity centered on triaging and diagnosing complex issues. Active discussions addressed a `nil pointer dereference` in `op-challenger`, a critical fuzzing failure in `OptimismPortal2`, and P2P connection flakiness between client implementations. These investigations underscore a commitment to hardening the core infrastructure and ensuring system reliability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Progress this week centered on improving the reliability of data consumed by ecosystem tools.

- **Enhanced Data Integrity Testing:** To ensure the accuracy of dashboards and other data consumers, a new test was added to validate the circulating supply file. This check verifies the file's existence and confirms its content is a single positive number, preventing data corruption issues ([#1247](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1247)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue triage was a major focus, with several critical discussions progressing on bugs affecting core components, node stability, and protocol design.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Critical Bug Investigations:** Several high-priority bugs are under active investigation.
        - A `nil pointer dereference` in `op-challenger` ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18608)) was identified as occurring when the L1 chain does not support blob transactions, pointing to an issue with handling uninitialized fields.
        - A critical fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18554)) when depositing to `address(0)` is being prioritized due to its potential impact on deposit handling logic.
        - P2P connection flakiness between `op-reth` and `op-geth` nodes in system tests ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18570)) is being treated as a major bug affecting test environment stability.
    - **Node Synchronization Problems:** Multiple users reported node synchronization failures with "missing trie node" errors ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18581)), particularly when using `op-geth` and Publicnode snapshots. The issue appears related to the L1 Execution Client failing to provide necessary state data.
    - **Protocol & Performance Discussions:**
        - A design discussion is ongoing regarding the necessity of injecting replacement block transactions for the fault proof system ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18574)), with debate on whether the Supernode could provide the required data more simply.
        - Efforts to optimize `kona-sp1` continue, with a focus on ensuring expensive operations like `keccak` are correctly offloaded to the host for performance gains ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18533)).
    - **Release Coordination:** Blockers for the upcoming Upgrade 18 release are being tracked in [#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18548), awaiting governance approval for `op-program` and final confirmation from testnet runs.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong collaboration between maintainers and the community in diagnosing complex issues. Contributors `rdin777` and `ajsutton` were central figures in driving discussions and requesting detailed information across numerous high-priority issues. There was active participation from users like `lyh169`, `tsulhc`, `yaki-1337`, and `bayardar`, who provided critical logs and configuration details that are essential for debugging issues related to node synchronization and client compatibility. This interactive troubleshooting process demonstrates a healthy feedback loop between the core team and the broader ecosystem of node operators.
