# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Jun 8 - 14, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on maintaining the health and expanding the reach of the Optimism token list. A critical bug affecting the `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` npm package was resolved, restoring proper functionality for developers relying on it. Concurrently, the ecosystem's asset support was broadened with the addition of BTREE and Bridged EURC tokens. Behind the scenes, significant discussion continued on improving CI and test reliability, with the development of a new "Flakiness Report" to better diagnose and address sources of instability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on bug fixes and data additions for the project's token list, directly impacting developers and users within the Superchain ecosystem.

### Token List Maintenance and Expansion
A critical bug was fixed in the `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` npm package, which was missing its `dist` directory in recent versions, causing import errors. This fix ensures the package is usable again for developers ([#1161](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1161)). In addition to this maintenance, the list of supported assets was expanded:
- **BTREE** token addresses were added for both Optimism and Optimism-Sepolia ([#1143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1143)).
- **Bridged EURC** was added to the Lisk network ([#1157](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1157)), enhancing cross-chain asset availability.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was focused on resolving a critical package failure and continuing the strategic push to improve testing infrastructure.

- **Closed Issues:** A key issue ([#1146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1146)) was closed following the resolution of a bug where the `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` package was published without its necessary `dist` directory.

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened this week. However, active discussions continued on improving developer infrastructure:
    - **CI Flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16271)):** A "Flakiness Report" generator was released and iterated upon to provide better visibility into CI failures, now including job names to help pinpoint problematic backends.
    - **Acceptance Test Reliability ([#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16378)):** The conversation highlighted the need to measure flakiness by package rather than by individual test, as tests within the same package can interfere with one another. The new flakiness report is expected to provide valuable data for this effort.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
While there were no newly opened pull requests to showcase broad community interaction, significant collaborative problem-solving was evident in the ongoing discussions around CI and test stability ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16271), [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16378)). The creation and refinement of a "Flakiness Report" generator demonstrates a focused, collaborative effort by team members to improve the project's internal tooling and overall reliability.
