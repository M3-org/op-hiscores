# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Jun 29 - 5, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This was a quiet week for the project, characterized by minor maintenance and data updates. The primary activities involved adding a new token, CO, to the repository's dataset and closing an older issue related to the `op-deployer` tool. Overall, the week's progress reflects routine upkeep rather than new feature development or major bug fixes.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Activity was light, with one notable update to the project's token data.

### Token Data Management
- The CO token was added to the repository's data. This update included its corresponding `logo.svg` and an update to `data.json` to incorporate the new asset ([#1169](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1169)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management was minimal, focusing on closing a resolved bug report.

  - A bug report for `op-deployer v0.4.0-rc.2` was closed ([#16618](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16618)). The issue, which caused an error when running with `standard-overrides`, was resolved as the fix had already been implemented in a more recent release candidate.
