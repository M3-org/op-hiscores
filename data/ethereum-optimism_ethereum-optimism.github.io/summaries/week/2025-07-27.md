# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on expanding the Superchain ecosystem and advancing core protocol specifications. The Superchain token list was updated to include the TOWNS token, enhancing interoperability. Development continued with new pull requests to add the PEPE Community token and introduce support for tBTC on the Sepolia testnet. Meanwhile, significant discussion took place around the "Min Base Fee" feature, with progress on implementation drafts and a focus on thoroughly documenting its impact on state growth for the official specification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on growing the list of assets available within the Superchain.

- **Superchain Token List Expansion**
  - In support of a more interconnected ecosystem, the TOWNS token was added to the Superchain token list. The update in [#1178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1178) includes the token's details and contract addresses for both the Ethereum and Base chains.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Discussions this week were concentrated on the specification for the "Min Base Fee" and the submission of new pull requests for token and feature additions.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.
- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were opened.
  - **"Min Base Fee" Specification:** Discussions continued across issues [#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16807) and [#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/742). An early `reth` draft is under review to gather feedback, and work is underway to compute a rough estimate of the state growth implied by the feature. This estimate is intended for the specification's motivation section, highlighting a commitment to thorough documentation.
  - **New Pull Requests:** Two new feature pull requests were opened, representing upcoming additions:
    - [#1179](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1179): Proposes adding support or documentation for tBTC on the Sepolia testnet.
    - [#1180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1180): Adds the PEPE Community (PEPE) token to the token list.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
