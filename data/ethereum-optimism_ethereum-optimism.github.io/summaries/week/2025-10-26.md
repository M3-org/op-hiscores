# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on expanding the Superchain ecosystem and addressing key interoperability challenges. Progress was made by adding ENSC for Lisk to the Superchain Token List, enhancing the network's asset diversity. Concurrently, new work began to deploy rETH across multiple chains. Significant discussions emerged around improving the OP Stack for third-party and L3 integrations, with active problem-solving on issues related to data availability, configuration compatibility, and testing stability. These conversations highlight a focus on maturing the stack to support a growing and diverse ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The primary completed work this week focused on expanding the assets available on the Superchain.

- **Superchain Token List Expansion:** The token list was updated to include ENSC for both Lisk and Lisk Sepolia. This change adds the token's symbol, decimals, and respective chain addresses, broadening the range of recognized assets within the ecosystem ([#1223](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1223)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving testing and application-specific problems while engaging in deep discussions on architectural improvements for L3s and third-party developers.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - An issue regarding the need for more end-to-end testing in `op-deployer` was closed, acknowledging the recent addition of new CLI-level integration tests that strengthen the deployment pipeline ([#16842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16842)).
    - A new issue concerning "Worldapp" was opened and closed on the same day, indicating a swift resolution ([#1233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1233)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    Discussions this week focused on improving compatibility and stability for ecosystem partners:
    - **Third-Party & L3 Compatibility:** Several active issues highlight challenges faced by developers building on the OP Stack. A discussion is underway on how to handle breaking changes in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` that are affecting zk stacks ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17907)). Another key topic is the need to allow L3s to skip L1 chain configuration, which is currently a blocker for L3 development ([#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18070)).
    - **Data Availability:** Progress is being made on integrating a fix from Celestia for a batcher data availability size issue, with a PR now open for review ([#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17872)).
    - **Test Stability:** An issue was raised concerning race conditions in `op-devstack` acceptance tests caused by shared wallets (`dsl.EOA`). The proposed solution is to ensure tests use unique, isolated wallets to improve reliability ([#18063](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18063)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week's activity showcased strong collaboration with the broader ecosystem. The discussion around a Celestia-developed fix for a data availability issue ([#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17872)) is a clear example of cross-project cooperation. Furthermore, active engagement on issue [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17907) demonstrates a responsive feedback loop with third-party integrators like `kailua` and `succinct`, who reported breaking changes and sparked a conversation about the need for better API versioning or integration strategies.
