# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on maintenance and planning rather than new feature deployment. The primary focus was on issue backlog management, with several long-standing issues related to sequencer stability and node operations being closed. A significant new initiative was proposed to migrate block explorer references from Etherscan to Blockscout for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia. While no code was merged, a new pull request was opened to add DGOLD tokens, indicating ongoing token additions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No pull requests were merged during the reporting period. However, work was initiated on a new token addition:

*   **New Token Proposal:** A pull request ([#1174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1174)) was opened to add DGOLD tokens to the project.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on cleaning up the backlog and initiating a key infrastructure migration.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Sequencer and Node Stability:** A number of older issues concerning sequencer and node health were closed, including recovery from a sequence window expiration ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/11228)), sequencer halting ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/12240)), and node startup problems ([#15411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15411)). These closures suggest the issues are either resolved or no longer considered relevant.
    *   **Dependency and Test Management:** An issue regarding an outdated NPM package ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/13459)) was closed with the clarification that NPM packages are no longer being updated. A test porting task ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/413)) was also closed, as its implementation was completed in a separate pull request.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Block Explorer Migration:** A new issue ([#1175](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1175)) was opened to track the migration from Etherscan to Blockscout for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia. Active discussion on a related issue ([#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1696)) points to a pull request in the `docs` repository that is awaiting review, indicating this effort is underway.
    *   **Test Porting:** An update on issue [#416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/416) confirmed that the porting of `TestPectra` to devstack has been implemented in a pull request within the main `optimism` repository.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was characterized by cross-repository coordination. The discussions and updates around the Blockscout migration ([#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1696)) and test porting efforts ([#416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/416)) highlight that this repository is used to track and coordinate work that spans the broader Optimism ecosystem, including the `docs` and `optimism` repositories.
