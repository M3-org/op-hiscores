# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a dual focus on completing major initiatives and launching deep investigations into performance and protocol behavior. A significant push to refine Superchain-Ops tooling culminated in the closure of numerous issues, enhancing CI performance, task management, and user experience. Concurrently, the team made key progress by completing acceptance tests for Flashblocks integration. The latter half of the week shifted towards investigation, with active discussions and analysis centered on `op-batcher` memory consumption, abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth`, and the correctness of `op-supervisor` reset logic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on finalizing tooling for the Superchain and improving developer environments.

- **Superchain-Ops Tooling Refinements:** A substantial effort to improve the Superchain-Ops framework was completed, resolving a large number of issues. Key enhancements include:
    - **CI and Testing:** The `template_regression_tests` CI job was made faster ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/648)), and tests were updated to use the latest `contracts-bedrock` tools ([#605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/605)).
    - **Task Management:** The system now supports "stacked" proposals with incrementing nonces ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/342)) and provides a simpler UX for overriding nonces ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/770)).
    - **Architecture & UX:** The `MultisigTask` architecture was revisited ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/636)), and state diffs are now printed in a more readable markdown format ([#777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/777)).

- **Flashblocks Integration:** Progress was made on network performance and reliability with the completion of tasks to enable flashblocks on `eris-0` and the successful implementation of acceptance tests for flashblock transactions.

- **Developer Experience:** Local development was made easier with an update to Supersim, which now allows for the modification of the `L2toL2CDM` predeploy for testing purposes.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of a major tooling epic, while new investigations into performance and protocol correctness became a primary focus.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - A significant number of issues related to the **Superchain-Ops tooling** were closed, marking the completion of a major refinement effort across simulation, CI, task management, and documentation ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/448), [#600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/600), [#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/337), and others).
    - Tasks for **Flashblocks deployment and acceptance testing** were successfully closed.
    - A spike to explore **CI Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16437)) was closed with the decision not to implement them at this time, favoring a focus on addressing flaky tests directly.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Performance Investigations:** Several critical performance issues are under active investigation:
        - **`op-batcher` Memory Consumption:** A spike ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16537)) identified the compressor as the primary source of high memory usage, with work now focused on optimization. A related issue ([#16572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16572)) was opened to improve memory observability using `pprof` in CI.
        - **`op-geth` CPU Usage:** Multiple users reported abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` v1.101511.0 ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/613)). The leading theory is that it's related to a one-time log indexing rebuild, but investigation continues with community-provided data.
    - **`op-supervisor` Correctness:** A series of related issues ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16314), [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16315), [#16321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16321)) saw continued discussion around ensuring the validity of L1 origins during reset events. A new issue ([#16603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16603)) was opened to investigate event spikes, pointing to a potential deadlock.
    - **Dependency Management:** A new issue ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16612)) was opened to address a broken `go-bip39` dependency in `op-chain-ops`.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
- **Active Issue Triage:** The `op-geth` CPU usage issue ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/613)) demonstrated strong collaboration, with multiple users confirming the problem and maintainers providing diagnostic instructions to help gather `pprof` data.
- **New Contributor Interest:** Issue [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/781), aimed at reducing noisy terminal output, attracted interest from new contributors `JoseValperga` and `nsancheznez`, who offered to work on the improvement.
- **Tooling Clarification:** Ongoing discussions in issue [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/399) helped clarify the distinct use cases for Supersim (dapp testing) versus the interop Kurtosis devnet (chain development), improving knowledge sharing within the community.
- **Internal Coordination:** The completion of training calls for internal stakeholders ([#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/514)) highlights the coordinated rollout of the newly refined Superchain-Ops tooling.
