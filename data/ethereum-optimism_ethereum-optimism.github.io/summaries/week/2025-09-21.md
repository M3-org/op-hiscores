# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Sep 21 - 27, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by a dual focus on administrative cleanup and strategic ecosystem growth. A significant number of legacy issues related to the `superchain-ops` architecture were closed, reflecting progress and shifts in design rather than new code merges. In parallel, development efforts concentrated on expanding the Superchain's reach by integrating new chains and tokens, including the Celo-Sepolia testnet and several new assets on Base and Optimism. A key theme that emerged was the refinement of developer experience, highlighted by a detailed feedback report on the `superchain-ops` flow, which sparked active discussion and immediate action.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on expanding the ecosystem's supported assets and maintaining project dependencies.

- **Ecosystem Expansion: New Chains and Tokens**
  - The Celo-Sepolia testnet and its corresponding WETH token were added to the ecosystem ([#1199](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1199)).
  - Support for new tokens was introduced, including the IncomRWA (iRWA) token on the Base Network ([#1200](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1200)) and the LITKEY token for both Optimism and Base, with Sepolia support ([#1214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1214)).
  - The address for the Wrapped WIT token on Sepolia was updated ([#1211](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1211)).

- **Dependency Management**
  - The `eslint-plugin-unicorn` dependency was updated from version 42.0.0 to 44.0.2, ensuring the project benefits from the latest linting rules and improvements ([#1092](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1092)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  A major cleanup effort resulted in the closure of 17 long-standing issues, primarily related to the `superchain-ops` framework. This reflects the finalization of architectural decisions and implementation shifts. Key areas addressed include:
  - **Architecture Refinements:** Issues concerning `SignFromJson` compatibility ([#49](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/49)), JSON parsing cleanup ([#12](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/12)), and refactoring of `VerificationBase` ([#427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/427)) and `AccountAccessParser` ([#666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/666)) were closed.
  - **Developer Experience & Tooling:** Improvements such as better proposal operations ([#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/140)) and task tracking ([#433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/433)) were resolved.
  - **Simulation and Testing:** A batch of issues related to proposal simulation ([#436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/436]), security council rehearsals ([#529](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/529)), and various simulation tasks were closed.
  - **CI Stability:** Issues related to CI rate limiting ([#569](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/569), [#628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/628)) and Foundry test failures ([#577](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/577)) were resolved.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **`superchain-ops` Developer Experience:** The most significant new issue, [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1224), provided a detailed "snag report" on the improved `superchain-ops` flow. The report highlighted points of confusion for users during the signing process, including the purpose of 'TODOs' in simulation output and the necessity of `op-txverify`. The issue generated immediate and detailed discussion, with a pull request already opened to address some of the feedback.
  - **Fusaka L1 Activation:** Discussion continued in [#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17472) on preparing the `op-batcher` for the upcoming Fusaka L1 activation, specifically its need to send blob transactions with cell proofs.
  - **Code Quality and Refinements:** Several new issues were opened to track minor but important code quality improvements, such as splitting test assertions ([#17598](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17598)), adding helper functions ([#17600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17600)), and deduplicating Engine API validation logic ([#688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/688)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted a strong feedback loop within the community. The detailed report and subsequent discussion in issue [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1224) demonstrated constructive collaboration between users experiencing friction (`geoknee`) and maintainers (`blmalone`), who provided thorough explanations and prompt fixes. This interaction is crucial for refining the developer experience of core tooling like `superchain-ops`. Additionally, proactive planning for the Fusaka upgrade in [#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17472) and collaborative discussions on code quality improvements between `smartcontracts` and `hexshire` show a healthy and engaged contributor base focused on both immediate usability and future-proofing the protocol.
