# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on expanding the Superchain ecosystem and laying the groundwork for next-generation fault proofs. The Superchain Token List saw significant growth with the addition of four new tokens, enhancing asset availability on Base and Ethereum. Concurrently, intensive technical discussions took place around the integration of the new `cannon-kona` fault proof game type, with a focus on updating core components like the dispute monitor and contract manager. Key operational issues were also resolved, including a clarification on expected `op-proposer` errors and a strategic decision to streamline chain data management by leveraging the Superchain Registry.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development work this week focused on growing the on-chain ecosystem by expanding the Superchain Token List.

- **Superchain Token List Expansion:** To improve interoperability and support for projects building on the Superchain, several new tokens were added. This included adding ARCv2 ([#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1184)), MITY ([#1185](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1185)), CIOTX ([#1191](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1191)), and FORT ([#1194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1194)) tokens, with most additions targeting the Base network.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving operational questions, streamlining data processes, and advancing discussions on critical future work related to fault proofs and node stability.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Proposer Error Clarification:** An issue regarding `op-proposer` errors ([#17042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17042)) was closed. It was clarified that `GameAlreadyExists` errors are expected behavior when the safe head has not advanced, providing valuable operational guidance for node operators.
    - **Chain Data Management:** To reduce maintenance overhead, the decision was made to use the Superchain Registry to populate the token list's available chains, closing issue [#1122](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1122).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Kona + Cannon Fault Proof Integration:** A significant portion of discussion focused on the upcoming `cannon-kona` fault proof system. Active issues track the necessary updates for `op-dispute-mon` to support the new game type ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17286]), changes required in the Optimism Portal Contract Manager (OPCM) for deployment ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17285)), and tooling for managing absolute prestates ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17283)).
    - **Node Stability and Tooling:** A bug is being investigated where P2P gossip configuration overwrites defaults with zero values, causing test panics ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17308)). Additionally, compatibility with Go 1.25 for Cannon remains under review ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17060)).
    - **Testing and CI/CD:** An issue to enhance sync tests was reopened to ensure all hardfork transitions are covered ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16703)), and discussions are ongoing to improve the developer experience for CircleCI configurations ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17184)).
    - **Ecosystem Growth:** Continuing the week's theme, a new pull request ([#1195](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1195)) was opened to add the FLIXX token for Base.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was prominent in the detailed technical discussions surrounding the Kona + Cannon integration. Contributors `ajsutton` and `pauldowman` were actively involved in clarifying requirements and refining issue scopes for `op-dispute-mon` ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17286)) and OPCM ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17285)), demonstrating healthy alignment on complex protocol upgrades. The steady stream of token addition PRs also indicates a smooth and effective collaboration process between the Optimism team and the broader ecosystem of projects building on the Superchain.
