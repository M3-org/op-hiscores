# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on expanding the Superchain ecosystem and refining critical operational documentation. A key development was the addition of the QUICK token on the Base chain, broadening asset support within the ecosystem. Concurrently, significant progress was made in finalizing the fault proof incident runbook, with versioning updates to align with specific releases. An important technical discussion around configurable data availability types for interoperability testing was also revisited, ensuring future test coverage remains robust.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
### Superchain Ecosystem Expansion
- The range of supported assets on the Superchain was enhanced with the addition of the `$QUICK` token on the Base chain, which included an update to its logo ([#1170](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1170)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
### Closed Issues
- **Fault Proof Runbook Finalized:** A major documentation effort concluded with the closure of the "Runbook v3 final review" ([#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16651)). The runbooks were updated to clarify which releases they apply to (v1 for pre-OPCM, v2 for U14 & U15, and v3 for U16+) and are now interlinked for easier navigation.

### New & Active Issues
- **Data Availability for Interop Testing:** Discussion was renewed on issue [#15406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15406) after it was reopened following an incorrect automated closure. The issue centers on the need for a batcher that uses blobs for interop fault proof testing. While not considered a blocker for the upcoming RC Beta, it remains an active topic for resolution before older fault proof support is deprecated.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's activity highlighted the importance of process and oversight, as seen in the manual reopening of an issue ([#15406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15406)) that was incorrectly closed by automation. This ensures that important technical discussions receive the necessary attention.
