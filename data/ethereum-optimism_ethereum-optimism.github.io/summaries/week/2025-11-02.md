# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity focused on expanding the Superchain ecosystem and advancing technical discussions on core protocol robustness. While several new tokens were successfully integrated across Base and other networks, significant conversations took place around improving the reliability of `proxyd` against backend sync issues and optimizing the `op-batcher`'s fee mechanism for blob transactions. These parallel efforts highlight a dual focus on growing the ecosystem's asset diversity while hardening the underlying infrastructure for future scalability and efficiency.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The primary completed work this week involved expanding token support within the Optimism ecosystem.

*   **New Token Listings:** A significant number of new tokens were added to various networks, increasing asset diversity for users and developers.
    *   SYND token was added to the main token list ([#1213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1213)).
    *   VEE token was integrated on the Base network ([#1225](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1225)).
    *   eUSD from ReserveProtocol was added to Base ([#1217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1217)).
    *   POLS token (Polkastarter v2) was added for ETH - Base ([#1229](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1229)).
    *   rETH was deployed to the Ink network ([#1231](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1231)).

*   **Work in Progress:** Several new pull requests ([#1234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1234), [#1235](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1235), [#1236](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1236), [#1237](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1237)) were opened to add the "MR_LIGHTSPEED Creator Coin" to Base, indicating ongoing community contributions.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened and no existing issues were closed this week. However, discussions on several active issues pointed toward significant future work on protocol security and efficiency.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **`proxyd` Backend Synchronization ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/501)):** A critical discussion is underway to prevent `proxyd` from returning outdated block data when backends are out of sync, a phenomenon described as "backwards time travel." Proposed solutions include fanning out `eth_call` requests to all backends or making `proxyd` aware of "block out of range" errors to silently fall back to a healthy backend.
    *   **`op-batcher` Blob Priority Fee Tracking ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102)):** A proposal was made to improve how the batcher handles transaction fees during busy periods. The suggestion involves having the starting priority fee for a new transaction "decay" from the previous one, rather than resetting to a minimum. This is seen as a potential "quick win" to ensure transaction inclusion while a more comprehensive fee tracker is considered.
    *   **Acceptance Test Enhancements ([#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16450)):** An issue was highlighted where the `sysgo` orchestrator lacks awareness of flashblocks and rbuilders, preventing related tests from being run. Implementing this is desired to validate changes in `kona-node` and `rollup-boost`.
    *   **`migrate` Method Scope ([#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17743)):** Discussions clarified that this issue is now scoped specifically to OPCM changes, with related devstack work being tracked separately, paving the way for its eventual resolution.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in both ecosystem growth and deep technical planning. The series of merged pull requests adding new tokens to Base and other networks demonstrates active integration from external projects. Simultaneously, the detailed discussions within active issues, such as the one on `op-batcher` fee tracking in [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102) featuring a comment from `ajsutton`, show focused engagement from core contributors on improving the fundamental components of the OP Stack. The opening of four separate PRs for a single creator coin also suggests enthusiastic, if uncoordinated, community participation.
