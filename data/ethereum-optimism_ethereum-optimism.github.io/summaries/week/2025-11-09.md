# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on maintenance, infrastructure evolution, and planning for future protocol upgrades. A routine update was made to the circulating supply data, reflecting ongoing tokenomics management. Key discussions focused on adapting tooling for upcoming changes, particularly ensuring compatibility with dispute-game v2. Additionally, progress was made in infrastructure cleanup, with the formal deprecation of older testing tools.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on routine data maintenance.

- **Tokenomics Data Refresh:** A minor but regular update was made to the `circulatingSupply.txt` file, ensuring the tokenomics data presented by the project remains current ([#1238](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1238)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving infrastructure-related tickets and continuing discussions on compatibility for future protocol features.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Infrastructure Deprecation:** An issue related to `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` was closed, officially noting the deprecation of Kurtosis as a testing tool ([#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16704)).
    - **Feature Tracking:** A tracking issue for adding embedded custom prestate support to Kona was closed, as a fix is now under review ([#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18271)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened based on the provided reports.
    - **Dispute Game v2 Compatibility:** Significant discussion continued on issue [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1148), which focuses on updating the `print_staging_report` script. The script needs to be adapted to read game arguments from the Dispute Game Factory (DGF) storage and must account for the future existence of multiple permissionless game types, which could impact the JSON output format.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active discussions around preparing project tooling for future protocol enhancements. The ongoing conversation in issue [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1148) highlights the community's proactive approach to ensuring smooth transitions for upgrades like dispute-game v2. This forward-looking planning is crucial for maintaining the stability and reliability of developer and operational tools.
