# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the stability and reliability of core infrastructure. A significant milestone was achieved with the confirmation that Flashblocks are now fully enabled and operational on all Sunnyside sequencers for Sepolia, completing a key infrastructure upgrade. Concurrently, work was done to improve the robustness of the CI/CD pipeline by implementing a more resilient RPC provider factory to mitigate timeouts and rate-limiting issues. While development was focused on stability, active issue triage continued, addressing a new CI logging problem and seeing community interest in resolving older RPC-related bugs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on bug fixes and reliability improvements rather than new features.

- **RPC Provider Reliability in CI/CD**
  To improve the stability of the CI/CD pipeline, a bug fix was merged to make RPC communication more resilient. PR [#1187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1187) introduced a robust provider factory that helps prevent failures from RPC timeouts and rate limiting by providing fallback mechanisms when primary endpoints fail.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of a major infrastructure task and the prompt investigation of a new CI-related problem.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks on Sepolia Sequencers:** The primary resolution was the closure of issue [#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16688), which confirmed that all Sunnyside sequencers (both voting and non-voting) for Sepolia are successfully running with Flashblocks enabled and connected to the websocket proxy. Failover capabilities were also successfully tested.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Missing CI Test Logs:** A new issue, [#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17151), was opened regarding missing logs for failed `op-acceptance-tests`. A maintainer quickly identified that the tests were running in a workflow not designed to capture these specific logs and noted that work is underway to move the tests, which should resolve the issue.
  - **Ongoing Discussions:** Active discussion continued in [#17001] concerning the refinement of the event system. Additionally, an older issue ([#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/389)) regarding RPC response content types received a comment from a community member asking how to contribute a fix, signaling external interest in helping improve the project.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
- The resolution of the Flashblocks issue ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16688)) demonstrated effective coordination between team members to validate and close out a critical infrastructure task.
- A notable instance of community engagement occurred on issue [#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/389), where a user proactively sought guidance on how to contribute a solution, highlighting interest from the wider community in improving the codebase.
- The quick diagnostic response from a maintainer on the newly opened issue [#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17151) showcases an active and responsive triage process within the team.
