# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Nov 23 - 29, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on protocol maintenance and investigation into core component behavior. While no new code was merged, a new pull request was opened to remove the POLS token from the project. The primary focus was a deep-dive discussion into a potential bug within the `op-node` sequencer recovery mode, with contributors collaborating to diagnose issues related to temporary errors and stalled L1 origin fetching. The period was characterized by problem analysis and preparation rather than feature implementation.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
No pull requests were merged this week, indicating a focus on ongoing development and issue triage.

A new proposal was opened for review:
*   **Token Removal:** A pull request ([#1241](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1241)) was initiated to remove the POLS token, suggesting a cleanup of project assets or configurations.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No issues were closed or newly opened during this period. The main activity was concentrated on an existing high-priority issue.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   Discussion intensified around issue [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18350), which concerns a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer recovery mode. Contributors are investigating why the sequencer might produce temporary errors and fail to advance the L1 origin even when the chain is healthy. The investigation is considering the impact of recent changes to asynchronous L1 origin fetching as a potential cause for the derivation stall.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the focused diagnostic effort on issue [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18350). Contributors @sebastianst and @geoknee worked together to analyze the sequencer recovery mode behavior, with one providing a potential code fix and the other conducting a deeper investigation into the root cause of persistent errors. This highlights a collaborative approach to ensuring the stability and security of core protocol components.
