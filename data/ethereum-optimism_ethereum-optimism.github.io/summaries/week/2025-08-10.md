# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Aug 10 - 16, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity was centered on planning, specification refinement, and architectural discussions rather than code implementation. Key conversations involved the potential deprecation of the event system, which surfaced during a review of a community contribution. Progress was made in defining the `min-base-fee` feature by creating a dedicated issue to analyze its state growth impact. Additionally, a new token was proposed for the Superchain List, and discussions continued on improving the testing infrastructure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no major features or bug fixes were merged this week, a new pull request was opened to expand the Superchain ecosystem:

- **Superchain Token List Expansion:** A proposal was submitted to add the $PAGE token and its logo to the Superchain List ([#1186](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1186)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week. The focus was on triaging new issues and advancing discussions on existing ones, highlighting future work on protocol specifications, testing, and internal tooling.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`min-base-fee` Specification:** To better quantify the impact of the `min-base-fee` feature, a new issue ([#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/316)) was opened to track the state growth estimation, separating it from the main specification ticket ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/742)). The estimate projects approximately 16MB of state growth per year.
    - **Event System Deprecation:** A significant discussion occurred in [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16874) regarding an event call graph. While a contributor offered a PR, the team indicated a preference for removing the entire event system, suggesting the contribution might not be merged but could still inform the removal process.
    - **Testing Infrastructure:** Discussion continued on integrating `op-test-sequencer` into the devnet environment to enable reorg tests ([#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15265)).
    - **Internal Task Migration:** A new issue ([#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1162)) was created to track the migration of blacklist games tasks and the removal of old FP recovery tasks.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted transparent communication and collaboration on key architectural decisions and tasks.

- In the discussion around the event system ([#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16874)), team member @pcw109550 provided clear feedback to contributor @sashass1315 about the project's strategic direction, even though it meant a submitted PR might not be merged.
- On the new task migration issue ([#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1162)), contributor @blmalone proactively offered assistance with the work, demonstrating a collaborative spirit within the community.
