# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity was characterized by a significant strategic realignment in development priorities. The project has officially deprioritized the Kurtosis devnet, leading to the closure of a large volume of related issues. This cleanup allows the team to refocus efforts on core protocol enhancements. In line with this, a new issue was opened to improve the efficiency of the `op-program`, signaling a continued focus on optimizing the OP Stack's foundational components.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided daily reports, there were no new features, bug fixes, or other code changes merged during this period. The development focus was on issue management and strategic planning.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was the primary activity this week, reflecting a shift in project focus.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Kurtosis Devnet Deprioritization:** A major cleanup effort resulted in the closure of numerous issues related to the Kurtosis devnet, which is no longer a development priority. This included the umbrella issue for idempotency and performance ([#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/14390)) and specific tasks like adding genesis checks ([#15753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15753)), L1 chain config mapping ([#15050](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15050)), and `op-validator` support ([#16712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16712)).
    - **Infrastructure Security:** A discussion on infrastructure threat modeling for flashblocks delivery ([#17144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17144)) was concluded. The outcome determined that no novel risks were introduced, with a recommendation to hardcode image digests in Kubernetes manifests as a short-term mitigation.
    - **Housekeeping:** An issue regarding v2 dispute game implementations ([#17259](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17259)) was closed as a duplicate.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`op-program` Enhancement:** A new issue ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17416)) was created to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookups in `op-program`, aiming to improve performance.
    - **Kurtosis Cleanup:** An issue to add websockets support to the Kurtosis reverse proxy ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17194)) was reopened. Despite the broader deprioritization, this issue is being tracked to ensure a related `TODO` in the codebase is properly removed.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The week's activity points to a period of internal strategic alignment rather than active code collaboration. The coordinated closure of multiple Kurtosis-related issues suggests a clear, top-down decision to shift development resources. The discussions, such as the one on infrastructure threat modeling, show a focus on risk assessment and process improvement.
