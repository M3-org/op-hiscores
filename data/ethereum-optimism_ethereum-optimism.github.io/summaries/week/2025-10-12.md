# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity focused on expanding the Base ecosystem and clarifying infrastructure responsibilities. A new pull request was opened to add the DRIP token to Base. Additionally, a key discussion on an active issue regarding replica-healthcheck monitoring resulted in important scope clarification, redirecting the effort to the appropriate infrastructure team and providing valuable guidance for contributor engagement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development effort this week was aimed at growing the token ecosystem on Base.

- **Token Additions:** A new pull request, [#1221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1221), was opened to add the DRIP token, contributing to the diversity of assets available on the platform.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week centered on clarifying ownership and scope for infrastructure-related tasks.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.
- **New Issues:** No new issues were opened.
- **Active Issues:** Discussion on issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17686), which concerns monitoring and alerting for replica-healthchecks, was a key focus. A maintainer clarified that this task is out of scope for `op-conductor` and is a "blocked" item intended for the Platforms Team. This highlights a potential blocker for replica monitoring until it is picked up by the correct team.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The discussion around issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17686) served as a clear example of community collaboration and process guidance. After a contributor submitted a pull request for the issue, a maintainer explained the scope and ownership mismatch, closing the PR but also encouraging the contributor to engage with maintainers for assignment before starting future work. This interaction reinforces the project's workflow for new contributions.
