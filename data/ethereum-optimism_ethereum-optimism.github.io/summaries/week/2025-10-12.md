# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week saw a significant expansion of the Superchain ecosystem, with a major focus on adding new tokens to Base and the broader Superchain token list. Key infrastructure work was completed, including the finalization of Data Availability (DA) Footprint limit specifications and testing, and coordination with RPC providers for Flashblocks. While progress was made on closing out operational issues, important discussions continue around core protocol components like the v2 dispute game implementation and `op-conductor` stability, signaling ongoing efforts to enhance protocol security and decentralization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on expanding the ecosystem's asset diversity and updating core data.

- **Superchain Token List Expansion:** The ecosystem's on-chain assets were broadened with the addition of several new tokens. ATTN ([#1212]), MIRROR ([#1209]), DSTRX ([#1208]), and RIO ([#1207]) were all integrated into the Superchain token list. New pull requests were also opened to add DRIP to Base ([#1221]) and ENSC to Lisk ([#1223]).

- **Token Address and Data Updates:** To ensure data accuracy, the Witnet (WIT) token address was updated on Sepolia ([#1215]), with a subsequent PR opened to settle its addresses on Ethereum and Base ([#1224]). Additionally, a pull request was opened to update the `circulatingSupply.txt` file ([#1222]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project saw the resolution of key infrastructure tasks while new and ongoing issues highlight areas of active development and user-facing challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Data Availability Footprint:** A series of issues related to the DA Footprint limit were closed. This included updating the specification to use the `blobBaseFee` header field ([#792]) and completing acceptance ([#17278]) and unit tests ([#17395]).
    - **Infrastructure & Coordination:** Coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers was successfully completed ([#17857]). An issue regarding sequencer management on Sepolia was also resolved, clarifying which sequencer was removed from the voter set ([#17683]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Dispute Game Implementation:** Issue [#17257], concerning the use of the v2 dispute game implementation, was reopened. A comment noted a remaining TODO in the acceptance tests, indicating that this critical security feature is not yet fully integrated.
    - **`op-conductor` Stability:** A new issue ([#17899]) was reported where a user experienced a sequencer failure with a "no unsafe head" error after linking `op-conductor`, highlighting a potential stability concern.
    - **Protocol Logic:** Discussion continues in [#17888] regarding the necessity of saturating math in the `operatorFee` getter, an important detail for the protocol's economic model.
    - **Monitoring:** An active discussion on graceful monitoring for replica-healthchecks ([#17686]) was clarified as an infrastructure team responsibility, not for `op-conductor`.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted active collaboration between the core team and the wider community. The influx of pull requests to add new tokens demonstrates strong interest from other projects to integrate with the Superchain. In issue [#17686], maintainer `yashvardhan-kukreja` provided helpful guidance to a new contributor, clarifying the contribution process and encouraging future involvement, which fosters a welcoming environment for new developers. The reopening of the dispute game issue ([#17257]) by a team member also shows diligent internal review and a commitment to tracking work to completion.
