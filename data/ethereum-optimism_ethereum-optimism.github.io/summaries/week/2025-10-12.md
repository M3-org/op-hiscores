# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week saw a significant expansion of the Superchain ecosystem with the addition of numerous tokens to various networks, including Base and Lisk. Alongside this growth, core protocol development focused on hardening infrastructure, with key issues resolved around Data Availability (DA) footprint limits and Sepolia sequencer management. Active discussions continue on critical components like the v2 dispute game implementation and sequencer health, indicating a sustained effort to improve protocol security and reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on expanding token support across the Superchain and updating core data files.

*   **Superchain Token List Expansion:** The ecosystem grew with the addition of several new tokens. This includes ATTN ([#1212](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1212)), DSTRX ([#1208](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1208)), and Realio Network (RIO) ([#1207](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1207)) to the Superchain list. Specific networks also saw new additions, with MIRROR ([#1209](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1209)) and DRIP ([#1221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1221)) integrated onto Base, and ENSC added to Lisk ([#1223](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1223)).

*   **Token Data and Address Updates:** The Witnet (WIT) token address was updated on Sepolia ([#1215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1215)), with a subsequent pull request opened to settle its addresses on Ethereum and Base ([#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1224)). Additionally, a PR was opened to update the `circulatingSupply.txt` file ([#1222](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1222)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on closing out infrastructure tasks while identifying and discussing new challenges in sequencer stability and protocol implementation.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Data Availability (DA) Footprint:** Significant progress was made with the closure of issues related to the DA Footprint Limit. This included adding acceptance tests ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17278)) and unit tests ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17395)). The specification was also updated to use the `blobBaseFee` header field ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/792)).
    *   **Infrastructure Management:** Coordination with RPC providers for the new Flashblocks node was successfully completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17857)). An issue concerning Sepolia sequencer demotion was also resolved by altering the plan to remove a different sequencer from the voter set ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17683)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Dispute Game Implementation:** A key issue ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17257)) regarding the use of the v2 dispute game was reopened. A comment noted a remaining TODO in the codebase, indicating that the v2 integration is not yet fully complete.
    *   **Sequencer Health:** A user reported a sequencer failure with a "no unsafe head" error after linking `op-conductor` ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17899)), seeking assistance.
    *   **Ongoing Discussions:** A discussion on graceful monitoring for replica-healthchecks ([#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17686)) clarified that the work belongs to the infrastructure team, not `op-conductor`. Another discussion is revisiting a potential saturating math issue in the `operatorFee` getter ([#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17888)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted constructive interactions within the community. In issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17686), a contributor's pull request was met with clear guidance from maintainer yashvardhan-kukreja, who clarified the issue's scope and encouraged future contributions through the proper channels. This interaction serves as a positive example of onboarding and guiding contributors. The reopening of the dispute game issue ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17257)) also demonstrates diligent tracking of work to ensure features are fully implemented before an issue is considered done.
