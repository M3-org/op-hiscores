# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Development in December focused on expanding the Superchain ecosystem and addressing the stability of core node components. While no major features were completed, new pull requests were opened to register token deployments for Base and World Chain. Concurrently, significant community and contributor discussions took place around troubleshooting critical node behaviors, particularly concerning `op-node` sync issues and `proxyd` block handling, with plans formulated to address these challenges in the near future.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on proposals to expand the ecosystem's token registry. No major technical features were merged based on the provided reports.

- **Ecosystem Token Additions:** Two pull requests were opened to add new token deployments.
  - A proposal was made to add the Canonical SKL Deployment from Ethereum to Base ([#1242](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1242)).
  - Another pull request ([#1243](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1243)) was opened to add the AMIE Token for World Chain on the Sepolia testnet.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management was concentrated on diagnosing and discussing existing problems with core infrastructure components, laying the groundwork for future fixes.

- **Closed Issues:** A single documentation issue ([#1895](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1895)) was closed due to a lack of sufficient context.

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, but discussions on several critical active issues progressed.
  - **`op-node` Stability:** Two separate `op-node` issues saw continued discussion. In [#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18468), a node getting stuck in EL sync mode was discussed, with a temporary workaround suggested. In [#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17448), another user confirmed experiencing an invalid block signature error, highlighting a recurring problem.
  - **`proxyd` Time Travel Concern:** The issue of `proxyd` potentially serving stale `unsafe` blocks ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/501)) was a key topic. A contributor confirmed that work to resolve this is scheduled to begin in January, acknowledging the importance of the issue.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident in the active troubleshooting of node-related issues. Users and contributors engaged in detailed discussions to diagnose problems, as seen in the `op-node` invalid block signature issue ([#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17448)) where a user confirmed a bug report. The community also provided temporary solutions, such as the suggested fix for the `op-node` sync issue ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18468)), demonstrating a collaborative approach to maintaining network stability.
