# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December was a month of deep technical investigation and stabilization, with a strong focus on the robustness of the OP Stack. While routine maintenance such as token supply updates and new asset registrations continued, the primary effort was directed towards diagnosing and discussing critical issues related to node synchronization, fault proof security, and P2P networking. Collaborative debugging efforts were prominent, with active discussions aimed at resolving complex bugs in `op-node`, `op-challenger`, and the `OptimismPortal2` contract, underscoring a commitment to protocol security and reliability ahead of future upgrades.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Development work this month focused on improving data integrity and financial transparency for the ecosystem.

- **Tokenomics Data Integrity:** Efforts were made to ensure the accuracy of public-facing tokenomics data. This included a routine update to the circulating supply file ([#1246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1246)) and the implementation of a new automated test to validate the existence and format of the `circulatingSupply.txt` file, enhancing the reliability of dashboards that depend on this information ([#1247](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1247)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The month was characterized by intensive triage and discussion around numerous high-priority issues, reflecting a focus on hardening the core protocol.

- **Closed Issues:** A single documentation issue regarding the consensus layer sync path was closed due to a lack of context ([#1895](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1895)).

- **New & Active Issues:** Discussions centered on several critical areas:
    - **Node Stability & Synchronization:** A significant portion of the month's effort was spent on node-related issues. These included an `op-node` invalid block signature error ([#17448]), nodes getting stuck in EL sync mode ([#18468]), and nodes failing to sync with "missing trie node" errors ([#18581]). Flaky P2P connections between `op-geth` and `op-reth` nodes in system tests were also identified as a high-priority problem ([#18570]). Additionally, a long-standing issue concerning `proxyd`'s potential to serve stale blocks was slated for attention in the new year ([#501]).
    - **Fault Proofs & Security:** Security of the fault proof system was a key concern. A critical fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when handling a null address was identified and prioritized for an immediate fix ([#18554]). Another discussion focused on an `op-challenger` panic caused by a `nil pointer dereference` when interacting with an L1 client not upgraded for Dencun, highlighting compatibility challenges ([#18608]).
    - **Protocol Optimization & Upgrades:** Conversations continued on simplifying the batcher by removing legacy `isPectra` checks ([#18479]) and the need to offload expensive operations in `kona-sp1` to improve ZK proof performance ([#18533]). The finalization of Upgrade 18 releases was also tracked, pending governance approval and testnet validation ([#18548]).
    - **Ecosystem Expansion:** New pull requests were opened to add the Canonical SKL Deployment from Ethereum to Base ([#1242](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1242)) and the AMIE Token on World Chain Sepolia ([#1243](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1243)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly visible in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. Team members like `rdin777` and `ajsutton` were frequently seen leading diagnostic efforts, requesting detailed logs, and clarifying protocol logic to help resolve complex bugs. The community showed active engagement, with users providing logs for synchronization issues ([#18581], [#17448]) and contributing to design discussions, such as the debate on handling invalid interop transactions ([#18574]). Notably, community member `Himess` expressed interest in taking on the task of creating a healthcheck for `op-rbuilder` ([#17685]), demonstrating a healthy pipeline for contributor involvement.
