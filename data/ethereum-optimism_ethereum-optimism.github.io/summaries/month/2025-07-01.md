# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of significant ecosystem growth and protocol refinement. The Superchain token list was expanded with the addition of several new assets, including CO, Super, QUICK, and TOWNS, reflecting a strong focus on interoperability. Concurrently, the team made substantial progress on documentation and stability by finalizing the v3 fault proof incident runbook and closing a backlog of older issues related to sequencer and node stability. Key technical discussions continued around fault proof contracts, op-geth performance, and data availability, signaling a deep focus on the security and efficiency of the OP Stack.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development focus this month was on expanding the list of supported tokens within the Superchain ecosystem, enhancing its utility and interoperability.

*   **Superchain Token Expansion:** The project integrated several new tokens, broadening the asset support across the ecosystem.
    *   The CO token was added with its corresponding logo and data ([#1169](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1169)).
    *   The Super token was integrated into Soneium ([#1171](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1171)).
    *   The QUICK token was added on the Base chain ([#1170](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1170)).
    *   The TOWNS token was added for both the Base and Ethereum chains ([#1178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1178)).
    *   Work also began on adding DGOLD ([#1174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1174)) and tBTC on Sepolia ([#1179](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1179)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in July focused on finalizing critical documentation, cleaning up the backlog of old stability issues, and initiating discussions on future infrastructure and protocol enhancements.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Documentation & Runbooks:** The v3 fault proof incident runbook review was completed, and the document was finalized. The runbooks were renamed to clarify which releases they apply to, improving operational readiness ([#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16651)).
    *   **Stability & Maintenance:** A number of long-standing issues were closed, including those related to sequencer halting ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/12240)), node startup failures ([#15411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15411)), and acceptance test reliability ([#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16378)).
    *   **Backlog Cleanup:** An issue for an outdated NPM package was closed as packages are no longer updated via that method ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/13459)), and a mode for pre-Interop logic was deprioritized and closed ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16520)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Block Explorer Migration:** A new initiative was started to migrate all Etherscan references for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia to Blockscout, with an issue opened to track the find-and-replace effort ([#1175](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1175), [#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1696)).
    *   **Fault Proofs:** A detailed discussion on the `Fault Proof creator contract OPCM changes` ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15789)) is ongoing, with a comprehensive checklist of tasks being actively addressed.
    *   **op-geth Performance:** The issue of abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/613)) continues to be a point of discussion, with users providing performance profiles and speculating that index rebuilding after updates may be the cause.
    *   **Protocol Mechanics:** Discussions around core protocol details continued, including a clarification on why precompile addresses are initialized with a 1 wei balance ([#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16620)) and ongoing work to track the "Min Base Fee" ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16807)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. The `op-geth` CPU usage issue ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/613)) saw multiple community members providing diagnostic files and sharing their experiences to help pinpoint the root cause. Similarly, the discussion around the `Fault Proof creator contract` ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/15789)) highlighted a structured approach to a complex feature, with contributor stevennevins outlining a clear checklist of action items. This collaborative spirit demonstrates an engaged community working together to improve the stability and functionality of the OP Stack.
