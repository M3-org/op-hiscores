# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
August was a month of focused execution, marked by the finalization of the `min-base-fee` specification, a significant milestone for the protocol's economic model. Development efforts also centered on enhancing developer experience and infrastructure robustness, with key improvements to CI reliability and token validation processes. The Superchain ecosystem continued to expand with the addition of several new tokens. Looking forward, the team initiated a major effort to migrate the OP Deployer to Forge and continued to advance the stability and monitoring of core features like flashblocks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on expanding the Superchain token list and improving the reliability of the development pipeline.

- **Superchain Token Ecosystem Growth:** The project continued to broaden its token support across the Superchain. New additions included the Pepe Community (PEPE) token for the Ethereum to Base bridge ([#1188](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1188)), the EL token on Soneium ([#1190](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1190)), the Wrapped WIT token on multiple testnets ([#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1183)), bwAJNA on Mode ([#1019](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1019)), and the $PAGE token ([#1186](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1186)).

- **Improved CI and Validation Reliability:** Significant bug fixes were implemented to bolster the development pipeline. A robust provider factory was introduced to mitigate RPC timeouts and rate-limiting issues in CI ([#1187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1187)). Additionally, retry logic was added to contract validation calls, reducing intermittent failures and improving the experience for contributors submitting new tokens ([#1189](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1189)).

- **Tokenomics Data Update:** Routine maintenance was performed with an update to the circulating supply data ([#1192](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1192)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
This month saw the resolution of a major specification issue, strategic deprioritization of older features, and the launch of a new migration effort.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **`min-base-fee` Specification Finalized:** The long-running issue to define the `min-base-fee` specification was closed after the design document was ratified, marking the completion of this important protocol enhancement ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/742)).
    - **Feature Deprioritization & Cleanup:** Several issues were closed to focus development efforts. This included shelving the implementation of consensus-influencing event nonces ([#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/13543)), deciding against adding challenger support to `op-up` ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17005]), and deprioritizing flashblocks support in Kurtosis ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16514)). The team is also leaning towards removing the event system entirely ([#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16874)).
    - **Operational & Testing Resolutions:** An issue confirming the successful enablement of Flashblocks on Sunnyside Sepolia sequencers was closed ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16688)). An issue regarding missing `op-acceptance-tests` logs was also resolved after the logs were located ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17151)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Forge Deployer Migration:** A significant new initiative was kicked off to migrate the OP Deployer to use Forge, with a main tracking issue ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17213)) and several sub-tasks created.
    - **Flashblocks Enhancements:** Discussions are ongoing to improve flashblocks, with a focus on load testing on devnets ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16756)) and establishing proper monitoring and alerts ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16867), [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16868)).
    - **P2P Sync Deprecation:** A forward-looking architectural discussion continues around deprecating the req-resp P2P sync in `op-node` in favor of a more efficient unsafe block sync mechanism ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/14108)).
    - **Documentation Overhaul:** A community member shared a comprehensive pull request to overhaul the guide for deploying an OP Stack Rollup, addressing confusion in the existing documentation ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1530)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
August showcased strong community engagement in key development areas. The newly created "OP Deployer Forge Migration" initiative saw immediate interest, with contributor `tooshiNoko` proactively offering to take on the entire set of related tasks ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17213), [#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17214)). In another example of valuable community contribution, user `krofax` submitted a "rich PR" to significantly improve the OP Stack Rollup deployment documentation ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1530)). These efforts highlight a healthy and active contributor base invested in improving both the core codebase and developer resources.
