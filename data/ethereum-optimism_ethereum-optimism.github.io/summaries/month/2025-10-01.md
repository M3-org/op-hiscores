# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of significant ecosystem growth and foundational protocol enhancements. The Superchain token list saw a major expansion, with numerous new tokens added to various networks, reflecting a growing and interoperable ecosystem. On the technical front, critical work on the Data Availability (DA) Footprint specifications was completed, including the finalization of designs and the implementation of acceptance tests. Concurrently, efforts continued to improve protocol stability, with active discussions and resolutions around sequencer management, health monitoring, and the ongoing integration of the v2 dispute game.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused heavily on expanding the Superchain's asset support and making routine but important updates.

- **Superchain Token List Expansion:** A primary focus was broadening the range of assets available across the Superchain. This included adding ATTN ([#1212]), DSTRX ([#1208]), and Realio Network (RIO) ([#1207]) to the Superchain token list. Specific networks also received new tokens, with MIRROR added to Base ([#1209]), ENSC to Lisk ([#1223]), and a proposal to add DRIP to Base ([#1221]). Additionally, the Witnet (WIT) token address was updated on Sepolia ([#1215]) and settled on Ethereum and Base ([#1224]).

- **Supply Data Maintenance:** A pull request was opened to update the `circulatingSupply.txt` file ([#1222]), ensuring accurate reporting of the OP token's circulating supply.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month centered on finalizing DA footprint work, managing sequencer operations, and addressing ongoing protocol development challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Data Availability Footprint:** A significant set of issues related to the DA Footprint limit was resolved. This included updating the specification to use the `blobBaseFee` header field ([#792]) and closing out tasks for writing acceptance tests ([#17278]) and unit tests ([#17395]).
    - **Sequencer Management:** An issue concerning the demotion of a Sepolia sequencer was resolved, with a decision made to keep the target sequencer active and remove a different one instead ([#17683]).
    - **RPC Provider Coordination:** Coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers for the new RPC node was successfully completed ([#17857]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Dispute Game Implementation:** The issue to use the v2 dispute game implementation was reopened ([#17257]), as a TODO item was identified in the acceptance tests, indicating that full integration is still in progress.
    - **Sequencer Stability:** A new issue was raised regarding a sequencer failure with an "no unsafe head" error after linking `op-conductor` ([#17899]), highlighting an active operational challenge.
    - **Protocol Health & Monitoring:** Discussion continued on graceful monitoring for replica-healthchecks ([#17686]), clarifying that this work belongs to the infrastructure team rather than `op-conductor`. Another discussion is ongoing regarding a potential saturating math issue in the `operatorFee` getter ([#17888]), with analysis underway to determine if changes are needed.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both internal development and external ecosystem engagement. The high volume of pull requests to add new tokens to the Superchain list demonstrates strong interest from other projects to integrate with the Optimism ecosystem.

Internally, the discussion on issue [#17686] provided a clear example of community guidance. A maintainer, `yashvardhan-kukreja`, clarified the scope of the issue for a contributor, `CreeptoGengar`, and encouraged them to coordinate with the team for future contributions, fostering a healthy and well-organized development process.
