# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development focused on expanding the Superchain ecosystem and hardening core protocol features. A significant number of new tokens were added to the Superchain and Base, broadening asset diversity and interoperability. Key progress was made on the Data Availability (DA) Footprint feature, with the closure of issues related to specification updates and testing. Meanwhile, ongoing discussions around the Dispute Game implementation and sequencer stability highlight a continued focus on protocol security and decentralization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on growing the on-chain ecosystem and maintaining core functionalities.

- **Superchain Token List Expansion:** A major effort was undertaken to increase the variety of assets available across the Superchain. This included adding ATTN ([#1212](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1212)), MIRROR ([#1209](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1209)), DSTRX ([#1208](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1208)), RIO ([#1207](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1207)), and DRIP ([#1221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1221)). Additionally, the Witnet (WIT) token address was updated on Sepolia ([#1215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1215)) and settled on Ethereum and Base ([#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1224)), and ENSC was added to Lisk ([#1223](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1223)).

- **Supply Update:** The `circulatingSupply.txt` file was updated via pull request [#1222](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1222).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month saw the completion of key infrastructure tasks and the emergence of important discussions for future development.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **DA Footprint Implementation:** Significant progress was made with the closure of several issues related to the DA Footprint Limit. The specification was updated to use the `blobBaseFee` header field ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/792)), and the corresponding acceptance tests ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17278)) and unit tests ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17395)) were completed.
    - **Infrastructure and Network Coordination:** Coordination with RPC providers for the new Flashblocks node was successfully completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17857)). A task related to Sepolia sequencer management was also resolved ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17683)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Dispute Game V2:** Issue [#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17257) was reopened, indicating that the v2 dispute game implementation is not yet fully integrated and requires further work.
    - **Sequencer Stability:** A new issue ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17899)) was opened by a user reporting a sequencer failure in `op-conductor` with a "no unsafe head" error, highlighting a potential stability concern.
    - **Protocol Refinement:** An ongoing discussion in issue [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17888) is reviewing the necessity of saturating math in the `operatorFee` getter, showing continued focus on the correctness of core protocol mathematics.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community interaction was evident in both contributions and issue management. In issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17686), a contributor's pull request for replica-healthcheck monitoring was guided by a maintainer who clarified the scope and encouraged future contributions through the proper channels. This interaction demonstrates a healthy process for onboarding and guiding new contributors. Additionally, the user-reported sequencer failure ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17899)) shows active engagement from the broader community in identifying and reporting potential bugs.
