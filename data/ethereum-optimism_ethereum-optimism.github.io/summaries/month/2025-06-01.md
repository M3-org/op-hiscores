# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
June was a month of stabilization and refinement, with a strong focus on the reliability of core OP Stack components and the enhancement of developer tooling. Significant effort was dedicated to investigating and hardening the `op-supervisor`, addressing its reset logic, event handling, and L1 origin validity. Concurrently, performance issues in the `op-batcher` and `op-geth` were actively diagnosed. The developer experience saw major improvements with a large-scale refinement of the Superchain-Ops tooling and a critical bug fix for the `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` package, which unblocked developers and expanded the ecosystem with new token integrations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month's completed work centered on expanding the token ecosystem and delivering a major update to developer operations tooling.

- **Token Ecosystem Expansion & Fixes:** A critical bug in the `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` npm package, which caused a missing `dist` directory and import errors, was resolved ([#1161](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1161)). The ecosystem's asset support was also broadened by adding BTREE token addresses ([#1143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1143)), Bridged EURC to Lisk ([#1157](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1157)), and the Glyphs token to the Base registry ([#1159](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1159)). A pull request was also opened to add support for BiLira (TRYB) ([#1165](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1165)).

- **Superchain-Ops Tooling Refinement:** A significant push on June 26 resulted in the closure of numerous issues related to the Superchain-Ops tooling, marking a major milestone in its development. Key improvements included enhancing CI job performance ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/648)), supporting "stacked" proposals with incrementing nonces ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/342)), improving task simulation behavior ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/448)), and refining the user experience for overriding nonces ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/770)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Discussions this month were dominated by efforts to improve the stability and performance of critical infrastructure components.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - A critical issue preventing the use of the `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` package was resolved ([#1146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1146)).
    - A large batch of issues related to the Superchain-Ops tooling was closed, covering CI, testing, task management, and architecture ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/337), [#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/636), [#777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/777), and others).
    - Issues related to Flashblocks acceptance testing and deployment were completed, moving the feature forward ([#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16496)).
    - A bug in `op-deployer v0.4.0-rc.2` was resolved in a subsequent release candidate ([#16618](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16618)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`op-supervisor` Stability:** A primary focus of ongoing work is the `op-supervisor`. Active discussions revolve around improving L1 origin validity checks during resets ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16315)), enabling data provision for fault proofs in non-genesis interop scenarios ([#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16166)), and investigating event overflows that can lead to crash-loops ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16335), [#16603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16603)).
    - **Component Performance:** Several high-priority performance issues are under investigation. These include high memory consumption in the `op-batcher` during L1 congestion ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16537)), abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` potentially related to log indexing ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/613)), and `op-node` getting stuck with thousands of goroutines ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16332)).
    - **Developer Experience & CI/CD:** Discussions continue on automating release pipelines with GoReleaser and `git-cliff` ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16097]), improving CI flakiness with better reporting ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16271)), and clarifying the distinct use cases for `supersim` and Kurtosis devnets for local development ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/399)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
June's activities highlighted a deeply collaborative approach to tackling complex technical challenges. Issues concerning the stability of core components like `op-supervisor`, `op-geth`, and `op-node` saw active participation, with multiple contributors providing detailed goroutine dumps, performance profiles, and diagnostic suggestions. The extensive discussion around CI SLAs ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16437)) demonstrated a healthy feedback loop between the core team and developers, leading to a consensus to focus on tangible improvements like reducing test flakiness. The coordinated effort to close a large volume of Superchain-Ops issues on a single day suggests a successful team sprint, significantly advancing the project's operational tooling.
