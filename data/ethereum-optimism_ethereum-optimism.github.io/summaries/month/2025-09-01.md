# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September's efforts focused on both expanding the Superchain ecosystem and advancing core protocol capabilities. The Superchain Token List grew significantly with the addition of several new tokens, enhancing interoperability for users. Concurrently, significant technical discussions progressed on integrating the next-generation `Kona + Cannon` fault-proof system, a critical step for the protocol's security and decentralization. Key operational issues were also addressed, including a clarification of `op-proposer` errors and a strategic move to streamline chain data management by leveraging the Superchain Registry.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development work this month centered on enriching the Superchain ecosystem by expanding its token support.

- **Superchain Token List Expansion:** The official token list was updated to support a variety of new assets across the ecosystem. This included adding ARCv2 ([#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1184)), MITY ([#1185](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1185)), CIOTX ([#1191](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1191)), FORT ([#1194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1194)), and opening a request for the FLIXX token ([#1195](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1195)). These additions provide official bridge support and enhance the utility of the Base network and the broader Superchain.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month involved resolving operational queries and driving forward discussions on major technical initiatives.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Proposer Error Resolution:** An issue regarding `op-proposer` `GameAlreadyExists` errors was closed ([#17042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17042)). It was clarified that this error is expected behavior when the safe head has not advanced. The resolution advises ensuring the batcher is running correctly.
    - **Superchain Registry Integration:** To streamline data management, an issue was closed that paves the way for using the Superchain Registry to populate the chains available for token lists, rather than maintaining a local list ([#1122](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/1122)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Kona + Cannon Integration:** A significant portion of discussion focused on the work required to support the new `cannon-kona` fault-proof game type. This multi-faceted effort involves updating `op-dispute-mon` to recognize the new game type ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17286)), modifying OPCM to handle its deployment ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17285)), and adapting tooling for absolute prestates ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17283)).
    - **P2P Configuration Bug:** An important bug is being addressed where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites default settings with zero values, causing panics in tests ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17308)).
    - **CI/CD and Testing Enhancements:** Discussions are ongoing to improve the developer experience around CircleCI configuration ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/17184)) and to enhance sync tests to cover all Hardfork transitions ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/16703)), which was reopened to ensure complete test coverage.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly visible in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. Contributors `ajsutton` and `pauldowman` were frequently engaged in clarifying the requirements for the Kona + Cannon integration, demonstrating close coordination on foundational protocol upgrades. The active dialogue around improving CI/CD and addressing the P2P gossip bug also highlights a strong internal focus on system stability and developer productivity. The steady stream of pull requests to add new tokens to the Superchain list suggests healthy engagement with projects building within the ecosystem.
