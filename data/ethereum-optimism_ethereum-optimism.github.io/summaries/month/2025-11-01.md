## 🚀 Highlights
Based on the available reports, development activity in November centered on proposals for new ecosystem assets and a key technical discussion around transaction fee management. While no new features were merged, several pull requests were opened to add a new creator coin to the Base network. Concurrently, an important conversation progressed on improving the `op-batcher`'s transaction inclusion strategy during periods of high network activity.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Based on the provided daily reports, there were no completed features, bug fixes, or documentation enhancements merged during this period. The primary development activity involved the submission of new pull requests that remain open.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
**Closed Issues:**
No issues were reported as closed in November.

**New & Active Issues:**
No new issues were opened. However, a significant discussion continued in issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102) concerning "op-batcher/txmgr: Blob priority fee tracking". A proposal was made to implement a "quick win" where the starting priority fee for new transactions would "decay" from the previously used fee instead of resetting to the minimum. This approach aims to make the batcher more effective at processing backlogs during busy periods by improving transaction inclusion rates.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community contribution was visible through the submission of three separate pull requests ([#1234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1234), [#1235](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1235), [#1236](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1236)), all focused on adding the "MR_LIGHTSPEED Creator Coin on Base". This indicates interest in expanding the ecosystem assets on Base. Additionally, the technical discussion in issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102) highlights ongoing collaboration on core protocol improvements.
