The L2 ProxyAdminOwner standard check seemed to have given a false positive when the op-deployer/OPCM because the L2 key handover should’ve failed when generating a recent testnet. Can we please investigate [testKeyHandover](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/689eba77586ebdcfe7a7098251d201ab68df1214/validation/key-handover_test.go#L12) and make sure its working as expected?\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\n<!--\r\n1.
