## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Fusaka Preparations and Prestate Updates
Discussions continued on the preparation for Fusaka, specifically regarding `op-geth` and updating the absolute prestate.
- **`op-geth` for Fusaka** ([#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/682)): It was confirmed that the `op-geth` update for Sepolia is complete, but the task remains open for Mainnet.
- **Superchain-ops task for absolute prestate update** ([#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1206)): The prestate update has been executed on Sepolia. The question was raised whether to keep the ticket open to track the Mainnet task.

### Observability and Monitoring
An issue regarding enabling observability/monitoring in sysgo is being discussed.
- **Enable observability/monitoring in sysgo** ([#17941](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17941)): A comment suggests this issue might be a duplicate of an existing issue in the `optimism` repository.

### `mise install` Error
A new issue was raised concerning an installation error with `mise`.
- **Optimism mise install error due to version pre-fix "v"** ([#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17963)): The error is attributed to the latest version of `mise`. A solution was provided, recommending the use of an install script from the `optimism` repository's `develop` branch to ensure a compatible `mise` version.
