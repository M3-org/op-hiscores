## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Optimism `mise install` Error Due to Version Prefix
Discussion on [#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17963) highlighted an issue where `mise install` fails due to an additional "v" character in the version string during URL formatting. The latest comment suggests that this is an issue with the latest version of `mise` and recommends using the `install_mise.sh` script from the latest `develop` branch of the Optimism repository to install a compatible version of `mise`.

### `op-geth`: Prepare for Fusaka
The issue [#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/682) tracks the preparation of `op-geth` for the Fusaka upgrade. The latest comments confirm that the Sepolia network has been updated, but the Mainnet update is still pending.

### Fusaka-Defense: Write Superchain-Ops Task for Updating the Absolute Prestate
Issue [#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1206) concerns the creation of a `superchain-ops` task to update the absolute prestate for the Fusaka upgrade. The latest comment indicates that this task has been completed and executed on Sepolia. A question was raised about keeping the ticket open to track the Mainnet task. Previous discussions involved using a template for drafting the task and the estimated Fusaka activation dates.
