# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Jun 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on setting a hardfork time for Swell Mainnet and significant progress on several issues, including flashblocks enablement, CI pipeline discussions, and op-batcher memory optimization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Configuration Updates
A key configuration update was made to set the Holocene hardfork time for Swell Mainnet, ensuring future network upgrades are properly scheduled and aligned. ([#1082](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1082))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened on Jun 25, 2025.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Integration and Testing
Several issues related to the integration and testing of flashblocks were closed. This includes enabling flashblocks on the `eris-0` environment for confidence building ([#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16468)) and completing acceptance tests for flashblocks transactions, including transfer and streaming tests. ([#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/354))

### Development Environment and Tooling Improvements
Improvements were made to the development environment, specifically addressing the ability to modify predeploys within Supersim, which now supports modifying the `L2toL2CDM` predeploy. ([#393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/393))

### CI/CD and Documentation Refinements
Discussions around implementing CI SLAs were concluded, with the decision not to implement them for now. ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16437)) Additionally, a broken link in the documentation for `L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol` was resolved. ([#283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/283))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher Memory Consumption
Discussions on optimizing the `op-batcher`'s memory consumption ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16537)) highlighted that the compressor is the primary source of memory usage during backlogs. Initial findings from `pprof` suggest that the publishing loop dominates, with significant allocations from writing to the compressor. Proposed optimizations include making the shadow compressor use less memory and more eagerly discarding the compressor after a channel is submitted. A related issue ([#16572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16572)) was opened to increase observability of memory consumption, with initial benchmarks showing 190MB per operation for a channel with 100 blocks.

### Superchain Output Roots and Withdrawal Pathways
The issue concerning withdrawal pathways for superchain output roots ([#821](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/821)) saw recent activity. A question was raised about which devnet to use for testing, specifically if the upcoming one is suitable, and if an endpoint is already available for testing.

### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet
A discussion on the differences between Supersim and Interop Kurtosis Devnet ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/399)) clarified that Supersim is a lighter, Anvil-based wrapper primarily for testing multichain/interop applications locally, especially for dapps, while Kurtosis is used for chain development.

### Feature Request: Logging User-Specified Contracts
A new feature request ([#411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/411)) was made to enable Supersim to log events for user-specified contracts, which was well-received as a "great idea."
