## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona + Cannon Support in OPCM
Discussions continued on [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17285) regarding the changes needed in OPCM to support Kona + Cannon. The latest comment from ajsutton clarifies that OPCM will need to support deploying the new game type, specifically highlighting a section in `OPContractsManager.sol` that will require updates. Earlier, pauldowman suggested confirming if any changes are truly needed before closing the issue.

### Kona + Cannon Support in op-dispute-mon
The issue [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17286) saw further discussion regarding op-dispute-mon's support for Kona + Cannon. pauldowman updated the issue description to "Update to support cannon-kona games." This follows ajsutton's earlier comment emphasizing that `op-dispute-mon` must return an error for unsupported game types and will need to be updated to explicitly support cannon-kana game types, rather than just looking at specific game types.
