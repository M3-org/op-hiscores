# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a new pull request to add Kona to standard prestates, and the closure of an issue related to a broken dependency in `op-chain-ops`. A new issue regarding `op-batcher`'s rollup config synchronization was also opened and discussed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No new technical developments were completed today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#1144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1144), was opened to add "kona" to the standard prestates validation.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dependency Resolution
The issue concerning a broken dependency in `op-chain-ops` related to `github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39` was closed today, as it was fixed by a pull request in the `optimism` repository ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16612)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Batcher Rollup Config Synchronization
A new issue, [#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18178), was opened to address the `op-batcher`'s behavior of only fetching the rollup configuration once at startup and not subsequently.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher: stay in sync with op-node rollup config ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18178))
Discussion on this newly opened issue centers on the `op-batcher`'s current behavior of only fetching the rollup configuration from `op-node` once at startup. The current approach is considered brittle, and potential solutions include making the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher or having the active endpoint provider signal when the endpoint changes to trigger a reload of the rollup config. The concern is that adding more concurrency to the batcher might be introduced if the endpoint provider controls it.
