## CLOSED ISSUES
### Dependency Resolution
A long-standing dependency issue with `github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39` in `op-chain-ops` was resolved. The issue, which stemmed from a version mismatch with a forked repository, was fixed by a related pull request in the main Optimism repository. ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16612))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-batcher Rollup Configuration Synchronization
Discussion continued on an issue regarding the `op-batcher`'s inability to stay in sync with the `op-node`'s rollup configuration after initial startup ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18178)). The current mechanism, where the `op-batcher` fetches the rollup config only once at startup, was identified as brittle. Suggestions included making the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher to ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary concurrency. Another alternative proposed was to have the active endpoint provider signal changes, triggering a reload of the rollup config. The trade-off for explicitly providing the config would be the need for a new batcher release for each Superchain Registry config change, which is not currently the case.
