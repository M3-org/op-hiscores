# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's activity included an automated codegen update and significant discussion on interop issues, particularly around replacement transactions and super root handling in op-challenger.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Automated Code Generation
An automated code generation update was performed, modifying `chainList.json` and `chainList.toml` ([#1186](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1186)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interop Test Enablement
The issue concerning disabled Kona interop action tests was closed, with confirmation that the tests are now enabled, though not yet blocking CI ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18613)).

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18574))
Discussions continued regarding the necessity of replacement transactions for interop. The latest comment from Inphi indicates a consensus to simplify the spec by removing the additional transaction, as it provides no value in a ZK dispute system. This follows earlier discussions where ajsutton highlighted the downsides of not having consensus-checked data and the potential for issues with derivation process availability, though acknowledging these might be less of a concern with ZK proofs. rdin777 summarized the consensus to simplify the protocol by eliminating the extra deposit transaction for proofs and called for architectural refactoring and specification updates.

### op-challenger: Review correct trace output when next super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18643))
Inphi confirmed that the identified issue appears to be a real problem, noting that `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash on the first chain with insufficient data. Inphi also questioned the correctness of the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test and clarified that the supervisor's superroot RPC returns a "not found" error if any chain isn't supported by L1, even if it's okay with returning super roots for non-cross-safe blocks.
