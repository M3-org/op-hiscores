# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's activity included an automated codegen update and significant discussion on interop issues, particularly around replacement transactions and super root handling in op-challenger.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Automated Code Generation
An automated code generation update was performed, modifying `chainList.json` and `chainList.toml` ([#1186](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1186)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interop Test Enablement
The issue concerning disabled Kona interop action tests was closed, with confirmation that the tests are now enabled. Further work is planned to make these tests a blocking part of CI once Kona is migrated to the Optimism monorepo ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18613)).

## NEW ISSUES
### op-challenger Super Root Review
A new issue was opened to review the correct trace output in `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found, highlighting a potential problem with how `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18643)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18574))
Discussions continued regarding the necessity of an additional transaction for replacement blocks in the interop protocol. The latest comments indicate a growing consensus to simplify the protocol by removing the additional deposit transaction, especially considering its lack of value in a ZK dispute system. It was noted that while the additional transaction is critical for fault proofs in the current system, ZK proofs would re-run the derivation process, making the data always available. The next steps involve assigning someone to architecturally refactor this mechanism and updating the Interop specification.
