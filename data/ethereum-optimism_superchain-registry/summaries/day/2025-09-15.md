# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Sep 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on refining chain configurations by reducing redundant address data, enhancing efficiency and maintainability. Several issues related to load testing, partner support criteria, and a critical receipt decoding bug were closed, indicating significant progress in stability and operational readiness.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Configuration File Optimization
A significant refactoring effort was completed to streamline chain configuration files. This involved reducing the number of contract and role addresses directly embedded in `.toml` files, as these frequently change. By relying on the `addresses.json` codegen file for these dynamic values, the configuration files are now less prone to becoming stale, improving maintainability and accuracy across various Superchain configurations. ([#1103](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1103))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#1105](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1105), was opened to add the Sova testnet to the registry.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Operational Readiness and Testing
Several issues related to the operational readiness of the Superchain were closed. This includes the successful completion of load testing for flashblocks on devnets ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16756)) and the evaluation of partner support criteria on the `eris-0` chain ([#16765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16765)). These closures indicate that critical testing and validation phases have been completed.

### Configuration and Data Management
An issue focused on reducing redundant chain configuration addresses was closed ([#978](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/978)). This aligns with the day's code refactoring efforts to improve the maintainability and accuracy of configuration files by centralizing dynamic address data.

### Threat Modeling and Analysis
A threat modeling and failure modes analysis for the DA Footprint Limit was completed and closed ([#336](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/336)), with a link to the Miro board summarizing the findings.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened on this day.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Receipt Correction: Failed to decode RLP receipts ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/679))
The issue, reporting Geth crashes due to failed RLP receipt decoding during full sync on op-mainnet, saw active discussion. @sebastianst confirmed the team has experienced this issue when snap-syncing an op-mainnet node and is investigating. A potential fix ([this fix](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/680)) was suggested for @cpuchainorg to try. @cpuchainorg later confirmed that the issue seems to be fixed with the latest version patch.

### Dispute game creator pattern refactor: update specs ([#17436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17436))
Discussion revolved around whether this issue is a duplicate of another. @stevennevins asked @pauldowman if it duplicates `optimism/issues/15784` or if it intends to delve deeper into constructor and `implArgs` functionality. @pauldowman later marked it as a duplicate.
