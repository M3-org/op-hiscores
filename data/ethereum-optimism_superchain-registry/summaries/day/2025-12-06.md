## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Developer Contribution Interest
Several issues saw new comments from "Himess" expressing interest in contributing and asking if the issues were "live" or available to be taken. These include:
- **`IOptimismMintableERC20.bridge` Function Type** ([#9697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/9697)): Discussion continued regarding whether `IOptimismMintableERC20.bridge` should be a `view` function, with Himess asking if the issue is live.
- **MIPS64Memory Comment Discrepancy** ([#13435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/13435)): Himess inquired about taking this issue, which concerns a comment stating "4 bytes" when it should refer to "word size."
- **Incorrect `readMem` and `readMemUnchecked` Comments** ([#13436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/13436)): Himess expressed interest in addressing the incorrect structured comments for return values in `MIPS64Memory.sol`.
- **op-program Bedrock Contracts Test Setup Failure** ([#15220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15220)): Himess asked if they could work on this issue, which describes a Solady library mapping problem.
- **Removal of `isPectra` from Batcher** ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18479)): Himess indicated they had investigated the issue, noting changes would be needed in approximately five Go files, and asked to take it on.

### Devnet Spammer Component
Discussion continued on creating a new `op-spammer` component for devnet deployments ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18482)). "scharissis" referenced `flashbots/contender` as prior art, specifically an issue within that repository.

### op-node Synchronization Issues
A critical issue regarding `op-node` v1.16.3 failing to synchronize was updated ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18510)). "geoknee" commented that the reported log line is not uncommon after a restart and requested more detailed logs and metrics, particularly concerning safe and unsafe heads. They also recommended upgrading `op-geth` to v1.101603.5.
