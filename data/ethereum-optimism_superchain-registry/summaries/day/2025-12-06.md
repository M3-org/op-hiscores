## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Community Interest in Open Tasks
Several community members, specifically "Himess," expressed interest in taking on various open issues, including whether `IOptimismMintableERC20.bridge` should be a view function ([#9697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/9697)), correcting a comment about byte size ([#13435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/13435)), fixing incorrect structured comments for `readMem` and `readMemUnchecked` ([#13436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/13436)), and addressing a Solady library mapping issue in `op-program` bedrock contracts test setup ([#15220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15220)). Himess also inquired about taking on the task of removing `isPectra` from the batcher, noting that it would involve changes in approximately five Go files ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18479)).

### Devnet Spammer Component
Discussion continued on creating a new `op-spammer` component for deployment in devnets. "scharissis" referenced "flashbots/contender" as prior art that might be relevant to this task ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18482)).

### op-node Synchronization Issues
"geoknee" provided guidance on an issue where `op-node` v1.16.3 was failing to synchronize, requesting more detailed logs and metrics, and suggesting an upgrade to `op-geth` v1.101603.5 ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18510)).
