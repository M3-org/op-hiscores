# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Sep 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a bug fix to add Isthmus time for the arena-z-testnet. Several issues related to flashblocks enablement, sequencer health alerts, and op-conductor deployment were closed, indicating progress in infrastructure stability and monitoring.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Configuration Updates
A bug fix was implemented to correctly add Isthmus time for the arena-z-testnet configuration, ensuring accurate time synchronization for the test network ([#1104](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1104)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Stability
Several issues related to the enablement and stability of flashblocks on mainnet sequencers were closed. This includes enabling flashblocks on a production mainnet sequencer ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16759)), enabling flashblocks on remaining sequencers ([#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16760)), and enabling flashblocks on a specific mainnet sequencer ([#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17317)). The stability of flashblock production was confirmed.

### Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerts
Issues concerning alerts for sequencer health were resolved. This includes adding an alert for low peer count health of flashblocks-enabled sequencers ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16868)) and an alert for unhealthy non-flashblocks enabled sequencers ([#17143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17143)). Additionally, the deployment of op-conductor with EL p2p healthchecks was completed ([#17153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17153)).

### Documentation and Testing Improvements
A documentation issue suggesting an example for custom chains in bridging ETH to OP Mainnet was closed after the tutorial was updated ([#1473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1473)). Several "smoke test" issues for op-challenger, op-dispute-mon, and op-proposer were closed as they are no longer required ([#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/141), [#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/142), [#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/143)).

### Rbuilder and Reth Upgrade
An issue to upgrade rbuilder and node-reth to address a reth chain stall fix was closed, as it was determined to be a non-blocker for L2 ([#17328](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17328)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Websockets Support in Kurtosis Reverse Proxy
Discussion on [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17194) indicates that Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy will not be implemented. A comment from @alfonso-op on 2025-09-11T07:30:45Z requested the removal of a TODO in the code before closing the issue, as the feature is no longer planned. This follows a previous comment from @ajsutton on 2025-09-10T21:57:35Z highlighting the existence of the TODO.

### Adding Soneium to Contract Upgrade Tests
Issue [#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17332) is active, with @MozirDmitriy commenting on 2025-09-11T13:15:42Z that a pull request has been opened to address the task of adding Soneium to the contract upgrade tests.

### Op-program: Fast Block Header Oracle Lookup Hint
Issue [#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17416) is discussing the addition of a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in op-program. @emhane commented on 2025-09-11T10:41:48Z to bring the issue to @meyer9's attention for visibility. This follows @ajsutton's comment on 2025-09-10T21:59:32Z, which provided a draft PR as a starting point for validation.
