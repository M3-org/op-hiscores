# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing CI/CD processes with a new daily codegen job and fixing its trigger. Several issues related to validation, hard fork inheritance, and Kurtosis investment were closed, reflecting a shift towards report-based approaches and updated priorities.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD Enhancements and Automation
A new daily codegen job was introduced to ensure codegen'd files remain up-to-date by automatically running codegen and creating a PR if differences are detected. A fix was also implemented to correctly trigger this daily codegen job in CircleCI.

- [#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/689)
- [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/696)

### Hard Fork and Configuration Updates
Issues related to hard fork activation inheritance behavior and the `daFootprintGasScalar` default value for the Jovian upgrade were closed, reflecting finalized specifications and updated default values.
- [#715](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/715)
- [#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/773)

### CI/CD and Tooling Improvements
A new daily codegen job was implemented and the corresponding issue was closed, ensuring automated updates for codegen files.
- [#979](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/979)

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis Investment and Tooling
The issue [#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16975) regarding the ability to use local `op-geth` builds with Kurtosis was closed, as Optimism is no longer investing in Kurtosis. The discussion included suggestions for templating systems to automatically override images or build local Docker images.

### Dispute Game Contract Updates
Issue [#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17267) concerning the update of `OPCMStandardValidator` to handle new dispute game contracts was reopened. Initially, it was believed to be resolved, but tests are still skipped when V2 is enabled, indicating further work is needed.

### Interopgen Configuration
Issue [#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17614) about rewiring interopgen config was closed as "won't fix." The rationale is that interopgen is only used by `op-e2e`, and new tests are now added as acceptance tests, eliminating the need for further configuration.

### DA Footprint Limit Investigation
Issue [#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17946) investigating why the block right after genesis still has a 0 gas scalar was updated. The cause was identified as how the first block's L1 block attributes were populated from the genesis `SystemConfig`, which may have a 0 scalar that was not translated. A fix has been implemented in PR #17947.

### Jovian Upgrade Transactions
Issue [#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/772) to update the Jovian upgrade transactions' bytecode when finalized was closed. The specs and `op-node` have been finalized, resolving the issue. Earlier discussions highlighted a conflict where the L1 block contract and gas price oracle contract were deployed to the same address, which was resolved by using the monorepo to manage conflicts and regenerate transactions.
