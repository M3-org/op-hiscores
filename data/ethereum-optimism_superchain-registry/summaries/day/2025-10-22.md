# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing CI/CD reliability with a fix for the daily-codegen trigger and the introduction of a new daily codegen job. Several issues related to validation and hard fork activation inheritance were closed, reflecting a shift towards report-based approaches.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **CI/CD Enhancements for Codegen Reliability:**
    *   Fixed an issue preventing the daily-codegen from properly triggering on CircleCI schedules ([#1123](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1123)).
    *   Introduced a new daily-codegen job to ensure codegen'd files are updated regularly, creating a PR if diffs are detected ([#1120](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1120)).
    *   An automated codegen update was performed, resulting in changes to `superchain/extra/addresses/addresses.json` ([#1124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1124)).

*   **Superchain Configuration Updates:**
    *   The `worldchain-sepolia` Isthmus activation timestamp was updated in `superchain/configs/sepolia/worldchain.toml` and `superchain/extra/addresses/addresses.json` ([#1119](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1119)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Streamlining Validation Processes:**
    *   Closed issues related to validating all chains on PRs and running genesis validation checks for frontier chains, indicating a move towards report-based validation rather than blocking checks ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/689), [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/696)).

*   **Hard Fork and Configuration Refinements:**
    *   The issue concerning hard fork activation inheritance behavior was closed, suggesting that any chain can now opt-in to automatic hard fork activation ([#715](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/715)).
    *   A task to create a new daily codegen job was closed, as the functionality has now been implemented ([#979](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/979)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Jovian Upgrade Finalization:**
    *   The issue regarding updating Jovian upgrade transactions' bytecode was closed, with finalization confirmed through specs and `op-node` updates. The discussion highlighted a previous conflict where the L1 block contract and gas price oracle contract were deployed to the same address, which was resolved by using the monorepo to manage conflicts and regenerate specs ([#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/772)).
    *   The issue to update the Jovian `daFootprintGasScalar` default value was closed, with a value of 400 settled upon as a good tradeoff ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/773)).

*   **Dispute Game Contract Updates:**
    *   The issue to update `OPCMStandardValidator` for new dispute game contracts was reopened. While initially thought to be done, tests are still skipped when V2 is enabled, indicating further work is needed ([#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17267)).

*   **Data Availability Footprint Limit Investigation:**
    *   An issue investigating why the block right after genesis still has a 0 gas scalar was updated. The cause was identified as how the first block's L1 block attributes were populated from the genesis SystemConfig, which may have a 0 scalar that was not translated. A fix has been implemented ([#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17946)).

*   **Developer Tooling and Faucet Access:**
    *   The issue to add a Sepolia ETH faucet to the Protocol R&D Discord was closed, as the team is moving away from Discord for this purpose, with account funding now in-scope for devnet efforts ([#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/12952)).
    *   The request for Kurtosis to use a local `op-geth` build was closed, as investment in Kurtosis is no longer a priority ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16975)).

*   **Interopgen Configuration:**
    *   The issue to rewire interopgen config was closed as "won't fix." Interopgen is primarily used by `op-e2e`, and new tests are now added as acceptance tests, eliminating the need for further configuration ([#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17614)).
