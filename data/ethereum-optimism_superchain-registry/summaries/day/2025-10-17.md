## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Fusaka Upgrade Preparations for op-batcher**
  The discussion on [#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17472) indicates that the issue has been reopened. The primary focus is on releasing a new batcher version that automatically switches to cell proofs and includes the mainnet Fusaka activation time.
- **Refining op-batcher Shutdown Logic**
  Regarding [#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17768), the latest thinking is to maintain the current detection logic for "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" but ensure that the shutdown exits the entire process. This change aims to enable the batcher to enter a crashloop and automatically recover once the RPC method becomes available.
