### Fusaka Upgrade Preparations
Discussions on [#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17472) indicate that the issue has been reopened to cover releasing a new batcher version. This version will include automatic switching to cell proofs and the mainnet Fusaka activation time baked into `op-service` / `op-geth`. Previously, manual testing against a Fusaka L1 was outlined.

### Batcher Shutdown Logic Refinement
Regarding [#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17768), the latest thinking is to maintain the current detection logic for "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" errors. Instead of introducing new metrics or logs, the focus is on ensuring the entire process exits during shutdown, not just a part of the batcher. This would allow the batcher to enter a crashloop and automatically recover once the `SetMaxDASize` RPC method becomes available.
