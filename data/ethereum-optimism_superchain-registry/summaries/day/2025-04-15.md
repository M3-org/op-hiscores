## NEW ISSUES
### Chain Configuration Optimization
A new issue was opened to discuss reducing the number of addresses in chain configuration `.toml` files to a minimal set. The proposal suggests that frequently changing contract/role addresses should instead be read from the `addresses.json` codegen file to prevent the config files from becoming stale. This aims to improve the maintainability and accuracy of chain configurations. [#978](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/978)
