## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Event Call Graph Discussion
Discussion continued on [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16874), which proposes adding logic to trace event flow. On Aug 14, 2025, @sashass1315 mentioned they had added a PR and requested a review. On Aug 15, 2025, @pcw109550 responded, stating that while they appreciated the contribution, the team was leaning towards removing the entire event system, suggesting the PR might not be merged but the code could still be useful for understanding control flow. The issue was later closed on Aug 25, 2025, by @mslipper, who noted that similar functionality exists in another PR.
