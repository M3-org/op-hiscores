# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw an automated codegen update to `addresses.json` and the resolution of several key issues, including an `op-node` synchronization problem and documentation improvements for JSON-RPC API and environment variables.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Automated Code Generation
An automated codegen update was performed, specifically modifying the `addresses.json` file within the `superchain/extra` directory. This update is part of routine maintenance to keep the registry current. ([#1177](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1177))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Node Synchronization and Upgrade Issues
An issue concerning `op-node` synchronization after an upgrade to v1.16.3 was resolved. The problem, which prevented Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments from synchronizing, was fixed by upgrading and resyncing `op-geth`. ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18510))

### Documentation Improvements
Two documentation-related issues were closed. One involved updating the JSON-RPC API documentation to separate `op-node` and `op-geth` information and testing the `op-node` section on a test sequencer. ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1773)) The other addressed the absence of environment variable descriptions for `op-node` and `op-geth` flags in the documentation. ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1874))
