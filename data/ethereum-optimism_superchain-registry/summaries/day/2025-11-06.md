# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating prestate validation for Kona and addressing several ongoing issues, including Go 1.25 compatibility for Cannon and `op-batcher` synchronization with `op-node` rollup configurations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Prestate Validation Updates
A new update was implemented to add Kona to the standard prestates, enhancing the prestate validation script within the monorepo to verify these new Kona prestates ([#1144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1144)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kona + Cannon Audit
The issue concerning the audit of OPCM changes for Kona and Cannon has been closed, as it is now covered by a related issue in the `optimism` repository ([#17371](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17371)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility
Discussions continued regarding Cannon's compatibility with Go 1.25 ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17060)). The latest comment confirms that the issue affecting MIPS emulation and keccak hashes has been fixed in Go 1.25.4. Previously, it was noted that all keccak hashes were incorrect when running Cannon with Go 1.25, impacting block hash calculations.

### op-batcher [altda]: Max Frame Size
The issue regarding the `op-batcher` not limiting max frame size to max input size in generic mode for altDA was discussed ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17796)). A recent comment indicates that this was addressed in a pull request in the `optimism` repository, and there's a suggestion to update the spec to reflect this change.

### op-sync-tester: Support Jovian
A pull request has been made to address the issue of patching the Sync Tester to support Jovian and add Jovian HF tests ([#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18126)).

### op-batcher: Stay in Sync with op-node Rollup Config
Discussions revolved around the `op-batcher`'s current behavior of only fetching the rollup config once at startup and not updating it afterwards ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18178)). A suggestion was made to have the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher, which could simplify consistency. While this might require a new batcher release for each Superchain Registry config change, it offers a more explicit and consistent approach compared to relying on RPC fetches.
