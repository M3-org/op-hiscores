# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on updating prestate validation for Kona and addressing several active issues, including a critical Go 1.25 compatibility problem for Cannon and discussions around `op-batcher` synchronization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Prestate Validation Updates
A new update was implemented to include Kona in the standard prestate validation process. This ensures that the prestate validation script in the monorepo can now verify Kona prestates, enhancing the robustness of the system. ([#1144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1144))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kona + Cannon Audit
The issue concerning the audit of OPCM changes for Kona and Cannon has been closed, as it is now covered by a related issue in the main Optimism repository. ([#17371](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17371))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility
Discussions on [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17060) highlight a critical bug where all Keccak hashes are incorrect when Cannon runs with Go 1.25, impacting block hash calculations. The latest comment from pauldowman confirms that this issue has been fixed in Go 1.25.4.

### op-batcher: Max Frame Size in Generic Mode
Issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17796) addresses a bug where `op-batcher` incorrectly limits the max frame size to the max input size in generic commitment mode for altDA. tessr's latest comment indicates that this issue was addressed in a separate pull request ([#18074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074)) and questions if the issue can now be closed.

### op-batcher: Stay in Sync with op-node Rollup Config
The discussion on [#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18178) revolves around the `op-batcher`'s current behavior of fetching the rollup config only once at startup, leading to potential desynchronization. sebastianst suggests that making the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher could be a simple and pragmatic solution, especially since the batcher already has access to embedded superchain-registry configs. However, a downside is that this would necessitate a new batcher release for each Superchain Registry config change. joshklop supports the idea of making the dependency explicit to avoid brittleness.

### op-sync-tester: Support Jovian
Issue [#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18126) focuses on patching the Sync Tester to support Jovian and add Jovian HF tests. CreeptoGengar has submitted a pull request that they hope will resolve this issue.
