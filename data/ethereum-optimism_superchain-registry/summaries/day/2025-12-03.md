## CLOSED ISSUES

### ZK Proof Generation and Challenger Support
Several issues related to the generation of ZK proofs and the `op-challenger`'s support for ZK game types were closed. This indicates a decision to use the succinct proposer for ZK proof generation and progress in integrating ZK game types into the `op-challenger`.
- SPIKE: Investigate which service should generate ZK proofs ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18319))
- op-challenger: Support challenging ZK game types ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18321))

### Challenger Improvements and Refinements
Issues concerning `op-challenger` test coverage, reading from the DGF registry, fetching challenger bonds, and handling bond/challenger address changes were closed. These closures suggest that the `op-challenger` is now capable of handling these aspects, particularly in the context of ZK games.
- challenger: Improve test coverage ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18427))
- challenger: Read from DGF registry using kona-genesis crate ([#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18412))
- challenger: Fetch challenger bond from game args ([#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18413))
- challenger: reload bond values (regularly, or detect if changed) ([#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18414))
- challenger: support challenger address changing ([#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18415))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node` EL Sync Mode Stuck
The issue regarding `op-node` getting stuck in EL sync mode after a restart when reth already has synced data continues to be discussed. A user reported experiencing the same issue, blocking their Base Mainnet node. A temporary fix suggested is to change the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restart the `op-node`.
