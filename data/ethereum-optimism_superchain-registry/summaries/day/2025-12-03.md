## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Automated Code Generation
An automated code generation update was performed, ensuring the registry remains current with the latest configurations. ([#1173](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1173))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### ZK Proof Generation Strategy Finalized
The investigation into which service should generate ZK proofs concluded, with the decision to use the succinct proposer for this task. ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18319))

### Challenger Support for ZK Game Types
Work on enabling `op-challenger` to support challenging ZK game types has been completed. ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18321))

### Challenger Improvements and Refinements
Several issues related to challenger functionality were closed, including improvements to test coverage, reading from the DGF registry, fetching challenger bonds from game arguments, reloading bond values, and supporting challenger address changes. These closures indicate that the `op-challenger` is now considered capable of handling these aspects for ZK games.
