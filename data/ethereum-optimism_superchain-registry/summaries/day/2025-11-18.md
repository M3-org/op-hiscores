## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Superchain Registry 2.0 Refactor Impact:** Several issues were closed as they were addressed by the Superchain Registry 2.0 refactor, including modifications to the `add-chain` tool to allow chains to opt-in to hardforks ([#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/610)), improvements to the `golang-validate-all` CI job for better pass/fail summaries ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/644)), and encoding `ProxyAdminOwner` exceptions for Base and Unichain ([#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/675)).
*   **Outdated Test Investigation:** An investigation into an L2 key handover test was closed as it was no longer relevant after the Superchain Registry 2.0 refactor. ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/643))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Cleanup of Event System Refactor Comments:** Issue [#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16917) was reopened by ajsutton, noting that there are still numerous TODOs related to cleaning up comments from the event system refactor across various files in `op-node` and `op-e2e`. The comment emphasizes the need to track these items via GitHub issues rather than TODOs in code.
*   **op-devstack: sysext: fix address book:** Issue [#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15817) was reopened by ajsutton, who noted that despite a previous comment from mslipper stating the issue was closed due to KT being deprecated, there are still TODOs referencing this issue in `op-devstack/sysext/addrbook.go`.
*   **op-supervisor: Drop multi-node support:** Issue [#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16174) was reopened by ajsutton, highlighting a remaining TODO in `op-e2e/interop/interop_test.go` that references this issue, despite mslipper's earlier comment about dropping support.
*   **Interop: Remove anchor point RPC:** Issue [#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16140) was reopened by ajsutton, who identified multiple TODOs across `op-node` files that still reference this issue, indicating that the removal of the anchor point RPC is not fully complete.
*   **op-node: Let sync-start not cross into Interop activation:** Issue [#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16141) was reopened by ajsutton, pointing out a remaining TODO in `op-node/rollup/sync/start.go` that references this issue.
*   **op-supervisor: remove check-access-list backward compat chainID fallback:** Issue [#16245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16245) was reopened by ajsutton, who found a TODO in `op-supervisor/supervisor/backend/backend.go` still referencing this issue, indicating that the backward compatibility fallback has not been fully removed.
*   **op-node: On the Initial EL Sync UX and Correctness:** mslipper commented on issue [#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17631), stating that this issue should be addressed once request/response sync is fully deprecated.
*   **op-node: Safe Head Advancement during EL Sync:** mslipper commented on issue [#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18124), suggesting that this issue can be punted until the full deprecation of request/response sync.
*   **op-node: Unsafe not rewound while `INVALID` during EL Sync:** mslipper commented on issue [#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18125), indicating that this issue can also be punted until the full deprecation of request/response sync.
*   **fusaka-on-l2: finalize design:** mslipper commented on issue [#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/355), stating that the design will be finalized after checking with customers.
