# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing registry management with a new command to remove chain artifacts. Several long-standing issues related to Superchain Registry 2.0 refactoring were closed, and ongoing discussions continued for various technical issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Registry Management Tooling**
    *   Added a new `just remove-chain` command to simplify the process of removing all chain artifacts from the registry, improving operational efficiency ([#1158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1158)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   A new pull request, [#1161](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1161), was opened for an automated codegen update.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Superchain Registry 2.0 Refactor Completions**
    *   Closed issues related to modifying the `add-chain` tool for hardfork opt-in ([#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/610)), investigating L2 key handover tests ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/643)), and updating the `golang-validate-all` CI job for better summary reporting ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/644)). These were addressed by the Superchain Registry 2.0 refactor.
    *   The issue concerning encoding `ProxyAdminOwner` exceptions for Base and Unichain ([#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/675)) was also closed, as it was resolved with the SCR 2.0 update.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Interop and Sync Mechanism Refinements**
    *   Discussions on [#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16140) (Interop: Remove anchor point RPC) and [#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16141) (op-node: Let sync-start not cross into Interop activation) were reopened, with comments highlighting the presence of outstanding TODOs in the code related to these issues.
    *   Issue [#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16174) (op-supervisor: Drop multi-node support) was reopened due to a remaining TODO referencing it.
    *   Issue [#16245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16245) (op-supervisor: remove check-access-list backward compat chainID fallback) was reopened due to existing TODOs in the code.
    *   Issue [#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15817) (op-devstack: sysext: fix address book) was reopened due to several remaining TODOs.
    *   Issue [#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16917) (Clean up Event System Refactor Comments) was reopened due to numerous outstanding TODOs in the code.
*   **EL Sync and Deprecation Considerations**
    *   For [#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17631) (op-node: On the Initial EL Sync UX and Correctness), a comment noted that this issue should be addressed once req/res sync is fully deprecated.
    *   Issues [#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18124) (op-node: Safe Head Advancement during EL Sync) and [#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18125) (op-node: Unsafe not rewound while `INVALID` during EL Sync) were marked as puntable until the full deprecation of RR sync.
*   **Fusaka-on-L2 Design**
    *   Issue [#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/355) (fusaka-on-l2: finalize design) received a comment indicating that the design finalization is pending customer feedback.
