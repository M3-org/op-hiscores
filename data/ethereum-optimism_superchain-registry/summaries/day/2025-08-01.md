### Min Base Fee Tracking and Implementation Progress
Discussion on [#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16807) continues to track the "Min Base Fee" feature. The latest comment from wlawt on August 1st, 2025, at 15:46:47Z, highlights an early reth draft ([https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/17704](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/17704)) for early review and decision-making. This follows a previous comment from wlawt on July 28th, 2025, at 16:19:48Z, which listed other in-flight work related to this feature, including op-alloy ([https://github.com/alloy-rs/op-alloy/pull/580](https://github.com/alloy-rs/op-alloy/pull/580)) and optimism ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16852)) repositories. The issue references the ratified design document ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/295](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/295)).

### Min Base Fee Specification and State Growth Estimation
On the closed issue [#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/742), which focused on writing the specification for the "min-base-fee," a new comment from geoknee on August 1st, 2025, at 21:26:38Z, discussed the need to compute a rough estimate for the state growth implied by this feature. This estimate is intended to be included in the motivation section of the specifications. A subsequent comment from geoknee on August 11th, 2025, at 14:51:01Z, clarified that this state growth estimation was better placed in the FMA and is now being tracked in a separate design document issue ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/316)). The issue was ultimately closed on August 29th, 2025, at 10:29:35Z, via a pull request in the specs repository ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/747](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/747)).
