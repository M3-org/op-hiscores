# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating documentation, enhancing the staging report to include `SystemConfig.minBaseFee`, and performing an automated codegen update. Key updates also include adding `op-contracts/v5.0.0` entries to standard version files.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Staging Report Enhancements and Contract Versioning
The staging report now includes `SystemConfig.minBaseFee` for `op-contracts/v5.0.0` and later, allowing for comparison against standard ranges [#1165](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1165). Additionally, `op-contracts/v5.0.0` entries have been added to the `standard-versions-*.toml` files, mirroring their `op-contracts/v5.0.0-rc.2` counterparts [#1166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1166).

### Automated Code Generation and Documentation Maintenance
An automated codegen update was performed, modifying `addresses.json` [#1167](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1167). Furthermore, broken links within the documentation, specifically in `README.md`, `docs/hardfork-activation-inheritance.md`, and `docs/ops.md`, were updated [#1153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1153).
