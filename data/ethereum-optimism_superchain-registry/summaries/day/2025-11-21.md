# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the Superchain registry's operational reporting capabilities, updating documentation, and performing routine code generation. Key updates include integrating `SystemConfig.minBaseFee` into staging reports and adding new `op-contracts/v5.0.0` entries.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Staging Report and Validation
Improvements were made to the staging report to include `SystemConfig.minBaseFee` for `op-contracts/v5.0.0` and later, allowing for better comparison against standard ranges. Additionally, `op-contracts/v5.0.0` entries were added to the standard version configuration files for both mainnet and Sepolia.

### Routine Maintenance and Documentation
An automated code generation update was performed, affecting the `addresses.json` file. Furthermore, broken links within the project's documentation were identified and updated to ensure accuracy and accessibility.
