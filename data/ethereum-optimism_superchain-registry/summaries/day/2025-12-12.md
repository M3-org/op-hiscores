### Replica Healthcheck for op-rbuilder
Discussion continues on [#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17685), which proposes a dedicated replica-healthcheck for `op-rbuilder` to ensure it does not diverge from `op-geth`. A new comment from "Himess" at 2025-12-12T21:29:19Z indicates interest in taking on this task.
