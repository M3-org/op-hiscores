# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining Superchain configurations by disabling Jovian for several mainnet chains, alongside ongoing discussions and a new pull request to update the `print-staging-report` script for dispute game v2 compatibility.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Configuration Adjustments
Jovian has been disabled for several Conduit mainnet chains, specifically bob, lyra, mint, orderly, and polynomial, while retaining it for mode, metal, and zora. This change also involved updates to `CHAINS.md` and `superchain/extra/addresses/addresses.json`. ([#1151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1151))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#1150](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1150), was opened to update the `print-staging-report` script to support fetching permissioned dispute game parameters from game arguments.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Infrastructure Tooling Deprecation
The issue concerning `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` support for `sysext` was closed due to the deprecation of Kurtosis, the deployment tool mentioned in the issue. ([#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16704))

## NEW ISSUES
- No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Reports
Discussions on [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1148) revolve around updating the `print_staging_report` script to be compatible with dispute game v2. The script currently reads game arguments from the game implementation contract, and the challenge is to adapt this to read from the `gameArgs` storage in the Dispute Game Factory (DGF) if available. There's also a concern about the script's assumption of only a Permissioned and Permissionless game, as the new setup will involve two permissionless games, potentially impacting the JSON output format.

### Kona Prestate Support
Issue [#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18271) tracks the addition of support for embedded custom prestates to Kona. The latest update indicates that a fix is currently under review, with a link provided to the relevant pull request in the `op-rs/kona` repository.
