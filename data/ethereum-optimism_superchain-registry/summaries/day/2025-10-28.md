## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher and AltDA Improvements
- **op-batcher [altda]: should not limit max frame size to max input size in generic mode** ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17796)): Discussion continues on exempting `op-batcher` max frame size from altDA max input size limits in generic commitment mode. A specific commit from `celestiaorg/optimism` has been identified as a potential fix, and a PR is encouraged to merge this solution.
- **Investigate upstreaming Celestia batcher DA size fix** ([#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17872)): This issue is related to [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17796). The proposed fix from Celestia has been reviewed and deemed "good and quite trivial," with a request made for them to open a PR.
