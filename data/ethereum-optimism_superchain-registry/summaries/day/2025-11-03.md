# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on updating Jovian activation timestamps across various Mainnet and Sepolia configurations, alongside an automated codegen update.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Configuration Updates
Configuration files for numerous chains on both Mainnet and Sepolia were updated to push Jovian activation timestamps out by one week. This includes setting `jovian_time` and `superchain_time` to December 2, 2025, for Mainnet chains, and `isthmus_time` for Swell Mainnet. ([#1140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1140))

### Automated Code Generation
An automated code generation update was performed, affecting the `addresses.json` file within the `superchain/extra` directory. ([#1139](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1139))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Test Reporting Refinement
The issue regarding reporting unused acceptance tests ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16273)) was closed. The decision was made as the team has largely transitioned to using gateless mode for tests, rendering the original requirement less relevant.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Documentation
Discussion continues on the documentation for the DA Footprint Limit ([#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1742)). The latest comment suggests tracking this issue concurrently with the documentation of the MinBaseFee feature, noting its self-explanatory nature. The issue emphasizes the importance of documenting risks associated with setting the scalar too high or too low and its interaction with Gas Limit changes.
