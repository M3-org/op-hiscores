# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on updating Jovian activation timestamps across various Mainnet and Sepolia configurations, alongside an automated codegen update.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Configuration Updates
Configuration files for numerous chains on both Mainnet and Sepolia were updated to push Jovian activation timestamps out by one week. This includes setting `jovian_time` and `superchain_time` to December 2, 2025, for Mainnet chains, and `isthmus_time` for Swell Mainnet. ([#1140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1140))

### Automated Code Generation
An automated code generation update was performed, affecting the `addresses.json` file within the `superchain/extra` directory. ([#1139](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1139))

### Test Reporting Refinement
The issue regarding reporting unused acceptance tests ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16273)) was closed, with the rationale that it is no longer needed due to a shift towards primarily using gateless mode for tests.

### DA Footprint Limit Documentation
Discussion on the documentation for the DA Footprint Limit ([#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1742)) suggests that this issue could be tracked concurrently with the documentation of the MinBaseFee feature ([docs#1710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1710)). The latest comment indicates that the topic is considered self-explanatory.
