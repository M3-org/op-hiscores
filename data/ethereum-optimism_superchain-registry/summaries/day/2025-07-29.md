### Congestion-based Builder Transaction Reordering
Discussion on [#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/306) continued with a new comment from `moonfury-ops` at 20:33:56Z, expressing interest in collaborating on the issue with `sebastianst`. The issue proposes writing a design document for congestion-based builder transaction reordering, suggesting tracking DA usage excess over time with an exponential cost/score penalty. This concept could be implemented outside the protocol to test its viability for an L1 congestion cost component.
