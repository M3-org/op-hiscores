# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity primarily involved an automated code generation update. Discussions continued on several active issues, including interop transaction evaluation, node synchronization problems, and testing for Supernodes.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Automated Code Generation
An automated code generation update was merged, modifying the `addresses.json` file within the `superchain/extra` directory. This is a routine update to keep the registry current. ([#1185](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1185))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation of Upgrade Requirements
The issue concerning the documentation of the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades was closed, indicating that the documentation task has been completed. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18095))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop Transaction Evaluation and Rework
Discussions continued on evaluating and reworking injected replacement transactions for interop. The latest comments focused on the necessity of additional transactions for proof systems, with ajsutton highlighting their criticality for preventing honest challengers from being overwhelmed. rdin777 summarized the consensus towards simplifying the protocol by eliminating the extra deposit transaction for proofs, suggesting an architectural refactoring and an update to the Interop specification. ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18574))

### Node Synchronization Issues
The issue regarding nodes not synchronizing saw further comments. yaki-1337 confirmed using a full node without an archive and op-geth, and inquired about downloading OP-GETH or switching to Reth after deleting everything. rdin777 provided troubleshooting advice, suggesting the "missing trie node" error indicates an incomplete or corrupted state database and asked for more details on the node configuration and logs. ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581))

### Reworking Proofs Action Testing for Supernodes
Discussions on reworking proofs action testing to support Supernodes continued. ajsutton emphasized that `op-challenger` in production gets data from Supernode, implying tests should mirror this. Inphi noted that while action tests might be overkill for testing only the proof program, they might be necessary for `op-challenger` interop testing, especially for intrusive scenarios like consolidation. ([#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18621))

### File-Relative Paths vs. Project-Relative Paths
The discussion on using file-relative paths instead of project-relative paths continued. manu-qiro confirmed that context-aware remappings solved the issue for them, referencing a previous suggestion by alexkeating. ([#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/10202))
