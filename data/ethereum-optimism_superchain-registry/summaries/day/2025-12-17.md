# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on routine automated updates to the `superchain-registry`, alongside ongoing discussions on critical technical issues including interop transaction evaluation, node synchronization problems, and the re-evaluation of proofs action testing for Supernodes.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Automated Registry Update**
    *   A daily automated codegen update was merged, modifying `addresses.json` within the `superchain/extra` directory. ([#1185](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1185))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Documentation of Cannon-Kona Prestate Requirement**
    *   The issue regarding documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades was closed, indicating that the documentation team has been informed and is addressing this. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18095))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx** ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18574))
    *   Discussions continued regarding simplifying the interop specification by removing the additional replacement transaction. The latest comments suggest alignment on this simplification, particularly noting that the replacement transaction provides no value in a ZK dispute system. Concerns about the downsides of the Supernode just recording data (lack of consensus check, data availability issues) were raised but deemed less critical with ZK proofs. The next steps involve assigning someone for architectural refactoring and updating the Interop specification.

*   **The Node is Not Synchronized** ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581))
    *   Users are experiencing `missing trie node` and `Failed to build payload` errors, indicating potential state database corruption or incompleteness. The latest comments confirm the use of a full node (not archive) and OP-GETH, with no improper shutdowns. The user is now looking for where to download OP-GETH or considering switching to Reth, having deleted everything. Previous suggestions included checking for unclean shutdowns, using `--syncmode=full`, and ensuring sufficient disk IOPS.

*   **SPIKE: Rework Proofs Action Testing to Support Supernodes** ([#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18621))
    *   The discussion revolves around adapting action testing for the Supernode architecture. Key questions include how to test the actual Supernode implementation and whether the current action test framework is suitable. There's a strong sentiment that challenger tests should run against a "real" Supernode to accurately test interactions. While action tests might be overkill for just testing the proof program, their value for testing `op-challenger` in interop scenarios, especially with the intrusiveness required for scenario generation, is being considered.

*   **Use File-Relative Paths Instead of Project-Relative** ([#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/10202))
    *   The discussion on using file-relative paths for imports continued, with a recent comment from `manu-qiro` confirming that "context aware remappings" solved the issue for them, thanking `alexkeating` for the suggestion. Earlier comments highlighted that project-relative paths, while part of the style guide for easier refactoring, can cause issues with tools like Remix and Foundry due to translation overhead for importers.
