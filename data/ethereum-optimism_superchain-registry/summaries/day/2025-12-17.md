# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity primarily involved an automated codegen update to the `addresses.json` file. Discussions continued on several active issues, including interop transaction evaluation, node synchronization problems, and testing for Supernodes.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Automated Code Generation Update
An automated daily job updated the `addresses.json` file within the `superchain/extra` directory. This routine update ensures the registry remains current with the latest configurations. ([#1185](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1185))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation of Cannon-Kona Prestate Requirement
The issue concerning the documentation of the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades was closed as completed. This indicates that the necessary documentation has been added or updated. ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18095))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop Transaction Evaluation and Rework ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18574))
Discussion continued regarding the evaluation and rework of injected replacement transactions for interop. The latest comments from @ajsutton highlighted two downsides to having the Supernode just record data: lack of consensus-based accuracy checks and data availability issues if derivation is not run locally. @ajsutton also noted that these concerns might be less significant with ZK proofs, as proof generation would re-run the derivation process. @rdin777 summarized a consensus to simplify the protocol by removing the additional deposit transaction for proofs and requested assignment for architectural refactoring and an update to the Interop specification.

### Node Synchronization Issues ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581))
The issue of nodes not synchronizing, often due to "missing trie node" errors, saw further comments. @yaki-1337 confirmed using a full node without an archive, no improper shutdowns, and OP-GETH. They inquired about downloading OP-GETH or switching to Reth after deleting everything. @rdin777 provided troubleshooting steps, suggesting the error indicates an incomplete or corrupted state database and asked for clarification on node type, shutdown history, and execution client.

### Reworking Proofs Action Testing for Supernodes ([#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18621))
Discussions on reworking proofs action testing to support Supernodes continued. @ajsutton emphasized that challenger tests should run against a real Supernode to accurately test the interaction between the challenger and Supernode, as production data comes solely from the Supernode. @ajsutton also suggested that if a better approach for testing Supernode scenarios exists, rewriting proofs tests to align with it would be beneficial, especially given the shortcomings of the current action test framework. @Inphi agreed that action tests might be overkill for testing only the proof program but expressed less certainty for testing `op-challenger` for interop, noting the intrusiveness required for test setup scenarios.

### Use File-Relative Paths Instead of Project-Relative ([#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/10202))
The discussion around using file-relative paths instead of project-relative paths saw a new comment from @manu-qiro, who thanked @alexkeating and confirmed that context-aware remappings solved their issue. This suggests a potential solution for the problems caused by project-relative paths in various development environments.
