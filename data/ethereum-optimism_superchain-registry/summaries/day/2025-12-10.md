### Investigating `op-node` Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug
Discussions continued on a possible bug in the `op-node` sequencer recovery mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18350)). The latest comment suggests a potentially relevant PR ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)) for further investigation. Previous comments highlighted that when the sequencer is in recovery mode during normal operation, it might request a non-existent L1 origin block, leading to "not found" errors and potential violations of the sequencer drift rule. This could cause derivation stalls if a bad batch gets on L1, with recovery options including rewinding the sequencer or allowing reorgs. The influence of async L1 origin fetching (from PR [#12134](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/12134)) is also being investigated as a potential factor.
