# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity primarily involved an automated codegen update, ensuring the registry remains current. Discussions continued on an active issue concerning a potential bug in `op-node` sequencer recovery mode.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Automated Registry Updates
An automated codegen update was performed, modifying `chainList.json` and `chainList.toml` to keep the superchain registry current. This routine maintenance ensures the accuracy of chain data. ([#1178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1178))

### Investigating `op-node` Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug
Discussions continued on a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer recovery mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18350)). The latest comment suggests a possibly relevant PR ([#18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)) in the `optimism` repository. Previous discussions highlighted that when the sequencer is in recovery mode during normal operation, it might request a non-existent L1 origin block, leading to "not found" errors and potentially violating the sequencer drift rule. This can cause derivation stalls if a bad batch gets on L1. A potential fix snippet was also shared to prevent temporary errors in recovery mode when it catches up to the tip. The investigation is ongoing to understand why temporary errors persist and how async L1 origin fetching might influence the behavior.
