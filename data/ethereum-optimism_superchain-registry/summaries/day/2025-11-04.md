## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Addressing "Backwards Time Travel" in Proxyd
Discussions on [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/501) focused on potential solutions for Proxyd returning previous blocks if backends are out of sync. Brainstormed ideas include a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, Proxyd handling "block out of range" errors by falling back to other backends, IP-based sticky sessions, and signature-based sticky sessions. Concerns were raised about the impact of "backwards time travel" on other RPC methods like `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory`.

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking for op-batcher/txmgr
The issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18102) discusses the need for blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr`. A suggestion was made to have the starting priority fee for new transactions "decay" from the previous transaction rather than always resetting, which could improve backlog handling during busy periods. However, it was noted that a dedicated blob priority fee tracker would provide a more robust solution, especially after batcher restarts.

### Update `migrate` method
Issue [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17743) is being tracked for OPCM changes related to the `migrate` method. It was clarified that this issue specifically covers OPCM updates, with devstack changes being tracked separately in another issue. The issue is expected to be closed soon.
