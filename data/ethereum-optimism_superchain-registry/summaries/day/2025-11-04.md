# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating prestate and version configurations, alongside a minor update to the daily codegen PR message. Discussions on active issues covered `op-acceptance-tests`, `migrate` method updates, blob priority fee tracking, and `proxyd`'s time travel problem.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Configuration Updates for Optimism Protocol:**
    *   Added `op-program` v1.8.0-rc.4 prestate to `standard-prestates.toml` ([#1142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1142)).
    *   Updated MIPS and OPCM deployments in `standard-versions-mainnet.toml` and `standard-versions-sepolia.toml` ([#1141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1141)).

*   **Developer Tooling Enhancements:**
    *   Improved the daily codegen PR message to include information about files to check ([#1143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1143)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **`op-acceptance-tests`: sysgo to support flashblocks / rbuilders** ([#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16450)):
    *   The latest comment indicates a desire to implement this to validate the `kona-node` and `rollup-boost` changes.

*   **Update `migrate` method** ([#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17743)):
    *   Discussion clarifies that this issue specifically tracks OPCM changes, with devstack changes being handled in a separate issue. The latest comment suggests this issue could be closed soon.

*   **`op-batcher/txmgr`: Blob priority fee tracking** ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18102)):
    *   The discussion revolves around improving blob priority fee estimation. A suggestion was made to have the starting priority fee "decay" from the previous transaction, which could be a simpler implementation for handling backlogs. The latest comment acknowledges this as a potential special case but notes its downside of resetting after a restart, contrasting it with a more comprehensive blob priority fee tracker.

*   **`proxyd`: backwards time travel is possible when backends are not in sync** ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/501)):
    *   The latest comments explore various approaches to mitigate "backwards time travel" in `proxyd`. Suggestions include a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call`, `proxyd` being aware of "block out of range" errors, and sticky sessions (IP-based or signature-based). Concerns were raised about the impact of "backwards time travel" on `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory`.
