## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-challenger: Trace Output Review
Discussion continues on [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18643) regarding the `op-challenger`'s trace output when the next super root is not found. The latest comment confirms that the super node trace provider now handles this correctly. While `op-supervisor` won't be fixed due to its impending deletion, the issue remains open pending an integration test to confirm `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments highlighted a potential problem with `op-program` transitioning to an invalid hash with insufficient data and questioned the correctness of a specific test in the `super` provider.
