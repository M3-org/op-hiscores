## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-challenger`: Review correct trace output when next super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18643))
The discussion on this issue revolves around the correct behavior of `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found. The latest comment confirms that the super node trace provider now handles this correctly. While `op-supervisor` won't be fixed due to its impending deletion, the issue remains open pending an integration test to confirm `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments highlighted that `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash with insufficient data and questioned the correctness of a specific test in the super root provider. There was also a note that the `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC returns a "not found" error if any chain isn't supported by L1, even if the supervisor's superroot RPC can return super roots for non-cross-safe blocks.
