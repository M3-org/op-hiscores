([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16688))

## NEW ISSUES
### Missing Test Logs in `op-acceptance-tests`
A new issue was opened regarding missing test logs in `op-acceptance-tests` within a specific CI run. Despite multiple test failures, the logs were not readily available. ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17151))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Missing Test Logs in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17151))
This issue, opened today, highlights that a CI run reported failed tests but lacked corresponding logs. A comment from scharissis clarified that the "go-tests-short" workflow job is not intended for acceptance tests and that the few sysgo acceptance tests it runs are not executed via `op-acceptor`, which would capture logs. They are actively working on moving these tests, which is expected to resolve the issue. The issue was later closed on Aug 25, 2025, with a comment indicating the logs were found in one of the root logs.
