# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 11, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on expanding Superchain support with the addition of Celo Sepolia and refining game type logic to include KONA for permissionless chain identification.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Configuration Updates
- Added Celo Sepolia to the Superchain registry, including its configuration files and updated chain lists, expanding the Superchain ecosystem [#1116](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1116).

### Game Type Logic Enhancement
- Updated the `codegen.go` logic to recognize KONA (game type 8) alongside CANNON (game type 1) as valid game types for marking chains as permissionless in `chainList.json` [#1179](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1179).

### Node Synchronization Problems
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581) reports that nodes are not synchronizing, with errors like "missing trie node... is not available" and "Failed to build payload." Users are experiencing this across Base, Optimism, and Unichain, particularly when syncing with snapshots from publicnode.com. There's speculation that a client update might be needed. A user noted that `snapsync` with `--syncmode=execution-layer` worked for a new Unichain node. The maintainer has requested detailed client configurations, full logs for Op-Node and L1 Execution Client, and startup flags for all three clients to diagnose the issue.
