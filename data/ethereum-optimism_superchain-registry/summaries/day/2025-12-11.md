# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 11, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on expanding Superchain registry support with the addition of Celo Sepolia and refining game type logic to include KONA for permissionless chain identification.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Registry Expansion
- Added Celo Sepolia to the Superchain registry, including its configuration and genesis files, expanding the network's interoperability. ([#1116](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1116))

### Game Type Logic Update
- Updated the logic for generating `chainList.json` to recognize chains using game type 8 (KONA-CANNON) as permissionless, alongside existing game type 1 (CANNON). ([#1179](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1179))

### Node Synchronization Problems
The issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581) reports that nodes are not synchronizing, with errors like "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload." Users are experiencing this across various chains including Base, Optimism, and Unichain, often when syncing with snapshots. There's speculation that a client update might be needed. A user noted that `snapsync` with `--syncmode=execution-layer` worked for a new Unichain node, suggesting potential issues with Publicnode snapshots. The latest comment from rdin777 requests detailed information on client configurations (L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client), full logs for Op-Node and L1 Execution Client, and startup flags for all three clients to diagnose the problem.
