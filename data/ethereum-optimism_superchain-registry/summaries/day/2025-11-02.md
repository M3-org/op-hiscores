### Blob Priority Fee Tracking Discussion
Discussion continued on [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18102) regarding blob priority fee tracking. A comment from ajsutton suggested a potential quick win to have the starting priority fee for new transactions "decay" from the previous transaction rather than always starting at the set minimum. This could help the batcher handle backlogs more effectively during busy periods.
