## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Blob Priority Fee Tracking in op-batcher/txmgr
Discussion continued on issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18102), which addresses blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr`. A new comment from ajsutton suggested a potential "quick win" for ensuring transaction inclusion: allowing the starting priority fee for new transactions to "decay" from the previous transaction's fee, rather than always resetting to the minimum. This approach aims to improve how the batcher handles backlogs during busy periods, even if it's not as comprehensive as other solutions.
