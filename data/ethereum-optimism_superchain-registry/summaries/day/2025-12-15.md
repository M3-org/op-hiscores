# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on Superchain configuration updates, specifically activating hardforks for Cyber and Funki Mainnets, and adding a new Kona version to standard prestates.
## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
### Superchain Hardfork Activations
Hardforks were activated for Cyber Mainnet, including Fjord, Granite, and Holocene, with specific activation times set for early January 2026. Similarly, Granite and Holocene hardforks were activated for Funki Mainnet, scheduled for early January 2026. ([#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1183), [#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1182))

### Standard Prestate Updates
Kona version 1.2.7 was added to the `standard-prestates.toml` file, noting the absence of a 1.2.6 release. ([#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1184))
## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Fault Proof System Testing
Issue [#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17348), "Run precompile FP tests on Jovian fork," was closed and then reopened due to an outstanding TODO in the code.
## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.
## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Interoperability and Replacement Transactions
Discussion on [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18574) "interop: evaluate and rework injected replacement Tx" centered on the necessity of additional transactions for proof systems. While the Supernode could potentially generate needed proof data, the additional transaction recording the block hash is considered critical for the proofs system to prevent overwhelming honest challengers. The fixed gas cost of the inserted transaction and existing gas reserves mitigate concerns about exceeding block gas limits.

### Node Synchronization Issues
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581) "the node is not synchronized" received further comments. The user reported "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors, indicating the L1 Execution Client might not be providing necessary state data. A request was made for more information on client configurations, full logs, and startup flags to aid in diagnosis.

### `op-challenger` Panic on BlobBaseFee
On [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18608) "op-challenger: : invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference", a user reported a panic in `op-challenger` when the L1 does not support `blobBaseFee`. This is likely due to `op-challenger` attempting to access an uninitialized `BlobBaseFee` field. Further information was requested regarding the `op-challenger` version, L1 Execution Client, and L1 network configuration to investigate the metric initialization.

### `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` Fuzzing Test Failure
Issue [#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18554) "`_7702Target = address(0)` will result in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` fuzzing test failure" highlighted a critical bug where `_7702Target = address(0)` causes a failure in fuzzing tests. This indicates a potential issue with handling deposits involving the null address and its impact on aliasing. Immediate prioritization as a critical bug and assignment to a contracts developer was suggested to address the logical error.

### `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` Connection Flakiness
The discussion on [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18570) "chore(sysgo/p2p): fix op-reth <-> op-geth connection flakiness" addressed P2P connection instability in system tests. This issue, affecting mixes of `op-geth/op-reth` nodes, was deemed critical for client ecosystem health. It was suggested to classify this as a major bug and assign it to someone capable of investigating the P2P implementation differences and `admin_peers` encoding.

### Kona-sp1 Optimization for ZK Proofs
On [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18533) "kona-sp1: Ensure expensive operations are offloaded to the host", the discussion focused on optimizing `kona-sp1` for ZK Proofs by offloading expensive operations like `keccak` and `sha2` to the host. Questions were raised about identifying all code areas requiring offloading and if other computationally intensive operations might need a similar approach.

### Finalizing U18 Releases
Issue [#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18548) "Finalize U18 releases" is tracking the finalization of Upgrade 18. An update was requested on the status of governance approval for `op-program` and any critical issues found during testnet operation that could block or delay the U18 release.
