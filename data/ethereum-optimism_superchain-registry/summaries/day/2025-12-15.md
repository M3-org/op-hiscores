# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on Superchain configuration updates, specifically activating hardforks for Cyber and Funki Mainnets, and adding a new Kona version to standard prestates.
## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
### Superchain Hardfork Activations
Hardforks were activated for Cyber Mainnet, including Fjord, Granite, and Holocene, with specific activation times set for early January 2026. Similarly, Granite and Holocene hardforks were activated for Funki Mainnet, scheduled for early January 2026. ([#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1183), [#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1182))

### Standard Prestate Updates
Kona version 1.2.7 was added to the `standard-prestates.toml` file, noting the absence of a 1.2.6 release. ([#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1184))
## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Fault Proof System Testing
Issue [#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17348) "Run precompile FP tests on Jovian fork" was closed and then reopened due to an outstanding TODO in the code.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Interoperability and Replacement Transactions
Discussion on [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18574) "interop: evaluate and rework injected replacement Tx" centered on the necessity of additional transactions for proof systems. While the Supernode could potentially generate needed proof data, the additional transaction recording the block hash is considered critical for the proofs system to prevent overwhelming honest challengers. The fixed gas cost of the inserted transaction and existing gas reserves mitigate concerns about exceeding block gas limits.

### Node Synchronization Issues
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581) "the node is not synchronized" highlighted problems with missing trie nodes and failed payload builds, suggesting L1 Execution Client data issues. The latest comments requested detailed environment information, including client configurations, full logs, and startup flags, to aid in diagnosis. One user reported success with snapsync using `--syncmode=execution-layer` for a new Unichain node.

### `op-challenger` Panic on BlobBaseFee
Issue [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18608) "op-challenger: : invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference" reported a panic when the L1 does not support `blobBaseFee`. The latest comments confirmed the issue likely stems from `op-challenger` attempting to access an uninitialized `BlobBaseFee` field. The reporter provided their `op-challenger` version (untagged-09dfe35b-1748891588) and Geth version (v1.13.15) and confirmed the L1 is a local private chain not upgraded to Dencun, thus lacking Blob transaction support.

### `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` Fuzzing Test Failure
Issue [#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18554) "`_7702Target = address(0)` will result in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` fuzzing test failure" describes a critical bug where `_7702Target = address(0)` causes a failure. The latest comment emphasized the severity of the bug, suggesting it indicates incorrect behavior when handling deposits with a null address and its impact on aliasing. Immediate prioritization, bug/critical/security labeling, and assignment to a contract developer were recommended to fix the logical error in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction`.

### `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` Connection Flakiness
Issue [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18570) "chore(sysgo/p2p): fix op-reth <-> op-geth connection flakiness" addresses P2P connection instability in system tests. The latest comment suggested classifying this as a major bug or high-priority chore due to its impact on test stability and potential production compatibility. It was recommended to assign someone to investigate the P2P implementation differences between `op-reth` and `op-geth` and verify `admin_peers` encoding.

### Kona-sp1 Optimization for ZK Proofs
Issue [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18533) "kona-sp1: Ensure expensive operations are offloaded to the host" discusses optimizing `kona-sp1` for ZK Proofs by offloading expensive operations. The latest comment inquired about progress in identifying all code areas where `keccak` and `sha2` (and other expensive operations) are executed outside the EVM and require offloading via syscall, and whether other computationally expensive operations might need a similar approach.

### Finalizing U18 Releases
Issue [#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18548) "Finalize U18 releases" tracks the finalization of Upgrade 18. The latest comment requested an update on the status of governance approval for `op-program` and any critical issues found on the testnet that could block or delay the U18 release finalization.
