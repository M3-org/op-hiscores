# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on updating hardfork activations for Cyber and Funki Mainnets and adding a new Kona version to standard prestates.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Hardfork Activations
Hardforks were activated for Cyber Mainnet, including Fjord, Granite, and Holocene, and for Funki Mainnet, activating Granite and Holocene. These updates ensure the Superchain configurations are current with the latest protocol upgrades.
- [#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1183)
- [#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1182)

### Standard Prestate Updates
Kona version 1.2.7 was added to the `standard-prestates.toml` file, reflecting an update in the standard prestate configurations.
- [#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1184)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Fault Proof System Error
A new issue was reported regarding an `op-challenger` panic due to an "invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference" when the L1 does not support `blobBaseFee`. This suggests a potential need for logic to handle L1s without blob support.
- [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18608)

### Kona Interop Action Tests
An issue was opened to ensure that Kona interop action tests are not disabled, indicating a focus on maintaining and verifying interoperability.
- [#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18613)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona-sp1 Optimization for ZK Proofs
Discussion on [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18533) centered on optimizing `kona-sp1` for ZK Proofs by offloading expensive operations like `keccak` and `sha2` to the host. The latest comment from rdin777 inquired about the progress in identifying all such operations and if other computationally intensive operations might require a similar approach.

### Finalizing U18 Releases
Issue [#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18548) concerns the finalization of Upgrade 18 releases. rdin777 requested an update on the status of governance approval for `op-program` and any critical issues found on the testnet that could block or delay the finalization.

### `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` Fuzzing Test Failure
The bug described in [#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18554), where `_7702Target = address(0)` causes a fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction`, was highlighted by rdin777 as critical. They suggested prioritizing the issue with `bug` and `critical` labels and assigning a contract developer to address the logical error in handling empty bytes.

### `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` Connection Flakiness
Issue [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18570) addresses P2P connection flakiness between `op-reth` and `op-geth` in system tests. rdin777 recommended classifying this as a major bug or high-priority chore and assigning someone to investigate the P2P implementation differences and `admin_peers` encoding.

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx
The discussion on [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18574) revolves around the necessity and design of injected replacement transactions for invalid interop transactions. Inphi suggested simplifying the protocol by not adding the extra deposit transaction, while axelKingsley questioned if the Supernode could provide the necessary data for proof without needing to pull it from the block. ajsutton emphasized the critical role of the additional transaction for the proofs system to prevent overwhelming honest challengers and noted that there's no real risk of exceeding the block gas limit.

### Node Synchronization Issues
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581) reports problems with node synchronization, specifically "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. rdin777 requested more information on the L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client, full logs for Op-Node and L1 Execution Client, and the full list of startup flags for all three clients to aid in diagnosis.

### `op-challenger`: Invalid Memory Address or Nil Pointer Dereference
On [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18608), a `nil pointer dereference` error in `RecordBlobBaseFee` was reported. lyh169 provided details on their setup (op-challenger version untagged-09dfe35b-1748891588, geth v1.13.15, local private chain not upgraded to Dencun). They suggested that `op-challenger` might need a flag similar to `op-batch` (`--data-availability-type=calldata`) to prevent panics when the L1 does not support blob transactions. rdin777 acknowledged the severity and requested further details on the L1 client and configuration to investigate the initialization of `txmgr` metrics.
