# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating hardfork configurations for Cyber and Funki Mainnets, alongside adding a new Kona version to standard prestates. Several critical issues were actively discussed, covering topics from op-challenger panics to node synchronization problems and interop transaction evaluations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Hardfork Activations
Hardforks were activated for Cyber Mainnet, including Fjord, Granite, and Holocene, with specific activation times set for early January 2026. Similarly, Granite and Holocene hardforks were activated for Funki Mainnet, scheduled for early January 2026. ([#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1183), [#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1182))

### Kona Prestate Update
Kona version 1.2.7 was added to the `standard-prestates.toml` file. ([#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1184))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Fault Proof System Testing
The issue regarding running precompile FP tests on the Jovian fork was closed and then reopened, indicating ongoing work and a remaining TODO in the code. ([#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17348))

## NEW ISSUES
### Kona Interop Test Disablement
A new issue was opened to ensure that Kona interop action tests are not disabled, indicating a need to get these tests working. ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18613))

### op-challenger Panic
A critical issue was reported where `op-challenger` experienced a panic due to an invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference, likely related to L1 not supporting `blobBaseFee`. ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18608))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona-SP1 Optimization for ZK Proofs ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18533))
Discussion centered on optimizing `kona-sp1` for ZK Proofs by offloading expensive operations like `keccak` and `sha2` to the host. A user inquired about the progress in identifying all code areas requiring syscall offloading and if other cryptographic operations might need similar treatment.

### Finalizing U18 Releases ([#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18548))
An update was requested on the status of Upgrade 18 (U18) releases, specifically regarding governance approval for `op-program` and any critical issues found during testnet runs that could block finalization.

### `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` Fuzzing Test Failure ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18554))
A critical bug report highlighted a fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when `_7702Target = address(0)`. The discussion emphasized the severity of the issue, suggesting immediate prioritization, labeling as critical/security, and assigning a contract developer to fix the logical error related to etching empty bytes.

### `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` Connection Flakiness ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18570))
The discussion focused on P2P connection instability in system tests when mixing `op-geth` and `op-reth` nodes. It was suggested to classify this as a major bug or high-priority chore and assign someone to investigate the P2P implementation differences and `admin_peers` encoding.

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18574))
The conversation revolved around simplifying the interop protocol by potentially eliminating the additional deposit transaction for proofs. While the additional transaction is deemed critical for the proofs system to avoid overwhelming honest challengers, there's a consensus that the Supernode should be able to generate necessary data without an extra deposit. The proposed action is to assign someone for architectural refactoring and update the Interop specification.

### Node Synchronization Issues ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581))
Users reported issues with nodes not synchronizing, displaying errors like "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload." The discussion requested more information on client configurations (L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client), full logs, and startup flags to diagnose the problem, which often points to the L1 Execution Client failing to provide necessary state data.
