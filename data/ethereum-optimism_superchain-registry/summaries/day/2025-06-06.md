# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Jun 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on re-enabling EthLockboxProxy consistency validation and refining CircleCI workflows for webhook triggers. A new pull request was opened to remove CGT-related code.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Dependency and Configuration Updates:** Re-enabled EthLockboxProxy consistency validation by updating `op-fetcher` and regenerating codegen files, ensuring data integrity across the Superchain registry. ([#1071](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1071))
*   **CI/CD Workflow Improvements:** Modified the CircleCI configuration to ensure the `notify-when-chain-is-added-to-registry` workflow only triggers on webhook events, optimizing CI/CD processes. ([#1073](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1073))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#1074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1074), was opened to remove CGT-related code, indicating potential cleanup or deprecation of certain functionalities.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **`op-supervisor`: Fix ability to provide data for fault proofs with non-genesis interop** ([#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16166)): Discussion continues on how to handle pre-interop super roots for fault proofs. Options include the `op-challenger` manually constructing roots or the `op-supervisor` indexing the safe DB from the first derived block. The latest comment suggests that removing the `op-node`'s safe DB for managed nodes would be beneficial.

*   **`op-supervisor`: Improve L1 origin validity handling during resets** ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16315)): The issue discusses improving the supervisor's reset logic to validate the L1 origin of target blocks. The latest comments suggest that the supervisor should ideally only provide valid targets, and if a target is invalid, another reset should be initiated. This would simplify the `op-node`'s logic by avoiding redundant validity checks and walkbacks.

*   **`eth_getTransactionCount` returns incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending txs** ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/623)): Users are reporting that the Base node returns an incorrect nonce for pending transactions, causing transactions to get stuck. The latest comment from `mukul3097` on June 6th, 2025, asks for an update on the issue, indicating it remains unresolved and is impacting users.
