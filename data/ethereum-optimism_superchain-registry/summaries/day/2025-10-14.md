# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Oct 14, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on improving CI error messages for better debugging. Discussions continued on an active issue regarding `op-dispute-mon`'s handling of out-of-sync nodes.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD Enhancements
*   Improved CI error messages for duplicate chain names and IDs to provide more detailed debugging information ([#1118](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1118)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Flashblocks Proxy Resolution
*   An issue with flashblocks being lost when forwarding from rollup-boost to RPC nodes was identified and fixed, attributed to connectivity issues and subscriber pong timeouts in the flashblocks-websocket-proxy ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17856)).
*   Coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers regarding the new Flashblocks RPC node was completed, with most providers confirming the upgrade ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17857)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-dispute-mon` Sync Handling
Discussion continued on fixing `op-dispute-mon`'s handling of out-of-sync nodes ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17814)). The latest comments suggest that while a proposed solution in PR #17819 will reduce the problem, a general solution might involve using `syncStatus` to determine the expected current L2 head and ignore results from nodes that are behind. There was also a point about not necessarily trusting the highest L2 block as correct, as it could be from a node that followed an incorrect fork, and instead focusing on `CurrentL1` from the sync status. The issue was briefly closed by mistake and then reopened.
