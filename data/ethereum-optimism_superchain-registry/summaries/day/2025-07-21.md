# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Jul 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on expanding the Superchain Registry by re-adding Celo mainnet, including necessary adjustments for its unique genesis history. Additionally, several issues related to flashblocks enablement and supervisor improvements were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Registry Expansion
Celo mainnet was re-added to the Superchain Registry, with specific handling for its genesis validity check due to its history as an Ethereum L1 fork converted to an L2. This update involved modifications to `CHAINS.md`, `chainList.json`, `chainList.toml`, `ops/cmd/check_genesis_integrity/main.go`, `superchain/configs/mainnet/celo.toml`, `superchain/extra/addresses/addresses.json`, and `superchain/extra/genesis/mainnet/celo.json.zst`. ([#1086](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1086))
