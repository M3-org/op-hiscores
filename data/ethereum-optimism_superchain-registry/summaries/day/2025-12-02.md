# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 2, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity primarily involved an automated code generation update to `addresses.json` and the opening of a new pull request to support embedded contract artifacts in the 'add chain' operation. Discussions continued on existing issues related to `op-node` invalid block signatures and `proxyd`'s potential for "backwards time travel."

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Automated Code Generation Update
An automated update to the `superchain/extra/addresses/addresses.json` file was performed, ensuring the registry remains current with the latest generated code. This is part of routine maintenance to keep the Superchain Registry up-to-date. ([#1171](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1171))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#1172](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1172), was opened to enhance the 'add chain' operation by supporting embedded contract artifacts.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node` Invalid Block Signature ([#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17448))
A user reported encountering an "op-node invalid block signature unrecognized signer" error during testnet deployment. Another user, `lyh169`, commented on December 2, 2025, stating they are experiencing the same problem and are seeking a solution.

### `proxyd` Backwards Time Travel ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/501))
Discussion continued regarding the `proxyd` issue where it can return previous blocks as `unsafe` if backends are out of sync. On December 2, 2025, `yashvardhan-kukreja` provided an update, stating plans to focus on this issue from January 1st onwards (during their next on-call). `joshklop` acknowledged the update, expressing no additional concerns at the moment. Earlier discussions included brainstorming various approaches to address the problem, such as a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call`, `proxyd` awareness of "block out of range" errors, IP-based sticky sessions, and signature-based sticky sessions, each with their own pros and cons.
