# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 19, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on updating configuration parameters for minimum base fees on both mainnet and Sepolia, alongside routine automated codegen updates. An issue related to `min-base-fee` simulations was closed, while new discussions emerged regarding `cannonKonaPrestate` documentation and `op-program` compatibility with Go 1.25.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Configuration Parameter Updates
*   Bounds for the minimum base fee were added to the standard configuration for mainnet and Sepolia, enhancing protocol security and stability. ([#1127](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1127), [#1163](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1163))

### Automated Code Generation
*   Routine automated codegen updates were performed for November 18th and 19th, ensuring the registry remains up-to-date. ([#1161](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1161), [#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1162))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Documenting `cannonKonaPrestate` Requirement ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18095))
Discussion continues on documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for standard chains, particularly in the context of the U18 upgrade. The docs team has received a one-pager mentioning this need, and a suitable location within the Optimism documentation is being sought.

### `op-program`: Fixing `vm-compat` for Go 1.25 ([#18334](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18334))
A new issue was raised regarding the `vm-compat` program failing to analyze Go 1.25 binaries due to an unhandled modification of a register in an r-type instruction. A potential hacky fix involving modifications to `mips_parser.go` and `main.go` was shared, indicating an ongoing effort to resolve this compatibility problem.
