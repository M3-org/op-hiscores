# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining configuration parameters, specifically adding bounds for minimum base fees in standard configurations for both mainnet and Sepolia. Automated codegen updates also occurred, ensuring the registry remains current.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Configuration Parameter Refinements
Bounds for the minimum base fee were added to the standard configuration for mainnet and Sepolia, enhancing protocol security and stability. This ensures that the base fee remains within acceptable limits.
- Added minimum base fee bounds to the standard mainnet configuration ([#1127](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1127)).
- Incorporated minimum base fee bounds into the Sepolia configuration ([#1163](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1163)).

### Automated Code Generation Updates
Routine automated updates to the codebase were performed, ensuring the registry's data and structure are consistently up-to-date.
- Automated codegen update for November 18, 2025 ([#1161](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1161)).
- Automated codegen update for November 19, 2025 ([#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1162)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Minimum Base Fee Feature Evaluation
The issue concerning simulations to prove the effectiveness of the minimum base fee feature was closed. The current approach is to observe the feature's performance in a production environment.
- min-base-fee: conduct simulations which prove effectiveness of the feature ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16958)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Documentation of `cannonKonaPrestate` Requirement
Discussion continues on documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades. The latest update indicates that the docs team has received a one-pager mentioning the need to provide a Kona prestate, suggesting progress towards formalizing this requirement for standard chains. This is particularly relevant for the upcoming U18 upgrade.
- Document cannonKonaPrestate requirement for upgrades ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18095)).
