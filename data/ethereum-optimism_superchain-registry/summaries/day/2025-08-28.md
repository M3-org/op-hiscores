## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Registry Expansion
A new testnet, Arena Z, was added to the Superchain Registry, including its configuration, chain list entries, and genesis data. This expands the available testing environments within the Superchain ecosystem. ([#1092](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1092))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## NEW ISSUES
### CI/CD Enhancements
A new issue was opened to discuss running the monorepo CI suite on `op-geth` PRs to ensure comprehensive end-to-end testing and prevent regressions. ([#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/665))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Documentation for Rollup Testnet Deployment
Discussions on [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1530) revolve around improving the documentation for creating an OP Stack Rollup testnet using `op-deployer`. The latest comment from krofax indicates a "rich PR" is in progress to overhaul the existing documentation, suggesting significant updates are coming to clarify the process for external chain operators. Earlier comments highlighted confusion due to mixed-up old and new deployment methods and the high volume of RPC calls observed when using the permissioned fault-proof system.

### Flashblock Tests for Persistent Devnets
Issue [#17248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17248) focuses on enabling flashblock tests against persistent devnets. The latest comment from Stevmark11 reiterates the need to enable these tests, noting that the necessary gate is in place and primarily requires verification of correct functionality. This is categorized as a small task.

### Monorepo CI for op-geth PRs
On [#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/665), the discussion centers on ensuring the monorepo CI runs for `op-geth` PRs to catch issues early. Ajsutton suggested an alternative: a periodic job in the monorepo that checks for the latest `op-geth` commit and alerts if it fails. This approach aims to quickly identify integration problems, though it might produce false alarms if the job runs between `op-geth` and monorepo PR merges.
