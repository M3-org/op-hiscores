# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Oct 31, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining CI/CD processes, specifically adjusting CircleCI notifications for daily codegen. A significant number of older issues were closed, indicating a cleanup of the issue backlog, particularly those related to validation, configuration, and testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD Enhancements
- Adjusted CircleCI configuration to ping the secondary on-call engineer instead of the primary for daily codegen tasks, optimizing notification routing ([#1136](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1136)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#1135](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1135) chore: automated codegen update 2025-10-31: This pull request introduces an automated codegen update.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Validation and Configuration Refinements
- Several issues related to ensuring the accuracy and completeness of contract lists and roles were closed, including keeping contract and role lists up to date ([#35](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/35)), inferring addresses from SystemConfig ([#71](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/71)), and checking config parameters for each chain ([#294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/294)).
- Issues concerning the structure and content of chain configurations were addressed, such as prefixing addresses with L1 or L2 ([#3](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/3)), adding chain names to `addresses.json` ([#999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/999)), and adding `L2ProxyAdminOwner` to TOML files ([#470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/470)).

### CI/CD and Testing Improvements
- Flaky CI issues were resolved, specifically concerning the `add-chain` help flag redefinition ([#477](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/477)) and nil pointer dereference during `add-chain` tests ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/635)).
- The `op-acceptance-tests` workflow was made blocking to prevent merges with failing tests ([#16270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16270)).

### Feature and Support Enhancements
- Support for Holesky testnets was implemented ([#518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/518)).
- The `add-chain` script was updated to handle input variations in `genesis.json` and `rollup.json` ([#220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/220)).
- Contract implementation addresses were added to the superchain config ([#520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/520)).
- The storage and discovery of fault proofs contract addresses in chain configs were overhauled ([#604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/604)).
- The L1 RPC URL was moved from superchain initialization to validation ([#609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/609)).
- An issue regarding `op-deployer` verification guides was closed as no longer a priority ([#17145](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17145)).
- An issue to tune the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy-upstream-messages-low` alert on Sepolia was completed, with `op-conductor` still not in the flashblocks propagation flow ([#17716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17716)).
- An issue to improve `op-deployer` logs and Etherscan verification on Sepolia was closed in favor of another issue ([#18089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18089)).

## NEW ISSUES
- No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Acceptance Testing and CI/CD
- **[op-acceptance-tests] Report unused tests ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16273))**: Discussion continues on whether to implement reporting for unused acceptance tests and if a "staging" gate for non-blocking tests is desired. The latest comment from janjakubnanista questions if this is still a desired feature.
- **[op-acceptance-tests] Parallelise "memory-all" job ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17525))**: The issue aims to parallelize the "memory-all" job to prevent increased CI duration, especially since the workflow is becoming blocking. janjakubnanista noted that the PR fixing this was autoclosed and asked if the task is still relevant.
- **ci: update `golang-validate-all` job to give summary of passes/failures ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/644))**: This issue seeks to improve the `golang-validate-all` CI job by providing a summary of passes/failures for easier debugging. janjakubnanista asked if this has been addressed by SCR 2.0.

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **alert when non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16867))**: The goal is to create an alert for when a non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer becomes active or flashblocks are disabled. zhwrd inquired if the ticket is still relevant or if detection methods already exist.

### Registry and Validation Refactoring
- **SuperchainRegistry: improve the diff tools ([#284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/284))**: This issue focuses on enhancing diff tools to include `op-geth` and other components. janjakubnanista asked if these tools have been revamped with the recent refactor.
- **investigate L2 key handover test ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/643))**: The issue involves investigating a specific L2 key handover test. janjakubnanista questioned if this is still relevant after the refactor.
- **encode ProxyAdminOwner exceptions for Base and Unichain ([#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/675))**: This issue aims to encode specific `ProxyAdminOwner` exceptions for Base and Unichain as per the Standard Rollup Charter. janjakubnanista believes this has been addressed by SCR 2.0 and sought confirmation.

### Proxyd Behavior
- **proxyd: backwards time travel is possible when backends are not in sync ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/501))**: This issue describes a scenario where Proxyd can return older blocks if its backends are out of sync. alfonso-op linked a related issue for more details.
