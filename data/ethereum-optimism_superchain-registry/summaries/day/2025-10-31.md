# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Oct 31, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining CI/CD processes, specifically adjusting CircleCI notifications for daily codegen. A significant number of older issues were closed, indicating a cleanup of the issue backlog, particularly those related to validation, configuration, and testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD Enhancements
- Adjusted CircleCI configuration to ping the secondary on-call engineer for daily codegen tasks, improving notification routing. ([#1136](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1136))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#1135](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1135), was opened for an automated codegen update.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Validation and Configuration Improvements
- Closed issues related to ensuring contract and role lists are up-to-date as the protocol changes ([#35](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/35)), inferring addresses from SystemConfig post-MCP L1 launch ([#71](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/71)), and checking config parameters for each chain ([#294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/294)).
- Addressed the need to add L2ProxyAdminOwner to TOML files ([#470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/470)) and support Holesky testnets ([#518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/518)).

### Registry Data and Structure Refinements
- Resolved issues concerning the prefixing of addresses with L1 or L2 depending on the chain ([#3](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/3)) and adding chain names to `addresses.json` when TOML files are removed ([#999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/999)).
- Closed issues related to adding contract implementation addresses to superchain config ([#520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/520)) and overhauling how fault proof contract addresses are stored and discovered ([#604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/604)).

### CI/CD and Tooling Stability
- Closed issues addressing CI flakes related to `add-chain` help flag redefinition ([#477](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/477)) and nil pointer dereference during `add-chain` tests ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/issues/635)).
- Resolved the issue of moving the L1 RPC URL from superchain init to validation ([#609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/609)).

### Documentation and Verification
- Closed an issue regarding adding verification guides to OP docs for `op-deployer` ([#17145](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17145)).

## NEW ISSUES
- No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Acceptance Testing and CI/CD Reliability
- **[op-acceptance-tests] Make acceptance-test workflow blocking** ([#16270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16270)): The tests are now blocking. Previously, there was a discussion about improving test runtime and flakiness before making them blocking to avoid impacting developer velocity.
- **[op-acceptance-tests] Report unused tests** ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16273)): A recent comment from janjakubnanista asks if this is still a desired feature. Earlier discussions included the idea of a "staging" gate for tests that run but don't block merges.
- **[op-acceptance-tests] Parallelise "memory-all" job** ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17525)): janjakubnanista noted that the PR fixing this was auto-closed and questioned if this is still a priority. The goal is to parallelize the job to prevent increased CI duration when the workflow becomes blocking.
- **ci: update `golang-validate-all` job to give summary of passes/failures** ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/644)): janjakubnanista asked if this has been addressed by SCR 2.0. Previously, jmcoplabs moved this to backlog, awaiting a refactor to decouple the golang test framework from the validation core logic to enable summary generation.

### Flashblocks and Sequencer Monitoring
- **alert when non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off** ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16867)): zhwrd inquired if this ticket is still relevant or if flashblocks disablement can already be detected. The alert is intended for scenarios where a backup sequencer without flashblocks components becomes active.
- **tune flashblocks-websocket-proxy-upstream-messages-low alert sepolia** ([#17716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17716)): yashvardhan-kukreja confirmed this is completed, with `op-conductor` still removed from the flashblocks propagation flow. zhwrd had asked for an update on its in-progress status.

### `op-deployer` and `proxyd` Issues
- **op-deployer: logs + etherscan verification on sepolia** ([#18089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18089)): Ethnical closed this issue in favor of a related issue, [#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17213). The original issue aimed to improve log clarity for already deployed contracts and Etherscan verification.
- **proxyd: backwards time travel is possible when backends are not in sync** ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/501)): alfonso-op linked this to a related issue, [#17688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17688), for more details. The problem describes `proxyd` returning older blocks as `unsafe` if its backends are out of sync.

### Registry Tooling and Validation
- **SuperchainRegistry: improve the diff tools** ([#284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/284)): janjakubnanista asked if these diff tools have been revamped with the refactor. The issue aimed to extend diff capabilities to `op-geth`.
- **investigate L2 key handover test** ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/643)): janjakubnanista questioned if this is still relevant after the refactor. The issue was about investigating a bug in the L2 key handover test.
- **encode ProxyAdminOwner exceptions for Base and Unichain** ([#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/675)): janjakubnanista believes this has been addressed by SCR 2.0 and asked for confirmation from bitwiseguy. The issue aimed to encode specific exceptions for Base and Unichain's ProxyAdminOwner as per the Standard Rollup Charter.
