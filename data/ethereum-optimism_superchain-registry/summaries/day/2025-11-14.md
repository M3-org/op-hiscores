# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating the `print-staging-report` command for dispute game parameter extraction and adding new standard prestates. Several issues related to dispute game compatibility and Kona client support were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dispute Game Parameter Extraction
The `print-staging-report` command was updated to correctly fetch permissioned dispute game parameters, now supporting extraction from game arguments rather than solely from immutable implementation contract values. This change improves compatibility with newer dispute game configurations. ([#1150](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1150))

### Standard Prestate Updates
New standard prestates were added, specifically `kona-client/v1.2.4`, enhancing the validation process. ([#1154](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1154))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#1155](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1155) chore: removing snax chain
*   [#1153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1153) Update broken links inside the documentation
*   [#1152](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1152) Update changed links

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dispute Game Report Compatibility
The issue regarding the `print_staging_report` script's compatibility with dispute-game v2 was closed. The script now correctly handles dispute game parameters from game arguments, addressing previous limitations where it only read from the implementation contract. ([#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1148))

### Kona Client Compatibility
An issue related to Kona's compatibility with websocket URLs in acceptance tests was resolved. Kona has been updated to support these connections, ensuring proper functionality. ([#18203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18203))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-program: Add hint for fast block header oracle lookup ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17416))
This issue was closed today. The discussion centered on adding a hint to `op-program` for faster block header oracle lookups. While a hint was added to `op-program`, it is not currently utilized as the system still relies on `op-geth` for data lookup via `debug_dbGet`. Kona client, however, uses a different lookup logic that directly reads the storage slot and outputs a hint. The issue was closed as the hint functionality has been implemented.
