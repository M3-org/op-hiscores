# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating the `print-staging-report` command for dispute game parameter extraction and adding new standard prestates. Several issues related to dispute game compatibility and Kona client support were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dispute Game Report Tooling Enhancements
The `print-staging-report` command was updated to correctly fetch permissioned dispute game parameters from game arguments, improving its compatibility with newer dispute game configurations. This change involved modifications to internal game argument handling and reporting bindings. ([#1150](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1150))

### Standard Prestate Updates
A new version of the Kona client (`kona-client/v1.2.4`) was added to the standard prestates, ensuring up-to-date configurations for validation. ([#1154](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1154))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#1155](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1155) chore: removing snax chain
- [#1153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1153) Update broken links inside the documentation
- [#1152](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1152) Update changed links

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Reports
The `print_staging_report` script was updated to be compatible with dispute-game v2, specifically addressing how game arguments are read from the Dispute Game Factory (DGF) rather than directly from the implementation contract. ([#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1148))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-program: Add hint for fast block header oracle lookup
This issue, concerning the addition of a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program`, was closed today. The discussion highlighted that a hint was added to `op-program`, and while it's not currently used due to reliance on `op-geth`, `kona-client` has been updated to read storage slots directly and output a hint. ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17416))

### Fix kona compatibility with websockets URL in acceptance tests
This issue, addressing Kona's compatibility with websocket URLs in acceptance tests, was closed today. The resolution states that Kona has been updated to resolve the incompatibility. ([#18203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18203))
