# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Aug 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in closing out long-standing issues related to proofs system acceptance testing and event system cleanup. A new pull request was opened for Celo-sepolia integration.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#1099](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1099), was opened to integrate Celo-sepolia.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Proofs System Acceptance Testing
The issue related to providing acceptance tests for the proofs system for pre-interop and post-interop chains, [#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15946), was closed as all sub-issues were completed. Similarly, the issue for adding `op-challenger` acceptance tests on interop chains, [#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15948), was closed after the last remaining TODO was addressed.

### Event System Cleanup
The issue to remove two events from the event system, [#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17001), was closed, with associated pull requests linked in the comments.

### Test Target Setup/Teardown
The issue concerning the incorporation of test target setup/teardown as an `op-acceptor` concern, [#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/375), was closed as the importance of Kurtosis for network testing versus Sysgo was re-evaluated.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Contract Verification Improvements
Issue [#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/14813) discusses improvements for contract verification. The latest comment suggests revisiting `op-deployer` contract verification once forge binary support is implemented, aiming to leverage `forge verify-contract` to reduce custom verification code. The discussion also previously considered using Sourcify for verification.
