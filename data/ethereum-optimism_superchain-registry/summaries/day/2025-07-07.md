## ACTIVE ISSUES
**`op-node` Interop Logic Discussion**
Discussion continued on an issue concerning adding a mode to `op-node` to use pre-Interop logic in trivial-Interop cases ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16520)). A comment from tynes on July 7th suggested considering an approach similar to `op-e2e` or `sysgo`, where services run in the same process, and questioned if this would be a viable solution. The issue was later closed on July 9th, with tynes stating it would no longer be prioritized.
