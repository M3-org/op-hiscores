## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node EL Sync Mode Stuck
Discussion continued on the issue where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart when Reth has already synced data ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18468)). A temporary workaround was suggested: changing the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restarting the `op-node`. This issue is impacting a Base Mainnet node configured for execution layer syncing.
