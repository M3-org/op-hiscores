## NEW ISSUES
- A new issue, [#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18407), was opened regarding an "op deployer with custom intent (faultGameClockExtension, faultGameMaxClockDuration) reverts". The issue describes a problem where the `op deployer` fails when using custom values for `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration`, but works with standard values.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Dispute Game Creator Pattern Refactor Audit**
  Issue [#17069](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17069), concerning the audit for the Dispute Game Creator Pattern refactor, is currently in progress as part of a general U18 audit. The latest comment from pauldowman on November 27, 2025, confirms this status. Previously, on September 11, 2025, pauldowman requested @stevennevins to add an overview and specific points for auditors in the security readiness document.

- **Op Deployer with Custom Intent Reverts**
  Issue [#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18407) discusses a problem where the `op deployer` reverts when using custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values. The latest comment from ajsutton on November 27, 2025, suggests that the issue might be related to a validation check in `FaultDisputeGame.sol` that requires `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` to be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration`. It also advises caution against reducing the preimage oracle challenge period and using a very short dispute game clock in production.
