## ACTIVE ISSUES
*   **Dispute Game Creator Pattern Refactor Audit**
    The audit for the Dispute Game Creator Pattern refactor ([#17069](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17069)) is in progress as part of a general U18 audit. Previously, a request was made to add an overview and specific points for auditors in the security readiness document.

*   **`op deployer` with Custom Fault Game Parameters**
    A new issue ([#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18407)) was opened regarding `op deployer` reverting when using custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values. It was suggested that this is likely due to a validation requiring `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` to be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration`. It was also noted that reducing the `preimageOracleChallengePeriod` significantly in production is not advisable due to data retrieval time, and a 4-hour dispute game clock is very short given the need to execute cannon and many on-chain transactions.
