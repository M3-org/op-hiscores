## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolution of Op Deployer Revert Issue
The issue concerning the op deployer reverting with custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values was closed. The problem was identified as a validation requirement where `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` must be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration`, and the user successfully resolved it by overriding `PreimageOracleChallengePeriod` for testnet deployments. ([#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18407))
