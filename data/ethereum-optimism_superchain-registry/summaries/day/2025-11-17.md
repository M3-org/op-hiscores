# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on maintenance, specifically removing the deprecated `snax` chain from the registry. Several older issues were closed due to age or irrelevance, and new documentation-related pull requests were opened.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Registry Cleanup and Deprecation**
    *   Removed the `snax` chain from the mainnet configuration and associated files, replacing a previous pull request. ([#1157](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1157))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   **Documentation Improvements**
    *   A pull request was opened to fix grammar and correct a charter name within the `glossary.md` file. ([#1160](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1160))
    *   Another pull request aims to correct a link related to `op-node` in the documentation. ([#1159](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1159))

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Outdated and Resolved Issues**
    *   Several long-standing issues were closed due to their age and presumed resolution or irrelevance, including problems with L2 network divergence ([#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15782)), `op-node` goroutine issues ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16332)), Engine API status mismatches ([#596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/596)), and `op-geth` state DB corruption ([#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/549)).
*   **Flaky Test Resolution**
    *   A flaky test related to `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` was closed as it had not been observed recently. ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17966))
*   **CI/CD Optimization**
    *   An issue to parallelize the "memory-all" job in `op-acceptance-tests` was closed as it is no longer needed. ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17525))

## NEW ISSUES

No new issues were opened on Nov 17, 2025.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **`op-devstack`: `sysext`: fix address book** ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15817))
    *   The issue, created on May 9, 2025, concerns the `sysext` address book not being updated after changes to the `kt` local devnet description.
    *   Initially closed by `mslipper` on Nov 17, 2025, due to `kt` being deprecated, it was re-opened by `ajsutton` on Nov 18, 2025, citing remaining TODOs for the issue.
*   **`min-base-fee`: conduct simulations which prove effectiveness of the feature** ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16958))
    *   This issue, opened on Aug 5, 2025, proposes using Kurtosis devnet, a transaction spamming tool, and batcher throttling to simulate priority fee auctions and test the effectiveness of different minimum base fees.
    *   `mslipper` inquired on Nov 17, 2025, if the issue is still relevant.
*   **`min-base-fee`: runbook for low batcher throughput** ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16959))
    *   Created on Aug 5, 2025, this issue focuses on ensuring alerting for high `MinBaseFee` and low batcher throughput, and creating a runbook for response.
    *   `mslipper` questioned on Nov 17, 2025, if this issue remains relevant.
*   **`op-acceptance-test`: add back `op-reth` to jovian `kt-devnet`** ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17475))
    *   Opened on Sep 16, 2025, this issue tracks the re-integration of `op-reth` into the `kt-devnet` once it supports the minimum base fee.
    *   `geoknee` commented on Oct 2, 2025, that since Kurtosis devnet is deprecated, `op-reth` should instead be integrated into the `devstack` / `sysgo` system.
    *   `mslipper` followed up on Nov 17, 2025, asking if the issue is still relevant.
*   **Flaky test: `TestBreakTimestampInvariant`** ([#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18137))
    *   This issue, created on Nov 3, 2025, reports a flaky test.
    *   `mslipper` provided an example failure link on Nov 17, 2025, to aid in debugging.
