# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 17, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on maintenance, specifically the removal of the `snax` chain from the registry. Several older issues were closed due to age or deprecation, and new pull requests were opened to address documentation and operational improvements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Configuration Updates
The `snax` chain, previously part of the `mainnet` configuration, was removed from the superchain registry. This involved updates across various configuration files, including `CHAINS.md`, `chainList.json`, `chainList.toml`, and specific `snax.toml` and `snax.json.zst` files.

- Closure of `op-geth` state DB corruption issue due to age ([#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/549))

### Test Flakiness Resolution
A specific flaky test related to channel manager memory was closed as it has not been observed recently.
- Resolution of `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` flakiness ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17966))

### CI/CD Optimization
An issue concerning the parallelization of the "memory-all" job in `op-acceptance-tests` was closed as it is no longer needed.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `min-base-fee` Feature Relevance
Discussions on issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature are ongoing, with a focus on their current relevance.
- **Simulations for `min-base-fee` effectiveness ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16958))**: mslipper questioned the current relevance of conducting simulations to prove the effectiveness of the `min-base-fee` feature.
- **Runbook for low batcher throughput with `min-base-fee` ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16959))**: mslipper also inquired about the continued relevance of creating a runbook for responding to low batcher throughput when `MinBaseFee` is set too high.

### `op-reth` Integration with Devnet
The integration of `op-reth` into the devnet environment is being re-evaluated due to changes in the devnet infrastructure.
- **Adding `op-reth` back to Jovian KT-devnet ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17475))**: mslipper asked about the relevance of this issue. geoknee previously commented that since Kurtosis devnet is deprecated, `op-reth` should instead be integrated into the devstack/sysgo system.

### Flaky Test Analysis
A specific flaky test is under review, with an example failure provided for investigation.
- **Flaky test: `TestBreakTimestampInvariant` ([#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18137))**: mslipper provided an example failure link for this flaky test, indicating ongoing investigation into its cause.
