# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 7, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating Kona prestates due to a deleted release tag, ensuring the registry reflects accurate historical data. An issue regarding `superchain_time` documentation was closed, and discussions continued on a flaky test and an `op-batcher` bug.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Kona Prestate Updates
*   Updated Kona prestates to reflect the replacement of a deleted `kona-client/v1.2.0` release tag with `kona-client/v1.2.2` due to an incorrect timestamp ([#1145](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1145)).
*   Removed references to the deleted `kona-client/v1.2.1` prestate release tag ([#1146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1146)).
*   Further updates to Kona prestates were made ([#1147](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1147)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flaky Test Investigation
*   The issue concerning the flaky `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` test ([#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17548)) was closed today. The latest comment indicates that the test is no longer appearing in the top 100 flaky tests, suggesting it has been fixed.

### op-batcher Max Frame Size
*   Discussion continued on the `op-batcher` issue regarding not limiting max frame size to max input size in generic mode for altDA ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17796)). The latest comment suggests that the relevant spec might need updating to reflect the current implementation, as the existing spec contains a statement that is now considered false. A previous comment confirmed that the issue was addressed in a specific pull request.
