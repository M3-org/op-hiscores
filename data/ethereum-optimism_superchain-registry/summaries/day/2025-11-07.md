## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flaky Test Investigation
*   The issue concerning the flaky `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` test ([#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17548)) was closed today. The latest comment indicates that the test is no longer appearing in the top 100 flaky tests, suggesting the issue has been resolved.

### op-batcher Max Frame Size in AltDA
*   Discussion continued on the `op-batcher` issue regarding not limiting max frame size to max input size in generic mode for altDA ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17796)). The latest comment suggests updating the spec to reflect the current implementation, as the existing spec might now be inaccurate regarding the `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` limit for `commitment_type == 0`. Previously, it was noted that a fix for this was addressed in a pull request.
