# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Jul 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on updating standard versions for `op-contracts/v4.0.0` across mainnet and Sepolia. Additionally, two long-standing issues related to `op-supervisor` and `op-service` logging were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Standard Version Updates**: The `superchain-registry` was updated to include `op-contracts/v4.0.0` upgrade entries for both mainnet and Sepolia standard versions, ensuring compatibility and readiness for future deployments ([#1088](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1088)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Supervisor Target Improvement**: An issue concerning the improvement of `op-supervisor` and `op-node` reset unsafe targets was closed, with the rationale that recent project changes made it no longer necessary to track ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16314)).
*   **Logger Utility Refinement**: An issue seeking a more reusable logger utility in `op-service` for changing sub-logger log-levels was closed, as the functionality is now supported through existing mechanisms for adjusting log levels based on context data ([#15139](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15139)).
