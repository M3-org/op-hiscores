## ACTIVE ISSUES

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency Discussion ([#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18347))
Discussions revolved around the necessity and implications of the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency in `AnchorStateRegistry`. Inphi suggested expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface to include an `AnchorStateRegistry` method to maintain the sanity check. Ajsutton questioned the necessity of the sanity check, noting that deployment-time checks via `OPStandardValidator` already ensure the correct `ASR` is used, and that adding `wasRespectedAtGameCreation` already ties dispute game implementations to the anchor state registry.
