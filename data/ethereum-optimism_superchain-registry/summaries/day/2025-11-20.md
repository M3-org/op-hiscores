# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw an automated codegen update and the opening of a new pull request related to staging reports. A significant issue regarding `min-base-fee` runbooks was closed, while a new issue concerning `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency was opened and actively discussed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Automated Code Generation
An automated code generation update was performed, indicating routine maintenance and synchronization of the codebase. This update was triggered by a daily CircleCI job. [#1164](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1164)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#1165](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1165), was opened to include `SystemConfig.minBaseFee` in staging reports.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Min-Base-Fee Runbook Completion
The issue [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16959), which focused on creating a runbook for low batcher throughput related to `MinBaseFee`, was closed. A runbook has been created to address potential issues if `MinBaseFee` is set too high.

## NEW ISSUES

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency Review
A new issue, [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18347), was opened to discuss removing the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry`. The current setup, which casts to `IFaultDisputeGame` for a sanity check, might not be compatible with all dispute game types.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency Discussion ([#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18347))
Discussions are ongoing regarding the necessity and implementation of the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency in `AnchorStateRegistry`. Key points include:
- **Sanity Check Purpose:** The current check ensures the `anchorStateRegistry()` from the dispute game matches the `AnchorStateRegistry` itself.
- **Alternative Approaches:** Suggestions include expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface to require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method, or questioning the necessity of the sanity check given deployment-time checks via `OPStandardValidator`.
- **Impact of `wasRespectedAtGameCreation`:** It was noted that adding `wasRespectedAtGameCreation` already ties dispute game implementations to the anchor state registry, potentially making the current dependency less problematic.
