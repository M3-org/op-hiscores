# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity primarily involved an automated codegen update to `addresses.json`, `chainList.json`, and `chainList.toml`. Discussions continued on several active issues related to ZK proof generation, challenging ZK games, and the `AnchorStateRegistry` dependency.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Automated Code Generation
An automated code generation update was performed, modifying `addresses.json`, `chainList.json`, and `chainList.toml`. This update was part of a daily CircleCI job to keep the registry files current ([#1168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1168)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### ZK Proof Generation and Challenger Strategy
Discussions continued regarding the strategy for generating ZK proofs and supporting ZK games. For [#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18319), it was suggested that the succinct Rust challenger should generate ZK proofs due to the move to a Rust stack and the complexities of reimplementing SPN interactions in Go. Regarding [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18322), the simplicity of the challenger logic suggests it could be reimplemented in `op-challenger`, though a long-term shift to a Rust challenger is anticipated. Additionally, [#18325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18325) highlighted the need for `vm-runner` to support ZK execution, with the actual ZK execution likely requiring Rust due to its dependency on `sp1`.

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency Refinement
The discussion on [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18347) focused on removing the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry`. It was noted that the sanity check for the `AnchorStateRegistry` is valuable as an extra layer of defense against using the wrong ASR. A suggestion was made to expand the `IDisputeGame` interface to include an `AnchorStateRegistry` method to maintain this check.

### Proofs System Runbook Documentation
A runbook for routing and understanding the Proofs system was produced and shared in the comments for [#18372](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18372). This runbook aims to clarify which runbook to use for any given proofs deployment based on on-chain information.
