# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's activity focused on an automated codegen update and significant discussions around ZK proof generation, challenging mechanisms, and dispute game dependencies within the Superchain ecosystem.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Automated Code Generation
An automated code generation update was performed, modifying `chainList.json`, `chainList.toml`, and `superchain/extra/addresses/addresses.json`. This update was part of a daily CircleCI job to keep the registry synchronized. ([#1168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1168))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### ZK Proof Generation and Execution
Discussions continued on supporting ZK execution within the `vm-runner` and determining the optimal service for ZK proof generation. It was suggested that the actual ZK execution would need to be in Rust due to its dependency on `sp1`, with an option to integrate a Rust executor into `vm-runner` or its Docker image ([#18325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18325)). For ZK proof generation, the consensus leaned towards the `succinct rust challenger` due to the ongoing transition to a Rust stack and the complexities of reimplementing SPN interactions in Go ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18319)).

### ZK Game Challenging Mechanisms
The approach to challenging ZK games was debated, with consideration given to supporting them in `op-challenger` or using a dedicated `succinct challenger`. The current `op-challenger` was deemed capable of reimplementing the straightforward challenger logic, though a long-term shift to a Rust-based challenger is anticipated as the Rust stack evolves ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18322)).

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency Refinement
Discussions revolved around removing the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry`. The current sanity check, which verifies the `anchorStateRegistry()` from the dispute game matches the `AnchorStateRegistry` itself, was acknowledged as an important layer of defense against accidental misconfigurations. A suggestion was made to expand the `IDisputeGame` interface to explicitly require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method, maintaining the sanity check while allowing for more flexible game types ([#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18347)).

### Proofs System Runbook Routing
A runbook for the Proofs system was produced and shared, aiming to clarify which runbook to use for any given proofs deployment based on on-chain information ([#18372](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18372)).
