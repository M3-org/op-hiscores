## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Standard Version Updates
*   Added `op-contracts/v4.1.0` entries for Sepolia and Mainnet, mirroring the `v4.1.0-rc.3` configurations ([#1109](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1109)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Validation Testing Refinement

### Fusaka Activation Test Completion
*   The Fusaka activation test for L1 was closed, indicating its successful implementation or resolution ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17500)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go1.25 Compatibility
Discussion on [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17060) confirms that the Go 1.25 compatibility issue significantly affects Cannon, specifically causing incorrect Keccak hashes and potentially other crypto functions. A Notion document provides a detailed diagnosis, linking the problem to a known Go issue. While Go 1.25.1 has been released, it does not appear to include the necessary MIPS fix.
