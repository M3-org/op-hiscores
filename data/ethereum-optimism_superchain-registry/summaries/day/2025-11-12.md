# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Nov 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating the Superchain registry with the Isthmus activation timestamp for World Chain Mainnet. A new issue was opened to update the `print_staging_report` script for dispute-game v2 compatibility.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Configuration Updates
- Added the Isthmus activation timestamp for World Chain Mainnet in its configuration file, ensuring accurate Superchain registry data ([#1149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1149)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Kona Action Test Resolution
- The issue regarding ensuring Kona has passing action tests for Jovian was closed, with the resolution that Jovian action tests were added in `op-e2e/actions/proofs` and are run by Kona's CI ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17303)).

## NEW ISSUES
### Dispute Game Script Compatibility
- A new issue was opened to update the `print_staging_report` script to be compatible with dispute-game v2, specifically to adapt it to read `gameArgs` from the DGF if available ([#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1148)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-node: single aggregate safe-head advancement FCU message per channel ([#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15393))
The discussion on this issue revolves around optimizing the frequency of `FCU` (Fork Choice Update) messages sent by the `op-node` to the execution layer (EL). The problem identified is that when the `batcher` runs with a considerable `--max-channel-duration`, it can lead to a high volume of `FCU` messages, potentially causing performance issues, especially when the EL is not local. Recent comments indicate that a merge has occurred that may help address this. There's also a suggestion to add a debounce to the engine-controller FCU code to handle expensive/inefficient API calls.

### Document cannonKonaPrestate requirement for upgrades ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18095))
This issue focuses on documenting the requirement for standard chains to always set the `cannon-kona` prestate, even though `opcm.upgrade` does not strictly enforce it. The latest comment indicates that there's an agreement with devrel to highlight this requirement in the Optimism documentation, especially as it's a concern for the U18 upgrade.

### Improve safe guards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig ([#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18246))
This issue is about enhancing safeguards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig. A comment notes a related or similar issue ([#17490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17490)), suggesting a broader interest in improving the robustness of SystemConfig updates.
