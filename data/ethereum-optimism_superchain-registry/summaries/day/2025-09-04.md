# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Sep 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a critical fix implemented to ensure CI job failures are correctly reported when `check_chainlist` fails. Discussions continued on several Flashblocks-related issues, with updates on deployment progress and remaining tasks. An important discussion also took place regarding P2P configuration defaults.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD Reliability Improvements
A fix was implemented to ensure that the `check_chainlist` command correctly exits with an error code when it fails, preventing CI jobs from passing incorrectly. This enhances the reliability of automated checks within the repository. ([#1102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1102))

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Sync Tester Network Exposure
A new issue was opened to expose more networks within the CI box for the `op-sync-tester`. This aims to facilitate testing of L2CL syncing with real chain data without writing to the L2 EL. ([#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/454))

### Flashblocks Deployment on Mainnet
A new issue was created to track the enablement of Flashblocks on the `op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-1` mainnet sequencer. This is part of the progressive deployment strategy for Flashblocks on mainnet. ([#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17317))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment Progress
Discussions on several Flashblocks deployment issues continued. For [#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16759) (enable flashblocks on prod-mainnet-op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-0), yashvardhan-kukreja provided an update on associated PRs and outlined remaining tasks, including deploying `rollup-boost` in disabled mode and then enabling its execution mode. Similarly, for [#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16761) (enable flashblocks on sunnyside sequencers), yashvardhan-kukreja confirmed that both sunnyside sequencers have `op-rbuilder` deployed and synced, detailing the next steps for `rollup-boost` deployment and execution mode enablement. For [#16763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16763) (deploy flashblocks-websocket-proxy), yashvardhan-kukreja noted that the issue is blocked on the availability of websocket connection of conductors but provided a PR that will close the issue. For [#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16764) (deploy flashblocks-rpc node), yashvardhan-kukreja indicated a need to confirm its necessity. Lastly, for [#17162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17162) ([FMA Action] Close out Flashblocks spec), yashvardhan-kukreja listed associated PRs related to the Flashblocks specification.

### P2P Gossip Configuration Defaults
Discussion continued on [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17308) (op-node/p2p/gossip - ConfigureGossip overwrites sane defaults with zero values). wood-jp clarified that a configuration with zero values for certain parameters is invalid and explained how this led to panics in tests after a dependency update. ajsutton suggested adding a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to provide fully filled, valid configurations with sensible defaults, which would prevent issues when new options are added. wood-jp acknowledged this as a potential solution but noted their current PR addresses the immediate problem.

### `op-geth` Initialization Error
Comments were added to [#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/420) (op-geth init gives "head block is not reachable" error). cliff0412 reported experiencing the same error. This issue, originally from October 2024, continues to see user reports.

### Sync Tester Network Exposure
On [#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/454) ([sync-tester] Expose More Networks inside CI Box), jelias2 provided an update on exposing L2 ELs in CI for mainnet and sepolia across various networks (unichain, ink, base). They also mentioned that exposing an L1 beacon API in CI is the remaining task and will be addressed soon. jelias2 also shared a draft PR to make the synctest more dynamic using environment variables. pcw109550 noted that the L1 Beacon API can be shared for all L2s using ETH Mainnet L1s. nonsense thanked for the updates and confirmed that the L1 ETH Mainnet beacon API in CI is the only missing piece, with tests already running daily.
