### Developer Workflow and User Experience
An issue was opened to report snags and areas for improvement in the `superchain-ops` signing flow, highlighting challenges encountered during task simulation and signing processes ([#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1224)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Snags in Superchain-Ops Flow ([#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1224))
Discussion revolves around improving the `superchain-ops` signing flow. @geoknee reported several snags, including confusing output during simulation, unclear requirements for audit reports, and the need for better explanations of concepts like "normalized state diff hash." @blmalone provided a PR addressing some of these points, clarifying that "TODOs" are for task developers during simulation, and acknowledging that the audit report workflow was experimental. There's an ongoing discussion about whether signers are expected to run task simulations and the implications for their user experience.

### Create Skeleton Upgrade Test Task ([#698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/698))
@blmalone requested @alcueca to add more detail to this ticket, indicating that the scope or requirements for creating a skeleton upgrade test task need further clarification.
