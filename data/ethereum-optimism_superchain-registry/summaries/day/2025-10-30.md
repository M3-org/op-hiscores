## ACTIVE ISSUES
Discussions on active issues focused on several key areas:

*   **Transaction Gas Limit Issues**
    A comment on [#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17912) clarified that the "transaction gas limit too high" error is due to the Fusaka hardfork (EIP-7825) enforcing a cap of 16,777,216. The suggested solution is to break down large transactions or optimize them to stay within this limit. It was also noted that an older version of `op-deployer` was being used, and a newer version (v0.5.0\*) is available, though its post-Fusaka behavior is yet to be tested.

*   **L1 Chain Configuration for L3s**
    Regarding [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18070), there was a consensus that the system should automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID and apply L3 behavior, similar to how L1 mainnet and Sepolia are recognized. This would simplify the process for most L3s.

*   **Improving Acceptance Test Execution**
    A new comment on [#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/469) highlighted that modifying devnets with options often doesn't work because orchestrator fields are private, adding to the challenges of running acceptance tests outside the monorepo.
