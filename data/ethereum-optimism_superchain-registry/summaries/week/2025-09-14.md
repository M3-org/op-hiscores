# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the stability and maintainability of the Superchain. A significant refactoring streamlined chain configurations by reducing redundant address data, making the system less prone to errors from frequent changes. Key operational milestones were achieved with the closure of issues related to load testing, partner support criteria, and preparation for the Fusaka network activation. Additionally, a critical Geth receipt decoding bug was resolved through collaborative effort, and progress was made in expanding the registry with new chain addresses and proposals.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on refining the registry's data structure and adding new configurations.

- **Configuration File Optimization:** A major refactoring was completed to reduce the number of hardcoded contract and role addresses in `.toml` files. By centralizing these values in the `addresses.json` codegen file, the configurations are now more maintainable and less likely to become stale ([#1103](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1103)). This directly addressed a long-standing issue to improve configuration accuracy ([#978](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/978)).

- **Registry Content Updates:** New addresses for `u16a` were added to the mainnet and sepolia standard versions ([#1106](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1106)). A proposal to add the Sova testnet to the registry was also opened, signaling continued ecosystem growth ([#1105](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1105)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw significant progress in resolving existing issues, with no new issues being opened.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Operational Readiness:** Several critical validation tasks were completed, including load testing for flashblocks on devnets ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16756)), evaluation of partner support criteria ([#16765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16765)), and a threat modeling analysis for the DA Footprint Limit ([#336](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/336)).
    - **Bug Fix & Infrastructure:** A critical issue causing Geth to crash from a failure to decode RLP receipts during sync was resolved and closed after a community member confirmed the fix ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/679)). Infrastructure work to prepare `proxyd` for the Fusaka activation was also completed ([#467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/467)).
    - **Tooling & Housekeeping:** An issue to create a CLI wrapper for the OP Deployer was closed ([#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17214)), and an issue regarding dispute game specifications was closed as a duplicate ([#17436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17436)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened during this period.
    - Investigation continues into a flaky acceptance test, `TestPreNoInbox` ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17298)). A recent attempt to fix the flakiness was confirmed to be unsuccessful, indicating that this remains an ongoing challenge for the team.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was key to resolving a critical bug this week. In issue [#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/679), team member @sebastianst engaged with community member @cpuchainorg, who reported a Geth crash. After a potential fix was provided, @cpuchainorg confirmed its success, demonstrating a healthy feedback loop between the core team and ecosystem users. Internal coordination was also evident in the discussion between @stevennevins and @pauldowman, which led to the efficient closure of a duplicate issue ([#17436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17436)).
