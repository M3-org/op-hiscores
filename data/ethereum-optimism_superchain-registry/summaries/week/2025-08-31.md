# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on infrastructure maintenance and planning for future protocol upgrades. A key improvement was made to the CI pipeline to enhance build reliability by removing a problematic integration. Meanwhile, significant discussions continued around the necessary changes to support Kona + Cannon, specifically defining the scope of work required in OPCM and `op-dispute-mon`. A new pull request was also opened to update contract addresses, signaling ongoing registry updates.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving the stability of the development process.

- **CI Pipeline Reliability:** The Codecov integration was removed from the CI pipeline to resolve persistent build failures. This change, implemented in [#1101](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1101), aims to create a more stable and reliable continuous integration environment for contributors.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed or newly created this week. The focus remained on clarifying the implementation details for active issues and progressing new pull requests.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Kona + Cannon Support:** Discussions progressed on the requirements for supporting the upcoming Kona + Cannon upgrade.
        - In [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17285), the conversation clarified that OPCM will require updates to `OPContractsManager.sol` to handle the deployment of the new game type.
        - Similarly, for `op-dispute-mon` ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17286)), the consensus is that the service must be explicitly updated to support cannon-kona games and return an error for any unsupported game types.
    - **Work in Progress:** A new pull request ([#1100](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1100)) was opened to update contract addresses for u16 and is currently awaiting review.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active technical discussions surrounding future protocol support. Contributors `ajsutton` and `pauldowman` worked together on issues [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17285) and [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17286) to refine the requirements for integrating Kona + Cannon support, demonstrating a proactive approach to planning for significant upcoming changes.
