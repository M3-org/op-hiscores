# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on enhancing the stability and observability of the Superchain infrastructure. A major focus was the successful rollout and stabilization of flashblocks across mainnet sequencers, a significant step in maturing the production environment. This effort was complemented by the deployment of improved monitoring and health check alerts for sequencers. While new feature development was quiet, active discussions progressed on future performance optimizations and testing enhancements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work merged during this period focused on refining existing configurations.

- **Testnet Configuration Fix:** A bug fix was merged to correct the Isthmus time for the `arena-z-testnet` configuration, ensuring accurate time synchronization for the test network ([#1104](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1104)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was characterized by the closure of several infrastructure-related tasks and active discussion on future work. No new issues were opened.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Rollout:** A significant set of issues related to enabling flashblocks on mainnet sequencers was closed, confirming the stability of the deployment ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16759), [#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16760), [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17317)).
    - **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Several issues were resolved to improve infrastructure resilience, including adding health alerts for sequencer peer counts ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16868), [#17143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17143)) and completing the deployment of `op-conductor` with EL p2p healthchecks ([#17153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17153)).
    - **Documentation & Cleanup:** A documentation tutorial for bridging ETH was updated ([#1473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1473)), and several obsolete smoke test issues were closed ([#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/141), [#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/142), [#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/143)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - A notable decision was made in [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17194) to **not** implement Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy, with the issue pending minor code cleanup before closure.
    - Progress continues on adding Soneium to contract upgrade tests, with a pull request now open to address the task ([#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17332)).
    - Early-stage discussion is underway for a performance optimization in `op-program` to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookups, with a draft PR available for validation ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17416)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active issue discussions. The decision regarding Websockets support in [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17194) involved coordination between contributors @alfonso-op and @ajsutton. Similarly, discussion around the `op-program` optimization in [#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17416) showed active communication between @emhane, @meyer9, and @ajsutton to ensure visibility and provide a starting point for the work. Contributor @MozirDmitriy provided a clear status update on [#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17332), demonstrating healthy project communication.
