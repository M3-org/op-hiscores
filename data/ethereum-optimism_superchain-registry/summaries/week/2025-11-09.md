# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity focused on maintaining the integrity of the Superchain registry while preparing for future protocol enhancements. A key update involved adding the Isthmus activation timestamp for World Chain Mainnet, ensuring its configuration is up-to-date. Concurrently, preparatory work began for `dispute-game v2` with a new issue opened to update a critical validation script. Ongoing discussions centered on optimizing `op-node` performance, improving upgrade documentation, and enhancing safeguards around SystemConfig updates.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The primary development this week was a direct update to the Superchain's configuration data.

- **Superchain Configuration Updates:** The Isthmus activation timestamp for World Chain Mainnet was officially added to its configuration file. This change ensures the Superchain registry contains accurate data for the chain's upgrade schedule ([#1149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1149)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving a CI/testing gap and opening new issues for future compatibility, alongside active discussions on performance and safety.

- **Closed Issues:** A key testing issue was resolved by integrating Jovian action tests into the `op-e2e/actions/proofs` suite. This ensures that Kona's CI now properly runs these tests, closing a gap in test coverage ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17303)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`dispute-game v2` Compatibility:** A new issue was opened to update the `print_staging_report` script for compatibility with `dispute-game v2`. This is a crucial step for validating new chains that will be added to the Superchain registry in the future ([#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1148)).
    - **`op-node` Performance:** Active discussion continues on issue [#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15393) regarding the reduction of excessive FCU (Fork-Choice Updated) messages, or "FCU spam," in `op-node`.
    - **Upgrade Documentation:** A conversation around documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades is moving forward, with confirmation that this will be highlighted in the official documentation, particularly for the U18 upgrade ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18095)).
    - **System Safeguards:** The need to improve safeguards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig is under review, with connections being made to broader safety improvement efforts ([#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18246)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Discussions on active issues highlighted ongoing collaboration between team members to address complex technical challenges. For instance, the discussion on documenting upgrade requirements ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18095)) showed coordination with the devrel team to ensure clarity for developers. Similarly, active participation from multiple contributors in the `op-node` performance discussion ([#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15393)) demonstrates a collective effort to optimize core components of the stack.
