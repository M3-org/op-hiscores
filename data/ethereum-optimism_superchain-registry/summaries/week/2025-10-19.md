# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing development infrastructure and resolving outstanding tasks. A significant push was made to automate code generation through new CircleCI jobs, aiming to streamline maintenance and ensure repository consistency. Alongside this automation work, the team conducted substantial housekeeping by closing numerous issues related to past upgrades and refining validation processes. Meanwhile, preparations for the upcoming Fusaka upgrade continue, with key tasks completed for the Sepolia testnet.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Development work focused primarily on improving the CI/CD pipeline and maintaining chain configurations.

- **CI/CD Automation for Code Generation:** A new daily job was added to CircleCI to automatically run code generation and create pull requests when changes are detected ([#1120](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1120)). A subsequent fix was required to ensure the job triggers correctly ([#1123](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1123)). This new automation produced several automated codegen update PRs throughout the week ([#1121](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1121), [#1122](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1122), [#1124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1124)).

- **Superchain Configuration Updates:** The `worldchain-sepolia` configuration was updated to include its Isthmus activation timestamp ([#1119](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1119)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened this week, but significant progress was made on closing old issues and advancing active investigations.

- **Closed Issues:** A large number of issues were closed, reflecting a period of cleanup and finalization:
    - **Process Refinement:** The chain validation process was shifted from a blocking check on pull requests to a more flexible report-based approach, leading to the closure of issues [#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/689) and [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/696).
    - **Jovian Upgrade Finalization:** Tasks related to the previous Jovian upgrade, such as updating transaction bytecodes and default values, were completed and closed ([#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/772), [#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/773)).
    - **Tooling & CI:** The issue to create a daily codegen job ([#979](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/979)) was closed following its implementation.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Fusaka Upgrade Preparations:** Discussions continue on preparing for the Fusaka upgrade. Work on `op-geth` is complete for Sepolia but pending for Mainnet ([#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/682)). Similarly, a task to update the absolute prestate has been executed on Sepolia, with discussion on whether to keep the ticket open to track the Mainnet task ([#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1206)).
    - **Active Investigations:** Progress was made on investigating a DA footprint limit issue, with the root cause identified and a fix in progress ([#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17946)). An issue regarding dispute game contract updates was reopened as tests are still being skipped, indicating further work is needed ([#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17267)).
    - **Developer Tooling:** A discussion on an `mise install` error ([#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17963)) identified a problem with the latest version of `mise` and provided a workaround for developers.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the focused effort to improve developer tooling and automation. The rapid sequence of adding a new CI job ([#1120](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1120)) and then quickly fixing it ([#1123](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1123)) highlights an iterative and responsive development process. Ongoing discussions in issues related to the Fusaka upgrade ([#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/682), [#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1206)) demonstrate cross-team coordination in tracking progress across different network environments.
