# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Jun 1 - 7, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the integrity and automation of the Superchain registry. Key developments included re-enabling EthLockboxProxy consistency validation to ensure data integrity and optimizing CI/CD workflows for more efficient webhook triggers. A new initiative to remove legacy CGT-related code was started, signaling a focus on code hygiene. Meanwhile, significant technical discussions continued around the `op-supervisor`'s role in fault proofs and reset logic, and a user-impacting nonce issue on Base nodes remains an active concern.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving registry validation, CI processes, and code maintenance.

- **Registry Integrity and Automation:**
  - Consistency validation for EthLockboxProxy was re-enabled by updating the `op-fetcher` and regenerating code, strengthening data integrity checks within the registry ([#1071](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1071)).
  - The CircleCI configuration was refined to ensure the `notify-when-chain-is-added-to-registry` workflow is triggered exclusively by webhook events, optimizing CI resource usage ([#1073](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1073)).

- **Code Cleanup and Refactoring:**
  - A pull request was opened to begin removing CGT-related code from the repository, suggesting a move to deprecate or clean up older functionalities ([#1074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1074)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed this week, but discussions on several critical active issues progressed.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **`op-supervisor` Enhancements:** Discussions continued on two key issues related to the `op-supervisor`. One conversation focuses on handling pre-interop super roots for fault proofs ([#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16166)), while another aims to improve the supervisor's reset logic to better validate L1 origins ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16315)). These discussions are critical for the security and reliability of the fault proof system.
  - **Incorrect Nonce Bug:** A user-facing issue where Base nodes return an incorrect nonce for pending transactions ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/623)) remains active. A community member requested an update, highlighting its ongoing impact on users experiencing stuck transactions.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week saw focused technical discussions among contributors on core protocol components, particularly the `op-supervisor`. The ongoing dialogue in issues #16166 and #16315 indicates deep collaboration on complex topics like fault proof construction and node reset behavior. Additionally, community feedback remains a key driver, as seen in the follow-up on the active nonce bug (#623), which keeps attention on a significant user pain point.
