# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's focus was on expanding the Superchain and preparing for future protocol upgrades. The most significant development was the re-addition of Celo mainnet to the Superchain Registry, which required special handling for its unique genesis history as a former L1 fork. Concurrently, standard versions for mainnet and Sepolia were updated to include `op-contracts/v4.0.0`, setting the stage for upcoming deployments. The team also performed maintenance by closing several older issues related to `op-supervisor`, logging, and flashblocks enablement, streamlining the project's backlog.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on registry expansion and preparation for contract upgrades.

*   **Superchain Expansion with Celo Mainnet:** Celo mainnet was re-integrated into the Superchain Registry ([#1086](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1086)). This update included specific logic to validate its genesis, accounting for its history as an L1 fork that was converted to an L2, and involved updates to chain configurations, address lists, and genesis integrity checks.

*   **Protocol Upgrade Preparation:** The registry was updated to include `op-contracts/v4.0.0` upgrade entries for both mainnet and Sepolia standard versions ([#1088](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1088)). This ensures the registry is aligned with the latest contract versions for future deployments.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on closing out stale or superseded tasks, with no new issues being opened.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Component Improvements:** An issue to improve `op-supervisor` and `op-node` reset targets ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16314)) was closed, as recent project changes rendered it obsolete. A related issue for a more reusable logger in `op-service` ([#15139](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15139)) was also closed, with the functionality now covered by existing mechanisms.
    *   **Flashblocks Enablement:** Two issues tracking flashblocks enablement ([#16544](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16544), [#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16496)) were closed in favor of more structured tracking via a new issue and a project milestone, respectively.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   No new issues were opened this week. The primary active discussion on issue [#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16314) concluded with its closure, indicating that all actionable items had been addressed by other recent work.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
