# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Nov 23 - 29, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity was dominated by strategic discussions around the integration of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof systems. While the only code change was a routine automated update to registry configurations, significant progress was made in architecting the future of ZK proof generation, execution, and challenging mechanisms. A recurring theme in these discussions is the strategic consideration of a Rust-based stack for new proof system components. Additionally, a new runbook for the proofs system was produced to improve operational clarity for developers.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The sole technical change this week involved routine maintenance to keep the registry's configurations current.

- **Automated Registry Updates:** An automated process updated `addresses.json`, `chainList.json`, and `chainList.toml`, ensuring the registry remains synchronized with the latest chain and contract information ([#1168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1168)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Discussions this week centered on architectural planning for the proofs system and smart contract interfaces, with no new or closed issues reported.

- **Closed Issues:** Based on the provided reports, no issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Architecting the ZK Proof System:** A significant portion of the week's discussion focused on designing the implementation of ZK proofs. Key topics included:
        - **Proof Generation:** The succinct Rust challenger was recommended for generating ZK proofs over extending the Go-based `op-proposer`, signaling a potential shift to a Rust stack for these critical components ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18319)).
        - **Proof Execution:** It was suggested that ZK execution logic should reside in Rust due to `sp1` dependencies, with the possibility of embedding a Rust executor within `vm-runner` ([#18325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18325)).
        - **Challenging Games:** A debate is ongoing about whether to reimplement challenger logic in `op-challenger` for the short term or wait for a more integrated long-term Rust solution ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18322)).
    - **Contract Interface Refinements:** A discussion on the `AnchorStateRegistry` proposed expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface. This would remove a direct dependency on `IFaultDisputeGame`, allowing for greater flexibility with different game types while maintaining important sanity checks ([#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18347)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was characterized by deep technical design discussions within GitHub issues rather than pull request activity. The conversations around the ZK proof system highlight a focused effort by core contributors to define the project's long-term technical direction, particularly concerning the trade-offs between extending existing Go components and migrating to a Rust-based stack. The creation and sharing of a new runbook for the proofs system ([#18372](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18372)) also demonstrates a commitment to improving internal documentation and knowledge sharing among developers.
