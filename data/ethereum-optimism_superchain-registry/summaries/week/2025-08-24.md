# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on expanding the Superchain's testing infrastructure and improving foundational developer tooling. The most significant development was the addition of the Arena Z testnet, broadening the available environments for ecosystem participants. Concurrently, important discussions took place around enhancing the CI/CD pipeline for better integration testing and overhauling documentation to simplify the rollup deployment process for external operators.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
### Superchain Registry Expansion
The Superchain was expanded with the addition of a new testnet. This effort involved adding the configuration, chain list entries, and genesis data for Arena Z, providing another valuable testing environment for developers building on the OP Stack ([#1092](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1092)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week based on the available data. The focus remained on discussing improvements to testing, CI, and documentation.

### New & Active Issues
Key discussions this week revolved around improving the project's core infrastructure and developer experience:

*   **CI/CD Enhancements:** A new issue ([#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/665)) was opened to explore running the monorepo CI suite on `op-geth` pull requests to catch integration issues earlier. An alternative proposal involves a periodic job to check for failures against the latest `op-geth` commit, aiming to provide rapid feedback.
*   **Rollup Deployment Documentation:** Discussions continued on improving the documentation for deploying an OP Stack Rollup testnet ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1530)). A significant overhaul is reportedly in progress via a "rich PR" to clarify the process for external chain operators and address confusion between old and new deployment methods.
*   **Enabling Flashblock Tests:** A smaller task to enable flashblock tests against persistent devnets is being tracked in issue [#17248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17248), with recent comments confirming the work is ready for final verification.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active issue discussions this week. Contributors like krofax, Ajsutton, and Stevmark11 were involved in driving conversations forward on key topics. The discussion on CI improvements in [#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/665) saw active problem-solving with alternative approaches being suggested. Similarly, the focus on improving documentation in [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1530) highlights the community's commitment to making the Superchain more accessible to external developers.
