# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Sep 21 - 27, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by a significant push to mature and streamline the `superchain-ops` framework, with a large number of legacy issues related to architecture, tooling, and developer experience being resolved. This effort culminated in a more refined development process, including new task management and testing methodologies. A key feature was also introduced with the addition of a new standard contract version, `op-contracts/v3.0.1`, which enables configurable gas limits on both Sepolia and Mainnet. While this cleanup represents substantial progress, newly opened issues around the developer workflow, particularly the signing process, highlight the next set of challenges in improving user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused heavily on refining the core operational tooling and updating contract standards.

- **`superchain-ops` Framework Maturation:** A major effort was completed to streamline the `superchain-ops` architecture. This involved closing numerous issues related to tooling and processes, such as deprecating `JsonTxBuilderBase.sol` and `sim-seq`, improving proposal operations, and refining simulation outputs ([#12](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/12), [#49](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/49), [#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/140), [#427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/427), [#436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/436)). This refactoring simplifies the framework and enhances its usability for developers.

- **New Standard Contract Version:** A new standard version, `op-contracts/v3.0.1`, was added for both Sepolia and Mainnet ([#1107](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1107)). This update introduces the ability to configure gas limits within the `DeployOPChain.s.sol` script, providing more flexibility for chain deployments.

- **Developer Experience & CI/CD:** Several improvements were made to the development environment. Fixes were implemented for CI rate-limiting issues, and installation instructions in the README were updated for clarity ([#569](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/569), [#617](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/617), [#628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/628)). Additionally, folder numbering is now enforced for tasks to maintain organizational consistency ([#203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/203)).

- **Governance & Security Tooling:** Progress was made on governance-related tooling. Security council rehearsals were reimplemented using the new `superchain-ops` format ([#529](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/529)), and a new template was created to facilitate swapping owners ([#1167](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1167)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The issue landscape reflects a transition from large-scale refactoring to focusing on workflow refinement and code quality.

- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were closed, primarily related to the `superchain-ops` architectural overhaul. These closures resolved problems in task management, simulation processes, CI/CD pipelines, and developer tooling, marking the completion of a major phase of work. Key examples include making task invocation easier ([#593](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/593)), fixing test failures with the latest Foundry version ([#577](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/577)), and improving simulation output ([#714](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/714), [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/781)).

- **New & Active Issues:** As the framework matures, new issues are emerging around developer experience and code quality. A key active discussion is happening in [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1224), where snags in the `superchain-ops` signing flow were reported, including confusing output and unclear requirements. This feedback is critical for the next iteration of tooling improvements. Additionally, new issues were opened to promote best practices, such as splitting test assertions ([#17598](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17598)) and adding helper functions to reduce code duplication ([#17600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17600)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The activity this week highlights a healthy feedback loop within the contributor community. The discussion in issue [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1224) between @geoknee and @blmalone is a prime example of this, where user-reported friction in the signing process was met with direct engagement and clarification from the development team. This collaborative dynamic is essential for refining the developer experience and ensuring the tools meet the needs of their users. Further collaboration is evident in issue [#698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/698), where team members are working to clarify requirements for future tasks.
