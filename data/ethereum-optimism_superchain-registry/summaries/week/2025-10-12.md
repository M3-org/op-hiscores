# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on improving system reliability and developer experience. Key progress included enhancing CI/CD error messages for faster debugging and resolving critical Flashblocks proxy issues to ensure stable block forwarding. Additionally, significant discussion continued around improving the robustness of the dispute monitor (`op-dispute-mon`) when dealing with out-of-sync nodes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on strengthening the project's continuous integration pipeline.

*   **CI/CD Enhancements:** To aid developers in debugging configuration errors, CI error messages for duplicate chain names and IDs were improved to provide more detailed and actionable information ([#1118](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1118)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving connectivity problems and advancing discussions on core monitoring components.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Flashblocks Proxy Resolution:** Two related issues concerning the Flashblocks service were closed. A problem causing lost blocks due to connectivity and timeout issues in the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` was fixed ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17856)). Coordination with RPC providers to upgrade to the new Flashblocks RPC node was also successfully completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17857)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   No new issues were opened this week.
    *   Discussion remains active on improving how `op-dispute-mon` handles out-of-sync nodes ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17814)). The conversation is exploring a more robust solution that may involve using the `syncStatus` and `CurrentL1` fields to correctly identify the expected L2 head, rather than simply trusting the node with the highest block number.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was most visible in the ongoing technical discussion for the `op-dispute-mon` sync handling issue ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17814)). The detailed exchange highlights a focused effort to find a comprehensive solution for a complex monitoring challenge.
