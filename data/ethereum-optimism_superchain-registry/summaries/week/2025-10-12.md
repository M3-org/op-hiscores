# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity focused on enhancing system reliability and developer experience. Key efforts included improving CI error messages for easier debugging and resolving connectivity issues within the Flashblocks proxy service. An important technical discussion is ongoing regarding the proper handling of out-of-sync nodes in the dispute monitor, `op-dispute-mon`, which is critical for network security and monitoring.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the development and operational pipeline.

- **CI/CD Enhancements:** To aid developers in debugging configuration errors, CI error messages for duplicate chain names and IDs were improved to provide more detailed and actionable information ([#1118](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1118)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving proxy-related bugs and advancing discussions on monitoring logic.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Proxy Resolution:** A set of issues related to the Flashblocks service was resolved. A bug causing lost flashblocks due to connectivity timeouts in the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` was fixed ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17856)). Additionally, coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers regarding a new node was successfully completed ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17857)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this week.
    - Discussion continued on a significant active issue ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17814)) concerning how `op-dispute-mon` handles out-of-sync nodes. The conversation is exploring a more robust solution that may involve using the `syncStatus` and `CurrentL1` fields to determine the correct L2 head, rather than simply trusting the highest block number, which could belong to a node on an incorrect fork.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the ongoing technical discussions and external coordination efforts. The active debate on issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17814) highlights the team's focus on finding a comprehensive solution for a complex monitoring problem. Furthermore, the resolution of issue [#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17857) demonstrates successful coordination with external RPC providers.
