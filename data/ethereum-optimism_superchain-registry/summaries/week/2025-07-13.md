# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on critical protocol updates and infrastructure modernization. A key achievement was the integration of the governance-approved prestate for Upgrade 16, ensuring the registry is aligned with the latest protocol specifications. Concurrently, a significant migration was completed, replacing all Etherscan references with Blockscout to standardize the project's block explorer tooling. The team also made substantial progress in improving operational stability by closing a backlog of issues related to sequencer behavior and acceptance testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on preparing for a major protocol upgrade and standardizing core dependencies.

- **Protocol Upgrade Preparation:** The absolute prestate for the upcoming Upgrade 16 was added to the `standard-prestates.toml` file. This crucial update ([#1084](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1084)) ensures the Superchain Registry accurately reflects the latest governance-approved configurations for the network.

- **Block Explorer Migration:** A repository-wide migration was executed to replace all Etherscan dependencies and references with Blockscout ([#1085](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1085)). This effort standardizes the project's tooling for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia, impacting numerous configuration files and documentation.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a significant cleanup of outstanding issues related to sequencer stability and testing, alongside the identification of new areas for test environment improvement.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Sequencer Stability:** Several critical issues concerning sequencer operations were resolved, including recovery from sequence window expiration ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/11228)) and halting on temporary errors ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/12240)), indicating improved operational robustness.
    - **Acceptance Testing:** Progress was made in stabilizing the test suite with the closure of issues related to porting `TestChainFork` to devstack ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/413)), failures caused by an `op-geth` version bump ([#16731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16731)), and an interop network test ([#298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/298)).
    - **Developer Tooling:** An issue regarding an outdated NPM package was closed with a note that the packages are no longer updated ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/13459)), and an `op-node` startup problem was closed as resolved ([#15411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15411)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Test Environment Alignment:** A new issue ([#16746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16746)) was opened to address a discrepancy between the local acceptance test topology and the production environment, highlighting an area for future improvement in test accuracy.
    - **Ongoing Test Porting:** Discussion on issue [#416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/416) confirmed that the port of `TestPectra` to devstack has been implemented, marking continued progress in modernizing the testing framework.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the coordinated effort to migrate from Etherscan to Blockscout, which involved discussion and approvals from multiple team members across issue [#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1696) and the subsequent pull request. Furthermore, the resolution of testing issues pointed to cross-team and cross-repository work, with one issue ([#298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/298)) being handed off to the Protocol team and another ([#16731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16731)) being addressed by a pull request in the main `optimism` repository.
