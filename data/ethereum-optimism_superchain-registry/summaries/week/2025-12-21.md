# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity focused on preparing for future releases and ensuring the stability of the development pipeline. A new release candidate version for the Superchain was introduced for mainnet and Sepolia, signaling progress toward the next iteration of standards. Key maintenance was performed on the CI system to align it with the main Optimism repository. Additionally, a significant issue regarding the `op-node` light client was closed, confirming the completion of its implementation to follow external data sources.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this period centered on release preparation and CI maintenance.

- **Superchain Standard Versioning:** A new standard version, `v6.0.0-rc.1`, was added for both mainnet and Sepolia. This update prepares the registry for an upcoming release candidate, marking a step forward in the Superchain's evolution ([#1187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1187)).

- **CI Configuration Alignment:** A maintenance fix was merged to update `circleci-utils`. This change ensures the CI configuration in this repository is consistent with that of the main Optimism repository, promoting stability and predictability in the build and test pipeline ([#1188](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1188)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management saw the resolution of a key implementation task and ongoing discussion on the fault-proof system.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - The issue tracking the `op-node` light client's ability to follow external sources for safe and finalized data was closed. This confirms that the implementation within `op-node` is now complete ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18317)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were opened.
  - Discussion continues on an active issue concerning the `op-challenger`'s behavior when a super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18643)). The latest updates confirm that the super node trace provider now handles this scenario correctly. While the `op-supervisor` component will not be fixed due to its planned deletion, the issue remains open pending an integration test to verify the alignment between `op-challenger` and `op-program`.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Based on the available data, development activity was focused and internal. The primary area of collaboration was the ongoing technical discussion within issue [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18643), where team members are working to finalize the behavior of the fault challenge system.
