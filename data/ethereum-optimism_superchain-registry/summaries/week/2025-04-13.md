# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Apr 13 - 19, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This was a quiet week for code contributions, with development activity centered on planning for future improvements to the registry's maintainability. The primary focus was on optimizing chain configuration management. A key proposal was introduced to streamline how contract addresses are handled, aiming to reduce the potential for stale configurations and improve the overall accuracy of the registry.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
There were no new features, bug fixes, or other code changes merged into the repository this week. The development focus was on identifying areas for architectural improvement rather than implementing new code.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The week's activity was concentrated on issue management, with a focus on enhancing the configuration process.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:** A significant new issue was opened to address the maintainability of chain configurations.
  - **Chain Configuration Optimization ([#978](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/978)):** A proposal was made to reduce the number of addresses stored in the chain configuration `.toml` files. The suggestion is to read frequently changing contract and role addresses from the `addresses.json` codegen file instead, preventing the `.toml` files from becoming stale and difficult to maintain.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community interaction was minimal this week, with no pull requests opened or significant discussions on existing issues. The primary activity consisted of the single new issue being filed, indicating a period of reflection and planning for future development work.
