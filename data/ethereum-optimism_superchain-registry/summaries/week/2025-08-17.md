# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by significant progress in bolstering the Superchain's operational stability and testing infrastructure. Key achievements include the successful rollout of flashblocks for all Sunnyside sequencers, enhancing network resilience. The team also closed out several long-standing issues related to the proofs system and acceptance testing, clearing technical debt and improving protocol reliability. Alongside these infrastructure wins, routine maintenance continued with registry updates, and work began on integrating Celo-sepolia, signaling ongoing ecosystem growth.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on registry maintenance and expansion, ensuring the data remains current and the Superchain continues to grow.

- **Registry Data Synchronization:** Codegen results were updated to synchronize `chainList.json`, `chainList.toml`, and `superchain/extra/addresses/addresses.json` with the latest onchain data, ensuring the registry's accuracy ([#1098](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1098)).
- **Celo Integration:** A new pull request was opened to integrate Celo-sepolia into the Superchain Registry, representing the initial steps for adding a new chain to the ecosystem ([#1099](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1099)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of major operational and testing issues, while new discussions centered on CI improvements and community contributions.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Enabled:** A critical operational issue was resolved by enabling flashblocks for all Sunnyside sequencers on Sepolia, with successful failover testing completed ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16688)).
    - **Acceptance Testing Milestones:** Several major testing epics were concluded. This includes closing issues for adding proofs system acceptance tests ([#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15946)) and `op-challenger` tests ([#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15948)), marking a significant improvement in test coverage.
    - **System Cleanup:** An issue to remove two events from the event system was closed ([#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17001)), and an older issue regarding test target setup was closed after a re-evaluation of testing strategies ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/375)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Missing CI Logs:** A new issue was opened regarding missing logs in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17151)). It was quickly clarified that the tests were running in an incorrect workflow, and a plan is in place to move them, which is expected to resolve the issue.
    - **RPC Response Bug:** An ongoing discussion regarding missing content types in RPC responses ([#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/389)) saw renewed community interest, with a user asking for guidance on how to contribute a fix.
    - **Contract Verification:** A long-term discussion on improving contract verification ([#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/14813)) continued, with a proposal to leverage `forge verify-contract` in the future to simplify the process.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both internal issue resolution and external community engagement. The rapid clarification and proposed solution for the missing test logs issue ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17151)) highlighted effective team communication. Furthermore, the event system cleanup ([#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17001)) required linking to work in the main `optimism` repository, demonstrating cross-project coordination. Community interest in contributing was visible in the RPC content type issue ([#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/389)), where a user actively sought to help resolve a problem affecting tools like wagmi.
