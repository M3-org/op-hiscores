# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Nov 30 - 6, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week saw significant progress in preparing for ZK fault proofs, with a series of issues closed related to the `op-challenger`'s functionality and proof generation strategy. This work marks a key step towards enhancing the Superchain's security mechanisms. Alongside routine maintenance, development began on improving the chain addition process. However, community reports highlighted ongoing stability concerns with `op-node`, specifically around synchronization and block validation, which appear to be blocking some node operators.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this period focused on both routine maintenance and new feature development to enhance chain management.

- **Automated Registry Maintenance:** The project saw two automated codegen updates ([#1171](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1171), [#1173](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1173)) which modified `addresses.json`. These routine updates ensure the registry remains synchronized with the latest contract deployments and configurations.

- **Chain Configuration Enhancements:** A new pull request ([#1172](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1172)) was opened to introduce support for embedded contract artifacts. This feature aims to streamline the process of adding a new chain to the registry.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was characterized by the resolution of a major workstream around ZK challengers and active discussions on critical node stability problems.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Advancements in ZK Challenger Functionality:** A significant cluster of issues related to ZK fault proofs was closed, indicating a major milestone. The strategy for ZK proof generation was finalized, with the task assigned to the succinct proposer ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18319)). Key development work was completed to enable the `op-challenger` to support ZK game types ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18321)). Additionally, a suite of improvements to the challenger was finalized, including enhanced test coverage, bond fetching, and address handling ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18427), [#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18412), [#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18413), [#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18414), [#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18415)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **`op-node` Stability Concerns:** Several active issues point to ongoing stability challenges for node operators. A user reported that their Base Mainnet node is blocked because `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18468)). Separately, discussion continued on an `op-node` invalid block signature error, with another user confirming they are experiencing the same problem ([#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17448)).
  - **Other Active Discussions:** Planning for a fix for the `proxyd` backwards time travel bug ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/501)) is underway, with work scheduled to begin in January 2026. Discussions also continued around adding acceptance tests for new EIPs ([#18221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18221)) and the potential closure of an issue regarding unused OP constants ([#13440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/13440)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was evident in the active issue discussions, particularly concerning `op-node` stability. Users provided valuable feedback by reporting bugs ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18468)) and confirming existing ones ([#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17448)), highlighting a crucial feedback loop between node operators and the development team. Internal collaboration was also visible in the coordination on future work, such as the planned fix for the `proxyd` issue ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/501)) between contributors `joshklop` and `yashvardhan-kukreja`.
