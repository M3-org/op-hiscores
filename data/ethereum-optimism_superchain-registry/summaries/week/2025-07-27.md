# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity in the `superchain-registry` was characterized by ongoing design discussions and ecosystem growth rather than major code changes. Development focused on advancing the "Min Base Fee" feature, with progress tracked across multiple repositories including `optimism`, `op-alloy`, and `reth`. A proposal to add a new mainnet chain to the Superchain was initiated, and community members showed active interest in collaborating on future protocol enhancements like congestion-based transaction reordering. The only merged code change was a minor bug fix, reflecting a period of steady maintenance and strategic planning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on minor maintenance, with most effort directed towards planning and discussion for future features.

*   **Configuration Fixes:** A minor bug was addressed by correcting a comment error in the standard configuration parameter files for both mainnet and Sepolia (`standard-config-params-mainnet.toml` and `standard-config-params-sepolia.toml`) in PR [#1089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1089).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Discussions on active issues were the primary focus this week, with significant progress on feature planning and a new proposal to expand the Superchain.

*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **New Chain Proposal:** A pull request ([#1091](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1091)) was opened to add the "Silent Data mainnet chain" to the registry, signaling continued growth of the Superchain ecosystem.
    *   **Min Base Fee Tracking:** Discussion continued on issue [#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16807) to track the implementation of the "Min Base Fee" feature. Updates highlighted in-flight work in the `op-alloy` and `optimism` repositories, as well as an early `reth` draft for review. Related discussion on a closed issue ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/742)) centered on the need to estimate the state growth implied by this feature, which is now being tracked in a separate design document.
    *   **Congestion-Based Reordering:** Issue [#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/306), which proposes a design for congestion-based builder transaction reordering, saw renewed interest from the community.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted active collaboration both within the core team and with the broader community.

*   The ongoing work on the "Min Base Fee" feature ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16807)) demonstrates significant cross-repository coordination, with contributor `wlawt` tracking related pull requests across the `optimism`, `op-alloy`, and `reth` projects.
*   Community engagement was evident in the discussion on congestion-based transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/306)), where community member `moonfury-ops` expressed interest in collaborating on the design document.
