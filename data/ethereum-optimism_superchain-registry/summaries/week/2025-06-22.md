# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on network upgrades, performance optimization, and developer tooling. A key milestone was reached with the completion of flashblocks acceptance testing and its subsequent enablement on a test environment. Significant progress was also made in diagnosing a memory consumption issue in the `op-batcher`, with detailed analysis identifying the root cause and proposing concrete optimization strategies. Finally, a hardfork time was officially set for Swell Mainnet, ensuring the chain is prepared for future network upgrades.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on preparing chains for future upgrades and improving the developer environment.

- **Superchain Configuration Updates**
  - The Holocene hardfork time was configured for Swell Mainnet, a crucial step for scheduling and aligning with future network-wide upgrades ([#1082](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1082)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Discussions this week tackled performance bottlenecks and developer tooling, while several key issues related to feature integration and environment improvements were resolved.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks Integration:** A major effort concluded with the closure of issues related to flashblocks. Acceptance tests, including transfer and streaming tests, were completed ([#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/354)), and flashblocks were enabled on the `eris-0` environment for confidence building ([#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16468)).
  - **Developer Environment & CI:** Improvements were made to the Supersim development environment, which now supports modifying the `L2toL2CDM` predeploy ([#393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/393)). A discussion on implementing CI SLAs was concluded with the decision not to proceed at this time ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16437)). A broken documentation link was also fixed ([#283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/283)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **`op-batcher` Memory Optimization:** A significant investigation is underway to address memory consumption in the `op-batcher` ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16537), [#16572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16572)). Analysis using `pprof` has identified the compressor within the publishing loop as the primary source of memory usage during backlogs. Proposed solutions include optimizing the shadow compressor and discarding the main compressor more eagerly after channel submission.
  - **Developer Tooling Discussions:** A discussion clarified the distinct purposes of Supersim (for local dapp/interop testing) and the Interop Kurtosis Devnet (for chain development) ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/399)). A new feature request to enable event logging for user-specified contracts in Supersim was well-received ([#411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/411)).
  - **Withdrawal Pathways:** An ongoing discussion about testing withdrawal pathways for superchain output roots is seeking clarification on which devnet environment to use ([#821](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/821)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the deep technical dive into the `op-batcher` memory issue ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16537)), where detailed performance analysis and potential solutions were shared. The community also showed a focus on improving developer experience through clarifying the roles of different testing tools ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/399)) and proposing valuable new features for Supersim ([#411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/411)).
