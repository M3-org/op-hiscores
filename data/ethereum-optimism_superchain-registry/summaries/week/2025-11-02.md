# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on preparing for upcoming protocol upgrades and enhancing the robustness of core components. Development focused on updating configurations for the Jovian hardfork and adding prestates for Kona, indicating steady progress on the protocol roadmap. Simultaneously, significant discussions took place around improving the `op-batcher`'s transaction fee management and configuration handling, as well as tackling a complex time synchronization issue in `proxyd`. This blend of preparatory configuration work and deep architectural discussion highlights a dual focus on immediate roadmap execution and long-term system stability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week primarily involved configuration management for protocol upgrades and minor tooling improvements.

- **Protocol Upgrade Configurations:**
  - The Jovian activation timestamp was pushed back by one week across numerous Mainnet and Sepolia chains to December 2, 2025, providing additional preparation time ([#1140]).
  - In preparation for future upgrades, the `op-program` v1.8.0-rc.4 prestate was added ([#1142]), and MIPS/OPCM deployment versions were updated for both Mainnet and Sepolia ([#1141]).
  - A new pull request was opened to add "kona" to the standard prestates validation, signaling its integration into the testing pipeline ([#1144]).

- **Automated Maintenance & Tooling:**
  - Routine automated code generation updates were committed throughout the week to keep generated files synchronized ([#1138], [#1139]).
  - The daily codegen pull request message was improved to provide more context for reviewers by highlighting which files to check ([#1143]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Discussions this week surfaced key areas for improvement in core services, while a couple of older issues were resolved.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - An issue regarding reporting unused acceptance tests was closed as the team has largely moved to a "gateless mode" for testing, making the original requirement obsolete ([#16273]).
  - A broken dependency issue in `op-chain-ops` was resolved, unblocking related development ([#16612]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **`op-batcher` Enhancements:** Two key discussions focused on the `op-batcher`.
    - A new issue was opened concerning the batcher's brittle behavior of only fetching the rollup configuration once at startup. Suggestions include making the config an explicit operator-provided parameter or having it reload when the active endpoint changes ([#18178]).
    - Discussion continued on improving blob priority fee tracking, with a proposal to have the starting fee "decay" from the previous transaction's fee as a "quick win" to better handle backlogs, though its limitations were also noted ([#18102]).
  - **`proxyd` Time Travel Problem:** A significant discussion continued around mitigating "backwards time travel" when backends are out of sync. Proposed solutions include a "multicall" strategy, making `proxyd` aware of "block out of range" errors, and implementing sticky sessions. The potential impact on `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory` remains a key concern ([#501]).
  - **Acceptance Testing:** The need to add support for flashblocks/rbuilders to `op-acceptance-tests` was reiterated to help validate `kona-node` and `rollup-boost` changes ([#16450]).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week was characterized by deep, collaborative problem-solving on complex technical issues. The active discussions on `op-batcher` behavior ([#18178], [#18102]) and the `proxyd` time travel problem ([#501]) demonstrate a proactive approach to identifying and addressing architectural weaknesses. The immediate and detailed feedback on the newly opened `op-batcher` synchronization issue highlights a healthy and responsive feedback loop within the development team. This focus on foundational improvements suggests a strong commitment to the long-term security and reliability of the Superchain infrastructure.
