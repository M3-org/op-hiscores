# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by significant refinement and housekeeping across the Superchain Registry. Development efforts focused on enhancing protocol stability and improving registry management tooling, highlighted by the introduction of bounds for minimum base fees on mainnet and Sepolia. A major effort was undertaken to triage the issue backlog, resulting in the closure of numerous stale and post-refactor issues, while also systematically identifying and reopening issues tied to remaining `TODO`s in the codebase. This dual focus on new configuration, tooling, and clearing technical debt marks a period of consolidation and stabilization for the project.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving registry management, refining protocol configurations, and performing routine maintenance.

- **Registry Management & Tooling:**
  - To improve operational efficiency, a new `just remove-chain` command was added to simplify the process of removing all chain artifacts from the registry ([#1158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1158)).
  - As part of ongoing maintenance, the deprecated `snax` chain was removed from the mainnet configuration and associated files ([#1157](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1157)).

- **Protocol Configuration:**
  - To enhance fee market stability and predictability, bounds for minimum base fees were added to the standard configurations for both mainnet and Sepolia ([#1127](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1127), [#1163](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1163)).

- **Routine Maintenance & Documentation:**
  - Several automated code generation updates were merged to ensure files like `addresses.json` remain current ([#1156](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1156), [#1161](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1161), [#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1162)).
  - Minor documentation improvements were proposed to fix grammar in the glossary and correct a broken link ([#1159](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1159), [#1160](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1160)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The week saw a significant effort to clean up and organize the project's issue tracker, closing out old items while ensuring active work is properly tracked.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Stale Issue Cleanup:** A large number of long-standing issues were closed due to age or irrelevance, addressing topics such as L2 network divergence ([#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15782)), `op-node` goroutine problems ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16332)), and a flaky test that is no longer observed ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17966)).
  - **Post-Refactor Resolution:** Several issues related to the Superchain Registry 2.0 refactor were formally closed, as their requirements were fulfilled by the update. This included work on the `add-chain` tool ([#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/610)) and `ProxyAdminOwner` exceptions ([#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/675)).
  - **Strategic Decisions:** An issue to conduct simulations for the `min-base-fee` feature ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16958)) was closed, with the team opting to observe its performance in production instead.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No major new issues were opened this week. The primary focus was on triaging the existing backlog.
  - A notable trend was the systematic re-opening of several previously closed issues. This was consistently due to the discovery of outstanding `TODO` comments in the codebase that referenced them. This indicates a thorough effort to align the issue tracker with remaining technical debt. Re-opened issues touch on Interop mechanisms ([#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16140), [#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16141)), `op-supervisor` support ([#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16174)), and `op-devstack` tooling ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15817)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week's activity demonstrates a strong internal focus on project health and maintenance. The issue triage process was particularly collaborative; for example, `mslipper` initiated reviews of many older issues, while `ajsutton` followed up by cross-referencing them with the codebase, leading to the re-opening of issues like [#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15817) to address lingering `TODO`s. This dynamic highlights a thorough and cooperative approach to managing technical debt and ensuring the issue tracker accurately reflects the state of the project.
