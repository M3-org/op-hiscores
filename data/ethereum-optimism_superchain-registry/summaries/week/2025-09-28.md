# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Sep 28 - 4, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's focus was on expanding the Superchain and hardening existing systems. The Silent Data mainnet was officially added to the registry, continuing the growth of the ecosystem. A major operational milestone was achieved with the successful deployment of Flashblocks on op-mainnet, accompanied by comprehensive documentation and operational runbooks. Concurrently, an important compatibility issue with Go 1.25 affecting Cannon's cryptographic functions has been identified as a key area of active investigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on registry additions and version updates.

- **Superchain Registry Expansion:** The registry grew with the addition of the Silent Data mainnet. This included its chain configuration and genesis data, formally incorporating it into the Superchain ([#1091](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1091)).
- **Standard Version Updates:** A new standard version for `op-contracts/v4.1.0` was added for both Sepolia and Mainnet, mirroring the `v4.1.0-rc.3` configuration to standardize contract versions ([#1109](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1109)).

A pull request was also opened to update the `CHAINS.md` documentation file ([#1108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1108)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was dominated by the closure of tasks related to the Flashblocks deployment and a critical active discussion on Go compatibility.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Deployment:** A significant cluster of issues related to Flashblocks was resolved. This included enabling the feature on op-mainnet ([#16498](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16498)), completing on-call onboarding and documentation ([#17142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17142)), refining alerts and runbooks ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17423)), and publishing a blog post on the deployment ([#17664](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17664)).
    - **Protocol Fixes & Testing:** A synchronization bug in the `op-node` EL sync code was fixed with proper locking ([#17564](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17564)), and the Fusaka activation test for L1 was completed ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17500)).
    - **Process & Architecture:** An issue to refactor the `op-node` CLI was closed as "not planned" after a spike did not gain support for a PR ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16680)). An older issue on negative testing for chain configurations was also closed, as the project's strategy has shifted from validation to reporting ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/686)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this week.
    - **Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17060)):** A significant active issue involves Go 1.25 causing incorrect Keccak hashes and potentially other crypto function failures within Cannon. A detailed diagnosis has been documented, linking it to a known Go issue. The recent Go 1.25.1 release does not appear to contain the necessary MIPS fix, making this a potential blocker requiring continued attention.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the coordinated effort to roll out Flashblocks. The closure of multiple related issues, spanning from mainnet activation to documentation, runbooks, and public communication via a blog post, highlights a well-orchestrated feature deployment. Additionally, the deep diagnostic work on the Cannon compatibility issue ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17060)), including a detailed Notion document, points to focused, in-depth technical investigation within the team.
