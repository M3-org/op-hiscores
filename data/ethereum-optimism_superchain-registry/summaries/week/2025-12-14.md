# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on preparing the Superchain for future upgrades and addressing critical stability issues. Key progress was made in activating upcoming hardforks for Cyber and Funki Mainnets, scheduling them for early January 2026. Concurrently, significant attention was given to triaging high-priority bugs, including a critical fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2` and P2P connection instability between `op-reth` and `op-geth` nodes. Discussions also advanced on node synchronization problems, ZK proof optimizations, and the finalization of the upcoming Upgrade 18 release.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this period focused on updating Superchain configurations and preparing for network upgrades.

- **Superchain Hardfork Activations:** Preparations were made for upcoming network upgrades by activating several hardforks. For Cyber Mainnet, the Fjord, Granite, and Holocene hardforks were scheduled ([#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1183)). For Funki Mainnet, the Granite and Holocene hardforks were scheduled ([#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1182)). Both sets of activations are timed for early January 2026.
- **Standard Prestate Updates:** The Kona version 1.2.7 was added to the `standard-prestates.toml` configuration, ensuring standard chain states are up-to-date ([#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1184)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened, but significant discussion and triage occurred on existing ones, highlighting several critical areas needing attention.

- **Closed Issues:** An issue related to fault proof system testing ([#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17348)) was closed but immediately reopened due to an outstanding task, resulting in no net resolved issues.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Critical Bugs Identified:** Two issues were flagged as critical. A fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when the target is `address(0)` ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18554)) was prioritized for an immediate fix. Separately, P2P connection flakiness between `op-reth` and `op-geth` nodes ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18570)) was deemed a major bug impacting client diversity.
    - **Node Stability and Compatibility:** Discussions continued on several stability problems. A user reported "missing trie node" errors, pointing to a potential node synchronization issue with the L1 Execution Client ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581)). Another report detailed a panic in `op-challenger` when connected to an L1 that does not support `blobBaseFee`, likely due to an uninitialized field ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18608)).
    - **Future Upgrades and Optimizations:** Progress on the Upgrade 18 release is being tracked in [#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18548), with updates requested on governance approval. Discussions on optimizing `kona-sp1` for ZK Proofs by offloading expensive operations to the host continued in [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18533).
    - **Proof System Design:** A discussion regarding the necessity of injected replacement transactions for the proof system concluded that the additional transaction is critical for preventing honest challengers from being overwhelmed ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18574)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The activity this period highlights a healthy feedback loop between users and maintainers. Users provided detailed reports on node stability and component failures ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581), [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18608)), which were met with requests for further diagnostic information. The internal triage process was also visible in discussions, with clear prioritization and assignment suggestions for critical bugs ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18554), [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18570)), demonstrating active coordination to maintain ecosystem health.
