# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on preparing for future network upgrades and addressing critical system stability issues. Key progress was made in scheduling hardforks for Cyber and Funki Mainnets, setting the stage for their activation in early 2026. Concurrently, significant attention was dedicated to investigating and diagnosing several high-priority issues, including a critical bug in `OptimismPortal2`, an `op-challenger` panic on non-Dencun L1s, and P2P connection instability between client implementations. This reflects a dual focus on proactive network evolution and ensuring the robustness of core protocol components.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Development work focused on updating Superchain configurations to enable upcoming network features.

- **Superchain Hardfork Activations:** Preparations were made to activate several hardforks across multiple chains, all scheduled for early January 2026. For Cyber Mainnet, the Fjord, Granite, and Holocene hardforks were activated ([#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1183)). For Funki Mainnet, the Granite and Holocene hardforks were activated ([#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1182)).
- **Configuration Updates:** The Kona version 1.2.7 was added to the `standard-prestates.toml` configuration file, keeping the registry aligned with the latest releases ([#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1184)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The week saw no new pull requests or issues opened, with activity concentrated on diagnosing and discussing existing high-priority issues.

- **Closed Issues:** No major issues were resolved this week. Issue [#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17348), related to fault proof system testing, was briefly closed but then reopened, indicating that work remains ongoing.

- **New & Active Issues:** Discussions on active issues highlighted several critical areas requiring attention:
    - **Critical Bugs & Stability:**
        - A critical bug in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18554)) was identified through fuzz testing, where a null address causes a failure. The issue has been recommended for immediate prioritization and security review.
        - An `op-challenger` panic ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18608)) was confirmed to occur when running against an L1 that has not upgraded to Dencun, as it attempts to access the non-existent `BlobBaseFee` field.
        - P2P connection flakiness between `op-reth` and `op-geth` ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18570)) continues to impact system test stability, with calls to prioritize an investigation into implementation differences.
    - **Protocol Design & Releases:**
        - Discussion on interoperability ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18574)) affirmed the necessity of an additional transaction for the proof system to function correctly.
        - The finalization of the U18 releases ([#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18548)) is being tracked, pending governance approval for `op-program`.
    - **Node Operations & Performance:**
        - Investigation continues into node synchronization failures ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581)), with current evidence pointing towards issues with L1 Execution Client data.
        - The effort to optimize `kona-sp1` for ZK Proofs ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18533)) is ongoing, with a focus on identifying all expensive operations that need to be offloaded to the host.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly visible within the issue tracker, where detailed debugging and technical discussions took place. The thorough reporting and follow-up on issues like the `op-challenger` panic ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18608)) and node sync problems ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581)) demonstrate effective collaboration between community reporters and project maintainers in diagnosing complex problems. Furthermore, strategic discussions around bug prioritization ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18554)) and protocol design ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18574)) reflect a healthy and engaged process for technical decision-making.
