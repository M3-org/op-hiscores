# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's progress centered on expanding the Superchain ecosystem while actively investigating critical node stability issues. The registry grew with the addition of Celo Sepolia and was updated to support new op-program prestates and KONA game types, enhancing interoperability. Concurrently, significant effort was dedicated to diagnosing and discussing complex problems, including widespread node synchronization failures and a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer recovery mode. This dual focus on growth and stability underscores the project's commitment to maintaining a robust and expanding network.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The week saw a blend of registry expansion, routine maintenance, and protocol logic updates.

- **Superchain Registry Expansion:**
  - Celo Sepolia was officially added to the Superchain, including its necessary configuration and genesis files, broadening the network of supported chains ([#1116](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1116)).
  - The registry was updated to include prestates for the finalized `op-program` v1.8.0 release and the v1.9.0-rc.1 release candidate, ensuring compatibility with the latest protocol versions ([#1176](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1176)).
  - A new pull request was opened to add `op-contracts/v5.0.0` to the standard versions, preparing for future contract deployments ([#1181](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1181)).

- **Protocol and Tooling Updates:**
  - The logic for generating `chainList.json` was refined to recognize chains using game type 8 (KONA-CANNON) as permissionless, improving how chains are identified and categorized ([#1179](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1179)).

- **Automated Maintenance:**
  - Several automated codegen updates were merged throughout the week ([#1177](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1177), [#1178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1178), [#1180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1180)), performing routine maintenance on `addresses.json`, `chainList.json`, and `chainList.toml` to keep registry data current.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
While no new issues were opened, significant progress was made on resolving existing problems and investigating active, high-priority bugs.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - An `op-node` synchronization failure affecting multiple chains after an upgrade was resolved by upgrading and resyncing `op-geth`, highlighting the tight coupling between stack components ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18510)).
  - Documentation was improved by closing two issues: one clarifying the JSON-RPC API documentation for `op-node` and `op-geth` ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1773)), and another adding missing environment variable descriptions ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1874)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Node Synchronization Failures:** A critical active issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581)) is tracking widespread node synchronization problems, with users reporting "missing trie node" errors across Base, Optimism, and Unichain, particularly when using snapshots. Investigation is ongoing, with maintainers requesting detailed client configurations and logs to diagnose the root cause.
  - **Sequencer Stability:** Discussion continues on a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer recovery mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18350)) that could lead to derivation stalls. The investigation is exploring how the sequencer handles non-existent L1 origin blocks and the influence of async L1 fetching.
  - **Proposed Enhancements:** Discussions on future work saw contributors volunteer for key tasks, including simplifying the batcher by removing `isPectra` ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18479)) and creating a dedicated replica-healthcheck for `op-rbuilder` to prevent divergence from `op-geth` ([#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17685)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted a proactive and collaborative community focused on both feature development and critical bug hunting. In several active issues ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18479), [#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17685)), contributor `Himess` took the initiative to volunteer for complex tasks, demonstrating a strong sense of ownership. Furthermore, the detailed technical discussions around node synchronization ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581)) and sequencer recovery mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18350)) showcase deep engagement, with community members and maintainers working together to diagnose and solve challenging systemic issues.
