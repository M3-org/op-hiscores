# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts focused on both expanding the Superchain ecosystem and addressing critical node-level stability. The registry grew with the addition of Celo Sepolia, and internal logic was enhanced to recognize the KONA game type for permissionless chains. Alongside these additions, the team performed routine maintenance by updating prestates and contract versions. Significant attention was also directed toward investigating complex active issues, including a potential `op-node` sequencer bug and widespread node synchronization failures, highlighting a dual focus on growth and operational reliability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on registry expansion, configuration updates, and routine maintenance to keep the Superchain definition current.

- **Superchain Expansion & Configuration:**
  - Celo Sepolia was officially added to the Superchain, expanding the ecosystem with its complete configuration files and updated chain lists ([#1116]).
  - The code generation logic was improved to recognize KONA (game type 8) as a valid game type for identifying permissionless chains, ensuring `chainList.json` is generated correctly ([#1179]).

- **Registry Maintenance & Updates:**
  - The registry was updated with finalized op-program prestates for the `1.8.0` release and the `1.9.0-rc.1` release candidate, keeping it aligned with the latest protocol versions ([#1176]).
  - A new pull request was opened to add `op-contracts/v5.0.0+l2-rev-share-contracts` to the standard versions, preparing the registry for upcoming contract deployments ([#1181]).
  - Several automated codegen updates ([#1177], [#1178], [#1180]) were merged, ensuring that `chainList.json`, `chainList.toml`, and `addresses.json` remained up-to-date throughout the week.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
This week saw the resolution of several documentation and node operation issues, while significant investigation began on complex, active bugs.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Documentation:** Key documentation gaps were filled by updating the JSON-RPC API documentation ([#1773]) and adding missing environment variable descriptions for `op-node` and `op-geth` flags ([#1874]).
  - **Node Operation:** An `op-node` synchronization failure reported after an upgrade was resolved; the fix involved upgrading and resyncing `op-geth` ([#18510]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Node Stability Investigations:** Discussions intensified around several critical issues.
    - **`op-node` Sequencer Bug ([#18350]):** Investigation continues into a potential bug in the sequencer recovery mode that could lead to derivation stalls. The team is analyzing related pull requests to understand the root cause.
    - **Node Synchronization Failures ([#18581]):** A high-priority issue emerged with multiple users reporting nodes failing to sync across Base, Optimism, and Unichain, particularly when using public snapshots. Maintainers are actively collecting logs and configurations to diagnose the problem.
  - **Future Work & Refactoring:**
    - **`op-rbuilder` Healthcheck ([#17685]):** A proposal for a dedicated healthcheck to ensure `op-rbuilder` does not diverge from `op-geth` gained momentum, with a contributor expressing interest in implementing it.
    - **Batcher Simplification ([#18479]):** Discussions progressed on refactoring the batcher by removing the `isPectra` flag, with a contributor volunteering to take on the task.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was prominent this week, particularly in the collaborative triage of complex technical issues. Contributors played an active role, with "Himess" volunteering to tackle the proposed `op-rbuilder` healthcheck ([#17685]) and the batcher simplification task ([#18479]). The detailed discussions in issues like the `op-node` sequencer bug ([#18350]) and node sync failures ([#18581]) highlight a strong feedback loop between users and maintainers, crucial for diagnosing and resolving core infrastructure challenges.
