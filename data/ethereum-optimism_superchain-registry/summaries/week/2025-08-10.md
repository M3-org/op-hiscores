# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Aug 10 - 16, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on maintenance, planning, and architectural discussions rather than new feature completion. A key proposal was submitted to update a contract address for Celo, reflecting ongoing chain integration efforts. A new initiative to migrate and clean up legacy tasks was started, signaling a focus on improving internal tooling. Notably, a significant discussion on a potential architectural shift emerged, with the team considering the deprecation of the event system, which could impact future contributions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No pull requests were merged or completed during this period. However, new work was proposed:

- **Chain Configuration:** A pull request ([#1095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1095)) was opened to update the `AnchorStateRegistryProxy` address for Celo, representing a proposed configuration update for one of the chains in the registry.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on task migration and a critical discussion about the project's event system architecture.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Task Migration:** A new issue ([#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1162)) was created to track the migration of blacklist games tasks to a new template and the removal of old FP recovery tasks.
    - **Architectural Discussion on Event System:** A significant conversation took place in issue [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16874). A contributor submitted a PR to add event flow tracing, but the team communicated that they are leaning towards removing the entire event system. This feedback, while likely meaning the PR won't be merged, provides important guidance for future contributors regarding the project's direction.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident through proactive communication and offers of assistance.

- On the new task migration issue ([#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1162)), a community member immediately offered to help with the work or review the eventual pull request.
- The discussion around the event system in [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16874) highlighted transparent communication between the core team and contributors, with the team providing clear context about strategic shifts that could affect a contributor's work.
