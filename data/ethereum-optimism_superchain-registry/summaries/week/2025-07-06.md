## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was the main activity this week, with key discussions leading to the resolution and closure of existing items.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Acceptance Testing:** An issue was resolved to update the flashblocks gate, ensuring acceptance tests correctly validate the stream from the new `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` ([#16630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16630)).
    - **`op-node` Interop Logic:** An issue exploring a mode for `op-node` to use pre-Interop logic was closed after discussion, with the conclusion that the work would no longer be prioritized ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16520)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this week.
    - Discussion on the active `op-node` issue ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16520)) involved considering alternative approaches before it was ultimately closed.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was focused within issue discussions. A notable conversation occurred on issue [#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16520), where contributor `tynes` provided input on potential implementation strategies for `op-node` logic before the issue was ultimately deprioritized. The activity reflects a period of planning and prioritization rather than active coding.
