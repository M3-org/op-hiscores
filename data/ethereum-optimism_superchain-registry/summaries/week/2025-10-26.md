# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity was dominated by preparations for the upcoming Jovian network upgrade, with a significant effort to update activation timestamps across numerous Mainnet and Sepolia configurations. Alongside this preparatory work, the team refined the registry by adding new `op-program` release candidate prestates and fixing configuration typos. Key operational and documentation issues were also resolved, while an important discussion progressed regarding an `op-batcher` fix in collaboration with the Celestia team.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on preparing for a major network upgrade and maintaining the integrity of the registry's data.

- **Jovian Upgrade Preparation:**
  - A major update set the Jovian activation timestamp to November 25, 2025, 16:00:01 UTC across 36 configuration files for both Mainnet and Sepolia networks, marking a critical step toward the upgrade ([#1130](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1130)). A related pull request ([#1131](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1131)) indicates this work is ongoing.

- **Registry Data and Configuration Updates:**
  - Prestates for three new `op-program` release candidates (1.8.0-rc.1, 1.8.0-rc.2, 1.8.0-rc.3) were added to the `standard-prestates.toml` file, ensuring the registry is up-to-date with the latest program versions ([#1133](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1133)).
  - A minor but important fix corrected a typo in the standard versions configuration files for Mainnet and Sepolia ([#1132](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1132)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on closing out documentation and operational tickets, while a key discussion on `op-batcher` improvements continued.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Tooling & Testing:** An issue regarding the need for more end-to-end testing for `op-deployer` was closed, as recent CLI-level integration tests have addressed the concern ([#16842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16842)).
  - **Documentation & Audits:** Several maintenance issues were resolved, including fixes for broken internal documentation links ([#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1802)), a general documentation ticket ([#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1797)), and an issue related to the Q4 2024 audit ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism-superchain-registry/issues/1789)).
  - **Operational Fixes:** A 30-second timeout on the Flashblocks websocket URL was investigated and closed, with fixes implemented in related repositories ([#17858](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17858)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were opened this week.
  - **`op-batcher` and AltDA Improvements:** Active discussion continued on issues [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17796) and [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17872). The conversation centers on upstreaming a fix from Celestia to address `op-batcher` frame size limits in generic mode. The proposed fix has been reviewed positively, and a request was made for the Celestia team to open a pull request.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the ongoing discussion around the `op-batcher` size fix ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17796), [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17872)). The interaction highlights a direct collaboration with the `celestiaorg` team, with a specific commit from their repository identified as a potential solution and a request for them to contribute it upstream via a pull request. This demonstrates healthy cross-project communication to improve shared components.
