# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December's development focused on advancing Zero-Knowledge (ZK) integration and addressing critical node synchronization issues. Significant progress was marked by the closure of numerous issues related to ZK proof generation and `op-challenger` support, clarifying the path forward for these components. However, the project also contended with persistent `op-node` synchronization bugs affecting users, which became a key area for active debugging and community support. Alongside routine registry maintenance, the month was also characterized by strong community engagement, with new contributors stepping up to tackle a variety of open issues.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on registry configuration updates and foundational enhancements for chain management.

- **Registry Maintenance and Configuration:**
  - Routine automated code generation updates were applied to keep the registry's `addresses.json` file current ([#1171](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1171), [#1173](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1173)).
  - The configuration was updated to include Kona 1.2.5 prestates in `standard-prestates.toml`, ensuring support for the new version ([#1174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1174)).

- **Chain Operation Enhancements:**
  - A new pull request was opened to improve the 'add chain' operation by enabling support for embedded contract artifacts, streamlining the process of adding new chains to the registry ([#1172](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1172)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
A significant cluster of issues related to ZK proofs and the `op-challenger` were resolved, indicating a major step forward in this area of the Superchain's technical priorities.

- **Progress on ZK Proofs and Challenger Implementation:**
  - Key decisions were finalized, with the closure of an issue investigating which service should generate ZK proofs ([#18319]).
  - The `op-challenger` was enhanced to support ZK game types ([#18321]).
  - Several related `op-challenger` improvements were completed, including better test coverage ([#18427]), reading from the DGF registry ([#18412]), and dynamically handling challenger bonds and addresses ([#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18413), [#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18414), [#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18415)).

### New & Active Issues
Discussions were dominated by critical synchronization bugs and planning for future work, highlighting both immediate challenges and long-term development goals.

- **Critical `op-node` Synchronization Bugs:**
  - A recurring and impactful issue is the `op-node` getting stuck in EL sync mode, particularly after a restart with an already-synced execution layer like Reth ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18468)). This has been reported to block a Base Mainnet node.
  - A related issue involves `op-node` v1.16.3 failing to synchronize after a restart ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18510)). Maintainers are actively debugging with users to gather more detailed logs and metrics.

- **Ongoing Discussions and Future Work:**
  - The `proxyd` "backwards time travel" issue ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/501)), where out-of-sync backends can cause `proxyd` to serve stale blocks, remains active. A plan was established to prioritize a fix starting in January.
  - A new `op-spammer` component for devnet deployments is under discussion ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18482)), with community members referencing prior art to inform the design.
  - A new issue was opened to track a webhook integration ([#1175](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1175)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The project saw healthy collaboration and a welcome influx of contributor interest this month.

- **New Contributor Engagement:** A new contributor, "Himess," showed significant initiative by expressing interest in tackling a wide array of issues. These ranged from documentation corrections ([#13435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/13435), [#13436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/13436)) to more complex bug fixes ([#15220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15220)) and refactoring work ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18479)).

- **Collaborative Debugging:** The active `op-node` synchronization issues ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18510)) have become a point of collaboration, with maintainer "geoknee" working directly with the reporter to diagnose the problem and requesting specific logs and metrics. This user-maintainer feedback loop is crucial for resolving complex bugs.
