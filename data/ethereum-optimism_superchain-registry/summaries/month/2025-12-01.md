# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December was a month of significant expansion and refinement for the Superchain. The registry grew with the addition of Celo Sepolia, and preparations were made for upcoming hardforks on Cyber and Funki Mainnets. Development saw major progress in ZK-related components, with numerous issues related to ZK proof generation and challenger support being closed. However, node stability and synchronization emerged as a recurring challenge, with multiple users reporting issues that sparked active troubleshooting discussions. The month was characterized by a blend of strategic network growth, foundational ZK development, and responsive community support.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month focused on expanding the Superchain, preparing for network upgrades, and performing routine maintenance to keep the registry current.

-   **Superchain Expansion & Configuration:**
    -   The Superchain was expanded with the addition of Celo Sepolia, including its full configuration and genesis files, enhancing the network's interoperability ([#1116](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1116)).
    -   Hardforks were scheduled for early January 2026 on Cyber Mainnet (Fjord, Granite, Holocene) and Funki Mainnet (Granite, Holocene), with their activation times being configured in the registry ([#1182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1182), [#1183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1183)).
    -   The logic for identifying permissionless chains was updated to recognize chains using the KONA-CANNON game type, ensuring `chainList.json` remains accurate ([#1179](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1179)).

-   **Registry Maintenance & Versioning:**
    -   The registry was consistently updated with new prestates for op-program versions 1.8.0 and 1.9.0-rc.1 ([#1176](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1176)) and Kona versions 1.2.5 and 1.2.7 ([#1174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1174), [#1184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1184)).
    -   Automated code generation jobs ran throughout the month, ensuring that `addresses.json`, `chainList.json`, and `chainList.toml` were kept up-to-date with the latest configurations ([#1171](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1171), [#1173](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1173), [#1177](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1177), [#1178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1178), [#1180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1180)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue tracking this month highlighted significant progress in ZK components, while also surfacing critical bugs and persistent node synchronization problems for operators.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **ZK & Challenger Progress:** A large batch of issues related to ZK proof generation and the `op-challenger` was closed. This work clarified that the succinct proposer will generate ZK proofs and confirmed that the challenger now supports ZK game types, can read from the DGF registry, and can handle bond fetching and address changes ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18319), [#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18321), [#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18412), [#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18413)).
    -   **Node & Documentation Fixes:** An `op-node` synchronization failure after an upgrade was resolved by resyncing `op-geth` ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18510)). Several documentation gaps were also addressed, improving information on JSON-RPC APIs and environment variables ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1773), [#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1874)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Node Synchronization Problems:** A major theme this month was node operators experiencing synchronization failures. Issues like `op-node` getting stuck in EL sync mode ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18468)) and nodes failing to build payloads with "missing trie node" errors ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18581)) were actively discussed, with maintainers requesting detailed logs to diagnose the root causes.
    -   **Critical Bug Identification:** Several high-priority bugs were identified and discussed. These include a fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when using the null address ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18554)) and P2P connection flakiness between `op-reth` and `op-geth` nodes in system tests ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18570)).
    -   **Ongoing Investigations:** Discussions continued on long-standing and complex issues, including a potential bug in `op-node` sequencer recovery mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18350)) and the `proxyd` "backwards time travel" problem ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/501)), for which work has been scheduled for January.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was strong in December, with notable contributions in issue triage and development interest.

-   A particularly active community member, "Himess," showed initiative by expressing interest in taking on a wide range of open issues, from contract function adjustments to batcher simplification and a new healthcheck for `op-rbuilder` ([#9697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/9697), [#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18479), [#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17685)).
-   Collaboration was evident in the handling of node synchronization issues, where maintainers like `geoknee` and `rdin777` actively engaged with users to gather diagnostic information and provide guidance.
-   Discussions around critical bugs, such as the `op-reth` P2P flakiness ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18570)), demonstrated a healthy process of community reporting, triage, and prioritization by the core team.
