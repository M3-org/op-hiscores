# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
June was a month of targeted enhancements and foundational work, with a strong focus on Superchain configuration, tooling refinement, and performance analysis. Key progress was made in preparing for the Flashblocks feature, with initial testing environments enabled and acceptance tests completed. The registry saw routine maintenance with updates for Swell Mainnet and code cleanup, while critical discussions emerged around `op-batcher` memory optimization and `op-supervisor` logic for fault proofs. These efforts reflect a dual focus on expanding Superchain capabilities while ensuring the core infrastructure remains robust and efficient.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development work this month centered on maintaining the integrity of the Superchain registry and improving CI/CD processes.

*   **Superchain Configuration and Maintenance:** The registry was actively managed to reflect the evolving ecosystem. A significant update set the Holocene hardfork time for Swell Mainnet ([#1082]), ensuring a smooth future upgrade. In a move toward data integrity, EthLockboxProxy consistency validation was re-enabled after an update to `op-fetcher` ([#1071]). Housekeeping efforts included opening pull requests to remove Celo from the chain list ([#1078]) and to clean up deprecated CGT-related code ([#1074]).

*   **CI/CD Workflow Improvements:** The continuous integration pipeline was optimized by modifying the CircleCI configuration. The `notify-when-chain-is-added-to-registry` workflow was adjusted to trigger exclusively on webhook events, preventing unnecessary runs and conserving resources ([#1073]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue tracking this month highlighted significant progress on Flashblocks integration, while opening up important new discussions on performance and core protocol logic.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Flashblocks Integration:** Major headway was made on Flashblocks, with the closure of issues related to enabling it on the `eris-0` environment ([#16468]) and completing acceptance tests for transfers and streaming ([#354]). This unblocks further deployment and testing.
    *   **Tooling & Documentation:** The Supersim development environment was improved to allow modification of the `L2toL2CDM` predeploy ([#393]). A discussion on implementing CI SLAs was concluded with a decision not to proceed for now ([#16437]), and a broken documentation link was fixed ([#283]).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Performance Optimization:** A critical discussion began around `op-batcher` memory consumption ([#16537], [#16572]). Analysis identified the compressor as the primary source of memory usage during backlogs, with proposals to optimize the shadow compressor and discard the main compressor more eagerly after channel submission.
    *   **Flashblocks on OP Sepolia:** A new issue was created to track the non-public enablement of Flashblocks on `op-sepolia` ([#16496]), which is the next step after building confidence from the `eris-0` deployment.
    *   **Core Protocol Discussions:** Important conversations continued on core components. This includes strategies for the `op-supervisor` to handle fault proofs for pre-interop states ([#16166]) and improving its reset logic to validate L1 origins more effectively ([#16315]).
    *   **Persistent Bugs:** A user-facing issue regarding `eth_getTransactionCount` returning an incorrect nonce for pending transactions ([#623]) remains active, with community members seeking updates.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. The deep dive into `op-batcher` memory consumption ([#16537]) and `op-supervisor` fault proof logic ([#16166]) showcased active problem-solving among core developers. The community's role was visible through bug reports, such as the ongoing nonce issue ([#623]), and feature requests, like the well-received idea to enable event logging for user-specified contracts in Supersim ([#411]). Furthermore, knowledge sharing was apparent in discussions clarifying the distinct use cases for Supersim versus the Interop Kurtosis Devnet ([#399]), helping to align developers on the right tools for their work.
