# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Work in November focused on routine maintenance and advancing a key technical discussion. The project saw several automated code generation updates to ensure the codebase remains current. Concurrently, an important conversation continued around improving transaction management within the `op-batcher`, specifically concerning blob priority fee tracking. This discussion points toward potential enhancements for handling network congestion more effectively.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Development activity was centered on maintaining the health and consistency of the codebase.

- **Automated Code Generation:** Several pull requests were opened as part of routine maintenance to keep automatically generated code up-to-date. This ensures the registry's data and associated code remain synchronized. ([#1137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1137), [#1138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1138)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed during this period, with the focus remaining on an existing active issue.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed.
- **New & Active Issues:** While no new issues were created, a significant discussion progressed on active issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18102), which addresses blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr`. A proposal was made to implement a "decay" mechanism for the starting priority fee of new transactions. This approach, where the fee starts based on the previous transaction's fee rather than resetting to a minimum, is being considered as a way to improve transaction inclusion rates during periods of high network activity.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was observed through the ongoing technical discussion on issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18102). The comments and suggestions indicate focused engagement on improving core components like the `op-batcher`. Otherwise, the observed activity was primarily automated and routine in nature.
