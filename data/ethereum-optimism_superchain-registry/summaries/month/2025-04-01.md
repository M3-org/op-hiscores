# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Monthly Report (April 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
April was a month focused on planning and architectural improvement rather than active code changes. The primary activity centered on a proposal to enhance the maintainability of chain configurations within the Superchain registry. This discussion, captured in a new issue, aims to streamline how contract addresses are managed, preventing stale configurations and improving the overall accuracy of the registry. No new features or bug fixes were merged this month.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
There were no new features, bug fixes, or other code contributions merged during April 2025.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The project's issue tracker saw targeted activity around improving configuration management.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in April.
- **New & Active Issues:** A key discussion was initiated in issue [#978](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/978), which proposes a significant optimization for chain configuration. The suggestion is to reduce the number of addresses stored in `.toml` files to a minimal set. To improve maintainability, frequently changing contract and role addresses would instead be read from the `addresses.json` codegen file, ensuring configurations remain up-to-date and less prone to becoming stale.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community interaction this month was focused and strategic. The single new issue opened represents a forward-looking discussion on improving the core architecture of the registry. There was no significant pull request activity or high-volume discussion, indicating a period of planning over implementation.
