# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of significant maintenance and strategic updates for the Superchain Registry. Key efforts focused on expanding the registry with the re-addition of Celo mainnet and preparing for future protocol upgrades by adding the prestate for Upgrade 16 and new `op-contracts` versions. A major infrastructure shift was completed with the migration from Etherscan to Blockscout across the repository. Concurrently, the team resolved numerous long-standing issues related to sequencer stability, acceptance testing, and node supervision, enhancing the overall robustness of the Superchain's foundation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development work this month centered on keeping the registry up-to-date with the evolving Superchain ecosystem and improving its underlying tooling.

- **Superchain Registry Enhancements:** The registry saw several critical updates to reflect the latest protocol configurations and chain additions.
    - The absolute prestate for Upgrade 16 was added, ensuring the registry is prepared for the upcoming network upgrade ([#1084](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1084)).
    - Celo mainnet was re-integrated into the registry, with special handling for its unique genesis history as a former L1 fork ([#1086](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1086)).
    - Standard version entries for `op-contracts/v4.0.0` were added for both mainnet and Sepolia, aligning the registry with the latest contract deployments ([#1088](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1088)).
    - A minor bug fix corrected a comment error in standard configuration files ([#1089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1089)).

- **Infrastructure Migration to Blockscout:** In a significant repository-wide effort, all dependencies and references to Etherscan were migrated to Blockscout. This change impacts configuration files, documentation, and operational scripts, standardizing the project's block explorer tooling ([#1085](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1085)).

- **New Chain Proposal:** Towards the end of the month, a pull request was opened to add the "Silent Data mainnet chain" to the registry, signaling continued growth of the Superchain ecosystem ([#1091](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1091)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in July focused on resolving stability problems, improving test infrastructure, and discussing future protocol enhancements.

- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were closed, indicating progress in hardening the system and cleaning up the backlog.
    - **Sequencer & Node Stability:** Several critical issues concerning sequencer stability, including recovery from window expiration ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/11228)) and halting on temporary errors ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/12240)), were resolved. An issue for improving `op-supervisor` and `op-node` reset targets was also closed as recent changes made it obsolete ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16314)).
    - **Acceptance Testing:** Progress was made in testing, with the closure of an issue to update the flashblocks acceptance test gate ([#16630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16630)) and another related to test failures from an `op-geth` version bump ([#16731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16731)).
    - **Flashblocks:** Issues related to enabling flashblocks on op-sepolia and with reth were closed in favor of creating a milestone or new, more focused issues ([#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16496), [#16544](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16544)).

- **New & Active Issues:** Discussions this month highlighted areas for future work and improvement.
    - A new issue was opened to address discrepancies between the acceptance test topology and production environments, aiming to improve test fidelity ([#16746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16746)).
    - Active discussions continued on tracking the "Min Base Fee" ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16807)) and designing a system for congestion-based builder transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/306)), pointing to ongoing research into future protocol improvements.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active issue discussions throughout the month. Team members were actively engaged in resolving technical challenges and planning future work, as seen in the detailed discussions around `op-node` logic, supervisor improvements, and the Blockscout migration. The month also saw a positive sign of external collaboration, with a community member expressing interest in contributing to the design document for congestion-based transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/306)). The submission of a new chain to the registry ([#1091](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1091)) further demonstrates the project's role as a central hub for the growing Superchain community.
