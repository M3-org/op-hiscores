# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
August was a month of steady progress, focusing on expanding the Superchain ecosystem, advancing key protocol features, and refining testing infrastructure. The registry grew with the addition of the Arena Z testnet, and integrations for Sova Sepolia and Celo-sepolia were initiated. Significant discussion and cross-repository coordination continued for the "Min Base Fee" feature, a key technical priority. Concurrently, the team closed out major testing initiatives for the proofs system and cleaned up legacy components, improving the overall health and stability of the development environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on registry expansion and routine maintenance to keep the project's data current.

- **Superchain Registry Expansion:** The registry was expanded with the addition of the Arena Z testnet, including its configuration and genesis data, providing a new environment for the ecosystem ([#1092](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1092)).
- **Codegen Maintenance:** Codegen results were updated to synchronize `chainList.json`, `chainList.toml`, and address files with the latest on-chain data, ensuring the registry remains accurate ([#1098](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1098)).

Additionally, several pull requests were opened to further expand the registry, including adding the Sova Sepolia Testnet ([#1094](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1094)), integrating Celo-sepolia ([#1099](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1099)), and updating an address for Celo ([#1095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1095)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in August focused on resolving long-standing testing tasks, addressing CI/CD pipeline gaps, and progressing discussions on major new features.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Testing & Infrastructure:** A significant effort in acceptance testing was concluded with the closure of issues for the proofs system ([#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15946)) and `op-challenger` on interop chains ([#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/15948)). The team also cleaned up the event system ([#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17001)) and re-evaluated test setup logic ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/375)).
    - **Sequencer Enhancements:** A key operational improvement was completed by enabling flashblocks on all Sunnyside sequencers for Sepolia, with successful failover testing ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16688)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **"Min Base Fee" Feature:** This feature saw continued discussion across multiple issues ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16807), [#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/742)). Work is being coordinated across several repositories, including `reth`, `op-alloy`, and `optimism`, with early drafts shared for review. A related discussion on estimating state growth was initiated and moved to a dedicated design document.
    - **CI/CD & Testing:** A new issue was opened to explore running the monorepo CI suite on `op-geth` PRs to improve end-to-end testing ([#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/665)). Another issue regarding missing test logs in `op-acceptance-tests` was opened, investigated, and resolved ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17151)).
    - **Documentation & Maintenance:** A significant documentation overhaul for deploying OP Stack Rollup testnets is in progress to address community confusion ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1530)). A new task was created to migrate legacy FP recovery tasks to a new framework ([#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1162)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the cross-repository coordination for the "Min Base Fee" feature, with wlawt sharing progress from `reth` and `op-alloy` to facilitate early review. Community engagement was highlighted by OBlackmon3 seeking guidance on contributing a fix for an RPC issue ([#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/389)).

Maintainers provided clear guidance on project direction, as seen when @pcw109550 informed a contributor that their PR might not be merged due to a strategic shift away from the event system, while still acknowledging the value of their work ([#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16874)). Proactive contribution was also visible, with @blmalone offering to assist with a newly created task for migrating FP recovery tasks ([#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/1162)). These interactions reflect a healthy and communicative development environment.
