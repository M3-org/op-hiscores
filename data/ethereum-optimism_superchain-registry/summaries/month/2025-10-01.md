# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of targeted maintenance, operational hardening, and deep technical investigation. Development focused on resolving a series of issues related to the Flashblocks system, improving CI/CD processes, and performing routine updates to contract versions. Significant effort was also dedicated to diagnosing a critical Go compatibility issue affecting Cannon and debating the best approach for handling out-of-sync nodes in `op-dispute-mon`. While no major new features were shipped, the work this month strengthened the stability of existing systems and laid the groundwork for resolving key technical challenges.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on registry maintenance and improving the developer workflow.

- **Standard Version Updates:** The registry was updated to include the standard version `op-contracts/v4.1.0` for both Sepolia and Mainnet, standardizing configurations that were previously release candidates ([#1109](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1109)). A separate pull request was opened to update the `CHAINS.md` documentation file ([#1108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1108)).

- **CI/CD Enhancements:** To aid in debugging, the CI pipeline was improved to provide more detailed error messages when duplicate chain names or IDs are detected in the registry ([#1118](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1118)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on closing out operational problems and discussing complex, ongoing challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks System Hardening:** A cluster of issues related to Flashblocks was resolved. This included closing an issue for refining alerts and runbooks ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17423)), fixing a connectivity problem in the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` that caused lost blocks ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17856)), and completing coordination with RPC providers to upgrade to the new Flashblocks RPC node ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17857)).
    - **Scope & Priority Changes:** An issue to refactor the `op-node` CLI was closed as "not planned" after a proposed PR was not supported ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16680)). An older issue for adding negative testing to chain configurations was also closed, as the project has moved from a validation-based to a report-based approach ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/686)).
    - **Test Completion:** The Fusaka activation test for L1 was closed, marking its completion ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17500)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility:** A significant issue ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17060)) is under investigation where Go 1.25 causes incorrect Keccak hashes and other crypto function failures in Cannon. A detailed diagnosis is available, but the problem persists as the Go 1.25.1 patch does not appear to include the required MIPS fix.
    - **`op-dispute-mon` Sync Handling:** Discussion continued in [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17814) on how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes. The conversation explored using the `syncStatus` to determine the expected L2 head and ignoring results from nodes that are behind, while also considering the risk of a node following an incorrect fork.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
While no new contributors were explicitly mentioned, collaboration was evident in the active technical discussions on key issues. The detailed back-and-forth on `op-dispute-mon`'s sync logic ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17814)) and the diagnostic efforts on the Cannon Go compatibility bug ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17060)) highlight the team's focus on collaborative problem-solving for complex, low-level challenges. Furthermore, the resolution of the Flashblocks provider upgrade ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17857)) indicates successful coordination with external ecosystem partners.
