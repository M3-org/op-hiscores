# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of targeted improvements and operational hardening for the Superchain Registry. Development focused on resolving critical flashblock propagation issues, enhancing CI/CD for better developer feedback, and updating registry standards. While no major new features were shipped, significant progress was made in stabilizing existing systems. Key ongoing discussions centered on complex technical challenges, including a Go compatibility issue affecting Cannon and the proper handling of out-of-sync nodes in the dispute monitor, signaling a focus on long-term protocol resilience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on registry maintenance and improving the development pipeline.

- **Registry Content Updates:** The registry was updated to include the standard version for `op-contracts/v4.1.0` for both Sepolia and Mainnet, standardizing configurations that were previously release candidates ([#1109](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1109)). A separate pull request was opened to update the `CHAINS.md` documentation file ([#1108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1108)).

- **CI/CD Enhancements:** To improve the developer experience and speed up debugging, CI error messages for duplicate chain names and IDs were enhanced to provide more detailed and actionable information ([#1118](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1118)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on resolving production bugs and clarifying the status of older or ongoing technical challenges. No new issues were opened in the reporting period.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblock Stability:** A series of issues related to flashblocks were resolved. One fix addressed blocks being lost due to connectivity issues and subscriber timeouts in the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17856)). A related effort saw the successful coordination with RPC providers to upgrade to the new Flashblocks RPC node ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17857)), and an earlier issue for refining flashblock alerts was closed in favor of work done in another repository ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17423)).
    - **Strategic Deprecation & Completion:** An issue to add negative testing for chain configurations was closed as the project has moved from a validation-based to a report-based approach, making the original goal less relevant ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/686)). An exploratory issue on refactoring the `op-node` architecture was closed as "not planned" after a proposed PR was not supported ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16680)). The Fusaka activation test for L1 was also closed ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17500)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Cannon Go Compatibility:** A significant discussion continued around issue [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17060), which details how Go 1.25 compatibility problems are causing incorrect Keccak hashes in Cannon. The problem is linked to a known Go issue, and the latest Go release (1.25.1) does not appear to contain the necessary MIPS fix, representing a potential blocker.
    - **Dispute Monitor Sync Handling:** Active discussion on issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17814) focused on improving how `op-dispute-mon` handles out-of-sync nodes. The conversation explored using the `syncStatus` to determine the expected L2 head and ignoring results from nodes that are behind, while also noting the risk of trusting a node that may have followed an incorrect fork.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
While the daily reports did not highlight new contributors, they showed strong collaboration among the core team on complex technical problems. The active discussions on the Cannon Go compatibility issue ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17060)) and the `op-dispute-mon` logic ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17814)) demonstrate a deep engagement with protocol-level challenges. Furthermore, the resolution of the flashblocks issue ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17857)) explicitly mentioned coordination with external Flashblocks RPC providers, indicating effective collaboration across the ecosystem.
