# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's activity focused on registry maintenance, standards updates, and strategic issue resolution. The primary technical achievement was the addition of the `op-contracts/v4.1.0` standard version for Mainnet and Sepolia, ensuring the registry stays current with contract deployments. The project also made key decisions on its technical direction, closing an `op-node` architecture proposal as "not planned" and shifting from a validation-based to a report-based testing strategy. A significant ongoing challenge is a compatibility issue between Cannon and Go 1.25, which is causing incorrect cryptographic hashes and is being actively investigated.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on updating standards and documentation within the registry.

- **Standard Version Updates:** The registry was updated to include the `op-contracts/v4.1.0` standard for both Sepolia and Mainnet, mirroring the `v4.1.0-rc.3` configurations. This ensures the registry accurately reflects the latest contract versions ([#1109](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1109)).
- **Documentation:** A pull request was opened to update the `CHAINS.md` file, reflecting ongoing maintenance of project documentation ([#1108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1108)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month involved closing out legacy tasks, making strategic decisions, and identifying a critical compatibility bug.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Architectural & Strategic Decisions:** An issue to refactor the `op-node` service ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/16680)) was closed as "not planned" after its proposed implementation was not supported. Similarly, an older issue regarding negative testing for chain configurations ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/686)) was closed, as the project has pivoted from a validation-based to a report-based approach.
    - **Completed Tasks:** The Fusaka activation test for L1 ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17500)) was closed, indicating its completion. An issue for refining flashblock alerts ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17423)) was also closed, with the work having been completed in the `k8s` repository.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Potential Blocker:** A significant issue ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17060)) regarding Go 1.25 compatibility with Cannon is under active discussion. The problem causes incorrect Keccak hashes and potentially affects other crypto functions. A detailed diagnosis has been documented, but the required MIPS fix was not included in the Go 1.25.1 release, leaving the issue unresolved.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident through cross-repository coordination. The closure of the flashblock alert issue ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17423)) highlighted the connection between the `superchain-registry` and `k8s` repositories. Additionally, active discussion and detailed diagnostic work on the Cannon compatibility issue ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17060)) demonstrate focused problem-solving within the community.
