# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
Work in September focused on foundational maintenance and planning for significant future updates. The CI pipeline was streamlined to improve reliability by removing a problematic integration. Discussions progressed on the necessary changes to support Kona + Cannon, specifically within OPCM and `op-dispute-mon`, laying the groundwork for future integration. Additionally, a pull request was opened to update contract addresses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development activity centered on improving the stability of the development process and preparing for contract updates.

- **CI Pipeline Reliability:** The Codecov integration was removed from the CI pipeline to resolve build failures and enhance overall stability ([#1101](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1101)).
- **Contract Address Updates:** A pull request was opened to update contract addresses for u16, which is now awaiting review ([#1100](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1100)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were opened or closed during this period. The primary focus was on advancing discussions around existing high-priority issues.

- **New & Active Issues:** Discussions centered on the upcoming integration of Kona + Cannon.
    - In [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17285), contributors clarified that OPCM will require modifications to `OPContractsManager.sol` to support deploying the new game type.
    - Similarly, in [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/17286), the scope was refined to ensure `op-dispute-mon` is updated to explicitly support cannon-kona games and return errors for any unsupported game types.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active technical discussions surrounding future development. Contributors `ajsutton` and `pauldowman` engaged in detailed planning on the Kona + Cannon support issues, clarifying technical requirements and defining the path forward for implementation in both OPCM and `op-dispute-mon`.
