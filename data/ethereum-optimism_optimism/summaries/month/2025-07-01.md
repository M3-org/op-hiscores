# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month dedicated to planning and foundational work, with a strong emphasis on enhancing the OP Stack's testing infrastructure and preparing for major feature rollouts. While no major features were completed, significant progress was made in designing and initiating work on flashblocks deployment, a configurable minimum base fee, and substantial improvements to the `op-sync-tester`. This period of focused preparation sets the stage for upcoming releases aimed at increasing network robustness, improving developer experience, and advancing protocol capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While the daily reports indicated no major completed features, development activity was evident through numerous new pull requests initiating work across testing, protocol configuration, and component refactoring.

*   **Testing Infrastructure Enhancements:** A significant effort was made to bolster the project's testing capabilities. This included introducing Supervisor Fuzzing to improve component robustness ([#16791](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16791)), adding more `sysgo` tests to `op-acceptance-tests` ([#16817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16817)), and porting Fjord/Holocene acceptance tests to the devstack ([#16920](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16920)). Work was also done to improve code clarity by renaming test contract harnesses ([#16781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16781), [#16782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16782)).

*   **Protocol & Configuration Work-in-Progress:** Several pull requests laid the groundwork for future protocol adjustments. A key feature was initiated to allow for configurable minimum base fees ([#16852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16852)). Other foundational work included a fix for `superchainConfig` upgrades ([#16838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16838)), a simplification of the `OpChainConfig` struct ([#16798](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16798)), and initial work on execution multiplexing for `op-node` and `op-devstack` ([#16873](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16873)).

*   **Component Improvements & Maintenance:** Smaller-scale improvements were initiated, such as addressing a visibility issue with the `NextFrame` method in `op-batcher` ([#16830](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16830)). Routine dependency updates were also managed, including bumps for `urfave/cli` ([#16924](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16924)) and `prometheus/client_golang` ([#16928](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16928)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were reported as closed in July, but the month saw a flurry of new issues that outline the project's near-term roadmap and priorities.

*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during the reporting period.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Flashblocks Deployment & Monitoring:** A major focus was on preparing for flashblocks. New issues were created to plan the production mainnet deployment ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16759]) and conduct devnet load testing ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16756)). Extensive discussion in [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16388) detailed requirements for monitoring and alerting, covering peer counts, block progression SLAs, and connection errors. This led to new issues for specific alerts, such as detecting when a non-flashblocks sequencer is active ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16867]) or when peer counts are low ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16868)).
    *   **`op-sync-tester` Expansion:** The capabilities of the `op-sync-tester` were a key area of planning. New issues propose adding support for the `engine` namespace to validate payloads ([#16701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16701]), integrating `sysgo` for easier configuration ([#16702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16702]), and adding a `sync` namespace for session management ([#16778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16778)). An active discussion in [#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16703) outlined future test cases, including validation of all OP Stack hard fork transitions.
    *   **Protocol Design & Tracking:** The "Min Base Fee" feature moved into the planning phase with a new tracking issue ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16807]) and a corresponding issue detailing the required changes to the `SystemConfig` contract ([#16839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16839)). Tracking issues were also created for the `op-batcher` rollout ([#16843](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16843)) and the Geth v1.16.1 merge ([#16825](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16825)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration in July was characterized by intensive planning and design discussions within GitHub issues, laying the groundwork for future implementation. While there was limited back-and-forth on pull requests, the detailed conversations in issues demonstrate strong internal alignment and community input.

The detailed breakdown of monitoring requirements for flashblocks in [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16388) and the outlining of test cases for the sync tester in [#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16703) highlight a collaborative approach to feature specification. Similarly, the discussion around event tracing in `op-service` ([#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16874)) showed multiple team members weighing in to align on the best path forward, ultimately deciding to leverage existing work and potentially deprecate the system in question. This pattern of using issues as a forum for detailed planning was the dominant collaborative dynamic of the month.
