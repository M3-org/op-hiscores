# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (November 2024)

## üöÄ Highlights
Based on the available data for November, development activity focused on identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks within the protocol's components. While no new code was merged, a key issue was raised concerning the `op-challenger`'s interaction with the L1 node. This points to an ongoing effort to optimize the efficiency and reduce the operational load of the fault-proof system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, there were no completed code changes, new features, or bug fixes merged during this period.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The primary focus in issue tracking this month was on performance optimization.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed in November.

- **New & Active Issues:** A significant new issue was opened to improve the performance of the `op-challenger`.
    - **`op-challenger` Performance:** Issue [#13090](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13090) was created to address the high frequency of calls the `op-challenger` makes to the L1 node. The component currently processes all games from the last 28 days, leading to excessive load. The proposal suggests adding an option to limit how often games are processed to mitigate this.
