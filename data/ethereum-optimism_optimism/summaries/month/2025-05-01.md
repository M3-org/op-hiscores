# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (May 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
May was a month of foundational planning and strategic groundwork for the Optimism protocol. Development activity focused on initiating key refactoring efforts and organizing future workstreams rather than shipping new features. Significant new initiatives were kicked off to enhance the Fault Proof system, improve the L2 test suite structure, and formally track the upcoming Interop proofs upgrade. This period reflects a deliberate focus on improving code quality, maintainability, and preparing for major future protocol enhancements related to security and the Superchain.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no major features were completed and merged in May, several important pull requests were opened, signaling the start of new development cycles.

- **Supervisor Enhancements**: Work began on refining the `op-supervisor` with the introduction of a `dependencySet` API in PR [#16156]. This effort aims to improve how dependencies are managed within this critical component.
- **Test Suite Refactoring**: To improve code quality and maintainability, a pull request ([#15862](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/15862)) was opened to begin the cleanup, restructuring, and documentation of the L2 test suite.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in May centered on organizing complex projects and defining the scope for future protocol upgrades.

- **Closed Issues:** The primary action was organizational. The issue for implementing the "New Creator Pattern" ([#13168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13168)) was closed, as all related sub-tasks were consolidated under the main parent issue ([#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421)) for more streamlined tracking.

- **New & Active Issues:** Two significant issues were opened, outlining major areas of future work:
    - **Fault Proof System:** A new issue ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15789)) was created to investigate and implement necessary OPCM (Optimism Protocol Compatibility Module) changes for the Fault Proof creator contract. This is a critical task for ensuring protocol compatibility and security.
    - **Interoperability Planning:** To formalize a key Superchain initiative, a new tracking issue ([#15980](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15980)) was established for the "Interop proofs U17 proof upgrade" workstream.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month appeared focused and strategic, centered on planning and project organization. The consolidation of the Creator Pattern issues into a single parent tracker demonstrates a commitment to improving project management clarity for contributors. Furthermore, the detailed planning checklist noted in the comments for the Fault Proof OPCM issue ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15789)) highlights the thorough and coordinated approach being taken for significant protocol upgrades. The activity suggests that core development teams are laying the groundwork for larger, more complex initiatives.
