# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
November began with a strong focus on enhancing the stability and reliability of the Optimism stack. Development efforts centered on maintenance and bug fixes rather than new feature releases. Key achievements include improving the observability of the dispute monitor with new error metrics, resolving a critical bug in the contract upgrade process, and a concerted effort to harden the `op-acceptance-tests` suite by fixing bugs and addressing test flakiness.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month concentrated on bug fixes, testing improvements, and monitoring enhancements to ensure protocol robustness.

- **Testing Suite Stability:** A significant effort was made to improve the `op-acceptance-tests`. A bug affecting operator fee calculations when running tests against `isthmus` networks was resolved ([#18104](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18104)). Additionally, new pull requests were opened to proactively address test flakiness and improve reliability ([#18106](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18106), [#18107](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18107)).

- **Protocol Enhancements and Bug Fixes:**
    - **Dispute Monitoring:** The `op-dispute-mon` was enhanced with new Prometheus metrics to track node endpoint errors, providing better visibility into RPC failures during the update cycle ([#17622](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17622)).
    - **Contract Management:** A bug in the `opcm.upgrade` process was fixed to ensure the `CANNON_KONA` initial bond is correctly set during contract upgrades ([#18100](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18100)).
    - **Code Refinement:** A minor cleanup was proposed to remove a redundant path join in the `update-op-geth` helper script ([#18108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18108)).
