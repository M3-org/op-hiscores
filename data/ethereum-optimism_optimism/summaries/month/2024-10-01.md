# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (October 2024)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development efforts centered on improving the scalability and efficiency of the Superchain's upgrade process. A critical need was identified to refactor fault proof contracts to support `Creator` contracts, addressing a significant bottleneck caused by high gas costs during deployment. This strategic focus aims to reduce the friction of onboarding new L2 chains and streamline future upgrades across the ecosystem, laying the groundwork for more efficient scaling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no major features were merged this month based on the provided data, significant planning and design work took place to address architectural challenges.

The primary focus was on the design for refactoring dispute game contracts. The current implementation requires a full redeployment for each new L2 chain due to immutable constructor arguments, costing 3-5 million gas per deployment. This creates a bottleneck, limiting the number of chains that can be upgraded in a single transaction. An updated design document ([design-docs/pull/275](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/275)) reflects the latest direction for this refactoring effort, which aims to remove these immutables and allow for shared contract implementations across chains.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month highlighted a key area for future development focused on protocol efficiency and scalability.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed in the provided data.

- **New & Active Issues:** The most significant activity revolved around issue **[#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421)**, which was opened to track the refactoring of fault proof contracts. Discussion on this issue emphasized its importance for the Superchain's upgrade process. The high deployment cost of the current contracts is a major impediment to scaling. This issue, previously paused, has been re-prioritized as it represents a critical path for improving the efficiency of managing a growing number of chains within the Superchain.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was characterized by strategic planning and technical design discussions. The activity around issue [#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421) and its associated design document update indicates a focused effort by the team to address foundational architectural challenges necessary for the long-term health and scalability of the Superchain.
