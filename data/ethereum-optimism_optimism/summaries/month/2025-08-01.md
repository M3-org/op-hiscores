# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights

August was a month of significant groundwork and infrastructure enhancement, focusing on bolstering the OP Stack's long-term stability, testability, and developer experience. Major strides were made in overhauling the testing framework, with extensive refactoring of `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` to improve reliability and expand capabilities. The fault proof system continued to evolve with the introduction of `FaultDisputeGameV2` and substantial planning for the "Kona + Cannon" upgrade. Concurrently, the team advanced the public rollout of Flashblocks, improved developer tooling like `op-up` and `op-deployer`, and executed a major codebase simplification by systematically removing the legacy event system from `op-node`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments

This section details the concrete work completed and merged in August.

### Testing Infrastructure & Reliability

A primary focus this month was on making the testing suite more robust, reliable, and comprehensive.

*   **Sync Tester Overhaul:** The `op-sync-tester` underwent a major refactor to implement the `L2ELNode` interface, simplifying network setup for testing ([#17200]). It was enhanced with Verifier Engine APIs for numerous hardforks, including Isthmus, Ecotone, and Granite ([#17072]), and integrated into `op-devstack` for E2E testing ([#17132]).
*   **Acceptance Test Enhancements:** `op-acceptance-tests` saw the migration of legacy tests to the new `op-devstack` framework ([#17130]), the addition of a flaky test report generator ([#17250]), and fixes for test flakiness during initialization ([#17103]) and fork activation ([#17270]).
*   **Devnet Stability:** A critical bug causing connection errors in `op-devstack` was resolved by explicitly setting IPv4 binding ([#17114]). Flashblocks support was also added to the Kurtosis devnet, enabling more realistic testing environments ([#17172]).
*   **CI Optimization:** The CI pipeline was improved by reducing `go-tests` timeouts ([#17126]) and ensuring tests run only on relevant changes ([#17105]).

### Fault Proof System & Cannon Enhancements

Work continued on advancing the dispute game and optimizing the Cannon fault proof VM.

*   **Dispute Game V2:** A new version of the fault dispute game, `FaultDisputeGameV2`, was introduced to validate the creator pattern flow, a foundational step for future dispute resolution mechanisms ([#16929]).
*   **Cannon Performance:** Cannon's performance and monitoring were improved by adding i-cache miss metrics ([#17123]), reducing logging frequency for long-running proofs ([#17186]), and optimizing its heap/code cache size to allow more parallel instances on a single machine ([#17246]).
*   **Challenger Improvements:** The `op-challenger` gained an option to restrict the frequency of its update cycles, reducing calls to L1 nodes ([#17233]).

### Code Refactoring & Core Protocol Updates

Significant effort was dedicated to simplifying the codebase and updating core dependencies.

*   **Event System Removal:** A systematic effort was made to remove the legacy event system from `op-node` and other components, simplifying the codebase and improving maintainability. This included the removal of `ForceResetEvent` ([#17061]), `CrossUpdateRequestEvent` ([#17101]), `PromoteSafeEvent`, and `PromoteFinalizedEvent` ([#17161], [#17122], [#17165]).
*   **Dependency Upgrades:** The `op-geth` dependency was updated to include upstream Geth v1.16.1 changes ([#16785]), and Cannon deployment was updated to support Go 1.24 ([#17155]).
*   **Bug Fixes:** Critical bugs were fixed in `op-program` to prevent resource leaks ([#17166]) and in `op-service/eth` to ensure correct execution payload creation ([#17154]).

### Developer Tooling & Experience

Improvements were made to tools used by developers building on and with the OP Stack.

*   **`op-deployer` Forge Integration:** Work began on migrating `op-deployer` to use Forge, with the integration of a Forge CLI wrapper ([#17231], [#17242]) and forge autodiscovery capabilities ([#17152]).
*   **`op-up` Enhancements:** The new `op-up` local development tool received several UX improvements, including an ASCII art welcome message ([#17205]), a survey link on shutdown ([#17206]), and basic CLI argument handling ([#17208]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues

Several key initiatives and long-standing issues were resolved in August:

*   **Flashblocks Rollout:** Multiple issues related to the public enablement of Flashblocks were closed, covering Go-To-Market coordination ([#17027]), documentation review ([#17141]), and sequencer enablement ([#16688]).
*   **Testing Milestones:** Major testing-related issues were completed, including the implementation of `op-challenger` acceptance tests on interop ([#15948]), support for the `eth` namespace in `op-sync-tester` ([#16700]), and the initial release of the `op-up` tool ([#17003]).
*   **Core Protocol & Cleanup:** The Geth v1.16.1 merge was completed ([#16825]), the `min-base-fee` failure modes analysis was finalized ([#311]), and the effort to remove two events from the event system was concluded ([#17001]).

### New & Active Issues

New issues opened this month outline the roadmap for the next phase of development, focusing on fault proofs and developer tooling.

*   **Forge Deployer Migration:** A comprehensive set of issues ([#17213] - [#17218]) was created to track the migration of `op-deployer` to use Forge. This represents a significant strategic shift to standardize deployment tooling.
*   **Kona + Cannon Upgrade:** A large batch of issues ([#17237], [#17282], etc.) was opened to plan the integration of Kona + Cannon as a fallback fault proof system, detailing work needed in `op-challenger`, `vm-runner`, and other tooling.
*   **Dispute Game V2 Roadmap:** A detailed plan for developing and integrating version 2 of the FaultDisputeGame and PermissionedDisputeGame was laid out in a series of new issues ([#17254] - [#17263]).
*   **Architectural Discussions:** An ongoing discussion on deprecating the request-response P2P sync in `op-node` ([#14108]) in favor of a simpler, more robust unsafe block sync mechanism highlights a key architectural consideration for future scalability.
*   **User Pain Points:** The recurring `op-proposer` transaction failure issue ([#13502]) continues to see activity, indicating a persistent user configuration challenge that may require better documentation or tooling.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration

August saw strong collaborative energy, particularly around major upcoming initiatives. The planned migration of `op-deployer` to Forge sparked immediate interest, with contributor `tooshiNoko` proactively offering to lead the effort across multiple tracking issues ([#17213], [#17214]), demonstrating healthy community engagement and ownership.

Discussions around improving the CI/CD pipeline ([#686], [#17184]) and local development experience showed active collaboration between team members to reduce friction for all contributors. The multi-faceted Flashblocks rollout required tight coordination between engineering, documentation, and external RaaS providers, showcasing effective cross-functional teamwork to deliver a major feature. Finally, long-standing issues like the missing RPC content type header ([#389]) continued to draw community attention, with users offering to help diagnose and fix the problem.
