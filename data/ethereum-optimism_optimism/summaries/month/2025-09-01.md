# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September was a month of significant consolidation and preparation for future protocol upgrades. Development efforts were heavily concentrated on overhauling the testing infrastructure, with a major push to migrate acceptance tests to Devstack, unify them into a single workflow, and enhance the `op-sync-tester`. This focus on robustness was complemented by the closure of numerous long-standing issues related to Drippie, Cannon, and proof systems, clearing the path for new initiatives. Concurrently, foundational work for the next generation of fault proofs began, with active development to support Kona + Cannon game types and initial design discussions for an aggregate dispute game.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on enhancing testability, improving configuration, and laying the groundwork for future protocol features.

- **Testing and CI/CD Overhaul:** A major effort was undertaken to improve the project's testing framework and CI/CD pipelines.
    - Acceptance tests were systematically ported to Devstack, including Fjord (Holocene) tests and critical smoke tests ([#16920](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16920), [#17300](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17300)).
    - All acceptance tests were consolidated into a single, unified workflow to improve efficiency and organization ([#16755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16755), [#16817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16817)).
    - The `op-sync-tester` was enhanced with support for the sync namespace ([#17299](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17299)) and integrated with an external Execution Layer to improve testing against various network configurations ([#17251](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17251)).
    - The `publish-cannon-prestates` CI job was migrated to CircleCI to improve reliability ([#17296](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17296)).

- **Protocol and Configuration Improvements:** Several changes were made to improve the flexibility and control of the OP Stack.
    - The `SystemConfig` contract was updated to support feature flagging, enabling features to be toggled by the ProxyAdmin ([#17281](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17281)).
    - The `op-deployer` was enhanced with a configurable `GasLimit` field, allowing for custom gas limits in chain intent files ([#17271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17271)).
    - The `op-challenger` received configurable delay parameters for game responses, allowing for more flexible fault proof testing ([#16988](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16988)).
    - The `op-geth` dependency was updated to `v1.16.2` ([#17228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17228)).

- **Development Workflow Streamlining:** To accelerate development, the frozen file check was removed from the CI/CD pipeline, allowing the `develop` branch to progress more rapidly ([#17289](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17289)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The month saw the resolution of a significant backlog of major initiatives, while new issues focused on bug fixes and the design of next-generation features.

- **Closed Issues:** A notable number of long-standing and high-impact issues were closed, marking the completion of major project milestones.
    - **Proof Systems & Governance:** The shipping checklist for Stage 1.4 was completed, and details for interop proofs for governance were finalized ([#15827](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15827), [#15968](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15968)).
    - **Drippie Integration:** Several issues related to the deployment and integration of Drippie for managing challenger hot wallet funds were closed, including mainnet deployment and the setup of dashboards and alerting ([#12876](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12876), [#13764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13764), [#14048](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14048)).
    - **Cannon Enhancements:** Key issues for adding full `mips64r2` ISA support and scaling the Cannon VM runner were resolved ([#13969](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13969), [#16910](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16910)).
    - **Testing & Deployment:** The initiative to unify acceptance tests into a single workflow was completed ([#16272](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16272)).

- **New & Active Issues:** Discussions centered on bug fixes, compatibility for new fault proof systems, and future protocol design.
    - **`op-node` Gossip Bug:** A critical bug was identified where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values, causing panics. Active discussion is underway to determine the best fix, weighing a direct patch against a more robust `DefaultP2PConfig` method ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17308)).
    - **Kona + Cannon Support:** A key area of active development is ensuring stack-wide compatibility for the new Kona + Cannon game types. This involves work on `op-dispute-mon` ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17286)), `OPContractsManager` ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17285)), and standard prestates ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17283)).
    - **Future Dispute Game Design:** A new issue was opened to begin the design phase for an "aggregate dispute game," signaling the start of research into multi-proof fault proof systems ([#17305](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17305)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development activity this month reflects a highly collaborative environment focused on improving system stability and developer experience. The detailed technical discussion on the `op-node/p2p/gossip` bug ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17308)) showcases a healthy process of debate and solution design among core contributors. The concerted effort to unify acceptance tests and improve CI configuration ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17184)) indicates a strong team focus on reducing friction in the development lifecycle. Finally, the closure of numerous high-impact, long-running issues suggests a successful, coordinated push to finalize major initiatives and clear the way for the next phase of protocol development.
