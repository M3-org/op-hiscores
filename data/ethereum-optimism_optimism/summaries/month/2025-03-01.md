# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (March 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
Development in March focused on forward-looking planning and improving the developer toolchain. While no new features were merged, significant groundwork was laid for future enhancements. Key activities included initiating proactive compatibility updates for the Cannon proving system to support Go 1.24. Additionally, efforts began to streamline the developer experience by identifying and planning to reduce friction in the Go and Solidity development workflow.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, there were no completed pull requests or major code changes merged during this period. The focus remained on identifying and scoping future work.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The month's activity centered on opening new issues to track upcoming technical initiatives and developer experience improvements.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed in March.

- **New & Active Issues:** Two key issues were opened, highlighting a focus on toolchain maintenance and developer workflow.
    - **Cannon Toolchain Updates:** To ensure the Cannon proving system remains compatible with the latest toolchains, an issue was opened to track the work needed to support Go 1.24 [#14760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14760). This is a proactive measure to maintain system health and security.
    - **Developer Experience Improvements:** The EVM Safety team opened an issue to address friction for developers working across Go and Solidity [#14976](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14976). The proposal aims to automate the updating of Go structs when Solidity contracts change, improving efficiency and reducing potential errors.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was centered on internal planning and problem identification rather than code review. The EVM Safety team's initiative to improve the Go/Solidity workflow [#14976](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14976) demonstrates cross-functional efforts to enhance the developer experience within the project. The reported activity did not show significant public discussion or contributions on issues or pull requests.
