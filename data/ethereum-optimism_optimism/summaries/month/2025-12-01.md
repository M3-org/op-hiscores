# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Development in December kicked off with a strong focus on advancing the OP Stack's capabilities, particularly through significant progress in integrating Optimistic ZK games. The `op-challenger` was heavily refactored to support these new game types, enabling challenging, resolution, and bond reclamation. Concurrently, the team addressed critical stability issues in core components, shipping important bug fixes for `op-node` and `op-batcher` to improve network reliability. Foundational work also continued on contract management with `OPContractsManagerV2` and the formal introduction of the Custom Gas Token system, alongside continuous improvements to CI/CD pipelines and developer tooling.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on enhancing protocol capabilities, improving stability, and refining developer infrastructure.

- **Optimistic ZK Game Integration:** A major effort was dedicated to preparing the stack for ZK-based fault proofs.
    - The `op-challenger` was substantially enhanced to support ZK games by refactoring `GameType` into a more generic package ([#18432](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18432)), replacing `TraceType` ([#18433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18433)), and introducing a generic `Player` implementation to reduce boilerplate ([#18441](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18441)).
    - Core functionalities were implemented, allowing the challenger to challenge unsafe ZK game proposals ([#18467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18467)), resolve games ([#18464](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18464)), and reclaim bonds ([#18465](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18465)).

- **Core Protocol Stability and Bug Fixes:** Several critical bugs were addressed to enhance the robustness of the network.
    - A recurring bug in `op-batcher` affecting `MaxChannelDuration` tracking for large backlogs was fixed ([#18344](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18344), [#18327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18327)).
    - `op-node` stability was improved by fixing an issue where the L1 origin selector could get stuck during reorgs ([#18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)).
    - Blob fetching logic in `op-service` was updated to correctly handle duplicate blob hashes ([#18492](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18492)).

- **Contract Management and Security:** The smart contract framework saw significant refactoring and security hardening.
    - `OPContractsManagerV2` (OPCMv2) was made more modular by breaking out utilities into a helper contract, reducing its overall size ([#18454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18454)).
    - New tests were added for OPCMv2's deployment logic and core behaviors ([#18486](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18486), [#18389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18389)).
    - Contract security standards were raised by enforcing strict pragma usage ([#18390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18390)).

- **New Features & Enhancements:**
    - The Custom Gas Token (CGT) system was formally integrated as a system feature, removing the previous developer flag ([#18405](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18405)).
    - A new script was added to deploy SaferSafes, improving multisig deployment tooling ([#18448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18448)).
    - `op-conductor` now includes first-class support for Kona health probes, enhancing monitoring capabilities ([#18453](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18453)).

- **Infrastructure and Developer Experience:** CI/CD pipelines and node services received several key updates.
    - CI workflows were split into protected/unprotected flows ([#18443](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18443)) and permissions for fork builds were reduced to enhance security ([#18501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18501)).
    - The `op-supernode` gained a new `superroot_atTimestamp` API activity ([#18180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18180)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The project saw a mix of resolving long-standing bugs and opening new issues that outline future work on interoperability and performance.

- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues related to `op-challenger` support for ZK games were closed, marking the completion of a major workstream ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18321), [#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18412), [#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18413), [#18466](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18466)). The resolution of the `op-batcher` `MaxChannelDuration` bug ([#18092](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18092)) also fixed a key stability problem.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Critical Node Sync Issue:** A high-priority issue emerged where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart when using Reth, reportedly blocking Base Mainnet nodes ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18468)). This is under active investigation.
    - **Superchain Interoperability:** New issues were opened to advance Superchain functionality, including implementing chain-specific root claims in dispute games ([#18518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18518), [#18517](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18517)) and migrating services like `dispute-mon` to use supernode APIs ([#18523](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18523)).
    - **Future Work & Tooling:** A proposal was made to create a new `op-spammer` component to aid in automated bug detection on devnets ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18482)). Several new issues also focus on refining the `kona-sp1` program and its dependencies ([#18493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18493), [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18533)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both addressing critical bugs and planning future work. The active discussion around the `op-node` sync issue ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18468), [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18510)) highlighted effective communication between maintainers and node operators to diagnose a pressing problem. Furthermore, the period saw signs of new contributor engagement, with user "Himess" expressing interest in tackling several open issues related to contract comments and batcher code simplification ([#13435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13435), [#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18479)), indicating a healthy and welcoming environment for community involvement.
