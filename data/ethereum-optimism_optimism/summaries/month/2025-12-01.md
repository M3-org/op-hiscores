# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December was a month of significant progress in maturing the OP Stack, with a strong focus on enhancing the fault proof system and stabilizing core infrastructure. Development on optimistic ZK games accelerated, with the `op-challenger` gaining the ability to challenge, resolve, and reclaim bonds. Core components like `op-node` and `op-batcher` received critical bug fixes, improving overall network reliability. The month also saw foundational work for future Superchain interoperability with the introduction of the `op-interop-filter` service and new proof mechanisms. However, the discovery of a critical `op-node` sync bug and a contract vulnerability in `OptimismPortal2` highlighted ongoing challenges in maintaining a secure and robust multi-client ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### Optimistic ZK Games & Challenger Enhancements
The fault proof system saw major advancements, particularly in supporting optimistic ZK games. The `op-challenger` was heavily refactored to be more generic, moving `GameType` to a general package to accommodate ZK games ([#18432](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18432)). This foundational work was followed by the implementation of core challenger logic, including the ability to challenge unsafe proposals ([#18467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18467)), resolve games ([#18464](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18464)), and reclaim bonds ([#18465](https://github.comcom/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18465)). Testing was also bolstered with new tests for delegate-called precompiles ([#18475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18475)).

### Core Protocol & Contract Upgrades
The protocol's contract layer continued to evolve. `OPContractsManagerV2` (OPCMv2) was a central focus, with utilities being broken out into helper contracts to reduce code size and improve modularity ([#18454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18454)). The Custom Gas Token (CGT) feature was officially integrated as a system feature, removing the old dev flag ([#18405](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18405)) and adding support directly into OPCMv2 ([#18455](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18455)). In a move toward simplification, feature flags for Cannon-Kona and DisputeGame-V2 were removed, making them default behaviors ([#18208](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18208)). Security was also enhanced with the integration of Spearbit's audit report for the revenue sharing feature ([#18103](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18103)).

### Node Stability and Performance
Several critical bugs affecting core node components were addressed, improving network stability. The `op-node` received a fix for an issue where the L1 origin selector could get stuck during reorgs ([#18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)). The `op-batcher` saw multiple improvements, including a fix for `MaxChannelDuration` tracking with large block backlogs ([#18327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18327), [#18344](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18344)) and a change to exit on critical throttling RPC errors to prevent partial failures ([#17924](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17924)).

### Superchain Interoperability & Proofs
Foundational work began on enhancing cross-chain capabilities. The `op-supernode` was updated with a modular `superroot_atTimestamp` API ([#18180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18180)). A service skeleton for the new `op-interop-filter` was introduced, complete with flags and metrics, paving the way for future filtering logic ([#18456](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18456)). Towards the end of the month, work started on adding provable output roots to super dispute games, a key component for enhancing proof mechanisms ([#18605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18605)).

### Developer Tooling & CI/CD
The development pipeline and testing infrastructure received numerous upgrades. The CI workflow was split into protected/unprotected flows to enhance security ([#18443](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18443)) and permissions were reduced for fork builds ([#18501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18501)). The `op-deployer` was improved to use its own build for artifact publishing ([#18488](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18488)) and updated to support `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrades ([#18580](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18580)). Acceptance testing was also bolstered by integrating Kona, Rollup-Boost, and OP-Rbuilder as submodules, streamlining the test setup ([#18540](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18540)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
-   **Closed Issues:** Key problems resolved this month include the `op-batcher`'s `MaxChannelDuration` tracking bug for large backlogs ([#18092](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18092)), the finalization of several `op-challenger` enhancements for ZK games ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18321), [#18466](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18466)), and the removal of feature toggles for Kona and Cannon ([#18181](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18181)). An `op-node` synchronization failure was also resolved by upgrading `op-geth` ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18510)).

-   **New & Active Issues:** Several critical issues emerged this month. A high-priority bug was reported where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode, blocking Base Mainnet nodes ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18468)). A critical fuzzing test failure was discovered in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` related to null address handling, flagging a potential contract vulnerability ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18554)). Another issue reported `op-challenger` panicking when connected to older L1 clients that don't support `blobBaseFee` ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18608)). Significant design discussions are ongoing regarding the handling of replacement transactions for interop proofs ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574)) and the proposal to create a new `op-spammer` component for devnets ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18482)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This month saw healthy engagement from the wider community. A contributor named "Himess" showed notable initiative, expressing interest in tackling a range of open issues, from contract interface clarifications ([#9697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/9697)) to batcher code simplification ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18479)) and adding a replica healthcheck to `op-rbuilder` ([#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17685)). This signals a welcoming environment for new contributors to get involved. Collaboration between maintainers and node operators was evident in the active triage of critical bugs, such as the `op-node` sync issue ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18468)), where detailed logs and configurations were requested to diagnose the problem. The creation of an issue to document the release process ([#18592](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18592)) also points to an internal effort to improve transparency and collaboration.
