# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (December 2024)

## üöÄ Highlights
Development in December was characterized by planning and problem identification rather than active code contribution. Activity centered on opening strategic issues that outline future work on protocol design and consensus mechanisms. Key discussions emerged around troubleshooting core components, notably the `op-proposer`. While no new features or fixes were merged, the issues raised this month point to a focus on enhancing protocol robustness and developer experience in upcoming development cycles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, there were no new features, bug fixes, or other code contributions merged during this period. Development activity was focused on issue creation and discussion.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The month's activity was concentrated on identifying and defining new work items and troubleshooting existing component configurations.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed within December.

- **New & Active Issues:** Three significant issues were opened, outlining future development and addressing immediate configuration problems:
    - **Creator Pattern Implementation ([#13168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13168)):** A new issue was opened to track the design and implementation of a "Creator" pattern for contracts, including necessary changes to the OPCM (Optimism Payload Communication Manager). This signals planning for new smart contract architecture patterns.
    - **Consensus Event Nonce Tracking ([#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13543)):** A tracking issue was created to monitor the potential implementation of a nonce for L1 events that influence consensus, such as `SystemConfig.ConfigUpdate` and `OptimismPortal2.Transact`. This indicates strategic thinking around improving the determinism and security of L1-L2 interactions.
    - **`op-proposer` Configuration Failures ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13502)):** An important issue was raised concerning `op-proposer` failures, where it would encounter an `execution reverted` error. The subsequent discussion was crucial, with community members diagnosing the problem. The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration of the game factory address and an incorrect `--game-type` flag, which needed to be set properly for the `PermissionedFaultDisputeGame`.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration in December was most visible through community-driven troubleshooting. The discussion on the `op-proposer` issue ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13502)) showcased effective collaboration, with multiple contributors (`protolambda`, `mw2000`, `asymmetric`, `dariusL3`) working together to diagnose the configuration error and confirm the solution. Overall, the low volume of pull requests and merged code suggests a quiet month, typical for the end of the year, with the community's focus shifting from active coding to planning and support.
