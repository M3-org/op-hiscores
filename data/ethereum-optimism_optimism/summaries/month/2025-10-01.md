# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of significant hardening and preparation for future network upgrades. Development was dominated by a massive push to improve testing infrastructure, introducing a "flake-shaker" system and nightly fuzz testing to bolster CI/CD reliability. Substantial progress was made on key features for the upcoming Jovian upgrade, including a consensus-breaking update to the operator fee formula and the implementation of the Data Availability (DA) footprint limit. Concurrently, the team enhanced the robustness of the dispute monitoring system and refined deployment tooling to support new contract versions, ensuring the core protocol remains secure and stable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on improving system reliability from testing through to production monitoring and preparing for the next major upgrade.

-   **Testing and CI/CD Overhaul:** A major theme was the systematic improvement of test stability and coverage.
    -   A "flake-shaker" system was introduced to run tests multiple times to detect and prevent flaky tests from being merged ([#17646]).
    -   CI was enhanced with a nightly heavy fuzz testing job for smart contracts ([#17668]), consolidated workflows for `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17673]), and numerous fixes to improve stability and reporting ([#17830], [#17891]).
    -   Test coverage was expanded with new unit tests for `DevFeatures.sol` ([#17643]), L1 Osaka activation tests ([#17666]), and a variety of new acceptance tests for EL Sync, reorgs, and gap-filling scenarios ([#17894], [#17893]).

-   **Jovian Upgrade Preparation:** Significant progress was made on features slated for the Jovian upgrade.
    -   A consensus-breaking change was implemented to update the operator fee formula for increased utility, requiring modifications across core components ([#17366]).
    -   Work on the Jovian DA footprint block limit continued, adding configurability and integration with `op-geth` ([#17466]).
    -   The `OPCM.deploy` function was updated to support v2 dispute games, deploying `PermissionedDisputeGameV2` when the feature is active ([#17408]).

-   **Dispute Monitoring and Fault Tolerance:** The `op-dispute-mon` component received critical updates to improve its reliability.
    -   The monitor was enhanced to distinguish between transport-level 404 errors and actual "output root not found" conditions, crucial for multi-node support ([#17819]).
    -   A key logic change was made to consider a rollup node invalid if it has not processed L1 data past the dispute game's creation, preventing incorrect disagreement flags from out-of-sync nodes ([#17831]).

-   **Deployment and Configuration Tooling:** The project's deployment and contract management tools were updated to support new versions and improve flexibility.
    -   `op-deployer` was updated to support upgrades up to v4.1.0 ([#17824]) and a critical bug was fixed that broke upgrade commands ([#17848]).
    -   The OP Contracts Manager (`opcm`) now supports Cannon and Kona games in `updatePrestates` ([#17512]).
    -   The `TimelockGuard` implementation was completed, enhancing security with external signature validation ([#17584]).

-   **Core Protocol and Node Enhancements:** The core node software saw several important refinements.
    -   The `op-supernode` project was initiated with the introduction of the Chain Container Framework, designed to enable multi-tenant Consensus Layer functionality ([#17659]).
    -   `op-node` and related components now embed the `L1ChainConfig` directly, improving handling of L1 block info post-Ecotone ([#17568]).
    -   `op-geth` was updated to the "fusaka defence cherry pick" commit to integrate the latest fixes ([#17661]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

-   **Closed Issues:** Several significant trackers and long-standing issues were resolved this month.
    -   **Upgrades & Milestones:** The tracker for the Isthmus Upgrade was closed, marking its completion ([#12703]). Milestone 1 for the `OP Supernode` project was also completed ([#17558]).
    -   **Jovian & Fusaka Readiness:** Key implementation issues for the Jovian DA footprint limit and Scalar Fix were closed ([#17280], [#17002]). Multiple issues related to preparing Flashblocks components for the Fusaka upgrade were also resolved ([#17853], [#17854], [#17855]).
    -   **Testing & Monitoring:** The critical issue for fixing `op-dispute-mon`'s handling of out-of-sync nodes was resolved ([#17814]). The migration of `devnet-sdk` tests to `devstack` was also completed ([#15574]).

-   **New & Active Issues:** New discussions centered on upgrade complexities, infrastructure stability, and performance.
    -   **Cannon/Go Compatibility:** A critical ongoing issue is the incompatibility of Cannon with Go 1.25, which causes incorrect Keccak hashes and impacts block hash calculations ([#17060]).
    -   **Jovian Operator Fee:** New issues were opened concerning the Jovian operator fee changes, including the need for tests for pre-Jovian parameter setting ([#17897]) and a problem where marshaling new `SystemConfig` fields is breaking zk stacks ([#17907]).
    -   **Infrastructure Stability:** Concerns were raised about `op-conductor` stability ([#17899]), Flashblocks websocket timeouts ([#17858]), and the Sepolia `op-node` failing to fetch blobs ([#17871]), highlighting the challenges of maintaining complex distributed infrastructure.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development activity in October showcased a high degree of focused, collaborative effort. The intense work on the testing infrastructure, with numerous interconnected PRs for `flake-shake` and `op-acceptance-tests`, points to a coordinated team-wide push for quality.

The discussion around `op-dispute-mon`'s handling of out-of-sync nodes ([#17814]) was a prime example of collaborative problem-solving, with multiple maintainers weighing in to diagnose the complex state-synchronization issue and arrive at a robust solution. Similarly, the diagnosis of the Cannon and Go 1.25 compatibility bug ([#17060]) involved detailed analysis and communication to pinpoint an upstream dependency issue. This pattern of deep-diving into complex technical challenges reflects a healthy and engaged contributor community focused on the long-term stability of the OP Stack.
