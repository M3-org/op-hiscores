# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of significant hardening and infrastructure enhancement for the OP Stack. Development was heavily focused on bolstering the reliability of the entire system through a major push in testing infrastructure, including the introduction of the "flake-shaker" system for test stability and new nightly fuzz testing jobs. Key components like the `op-deployer` and `op-dispute-mon` received critical updates to support new contract versions and improve monitoring accuracy. While substantial progress was made in closing out testing and upgrade-related trackers, challenging new issues emerged around `op-conductor` health and performance, and active discussions continue on resolving a critical Cannon compatibility bug with Go 1.25.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving test coverage, strengthening core components, and refining deployment tooling.

- **Advanced Testing and CI/CD Infrastructure:**
  - A new "flake-shaker" system was introduced to automatically detect and report flaky tests by running them multiple times, enhancing the reliability of the test suite ([#17646], [#17830]).
  - CI was strengthened with a new nightly job for heavy fuzz testing of smart contracts ([#17668]) and the consolidation of `op-acceptance-tests` workflows ([#17673]).
  - Test coverage was expanded with new unit tests for `DevFeatures.sol` ([#17643]) and new acceptance tests validating L1 Osaka activation ([#17666]), unsafe chain stalling logic ([#17696]), and EL payload caching ([#17675]).

- **Core Protocol and Node Enhancements:**
  - The L1ChainConfig is now embedded directly into the configuration for `op-node`, `op-program`, and `kona`, improving the handling of L1 block info and blob base fees post-Ecotone ([#17568]).
  - The `op-node` architecture was simplified by merging the `EngineResetDeriver` with the `EngineController`, reducing complexity ([#17662]).
  - A new flag was added to `op-service/L1BeaconClient` and related components to optionally skip blob proof verification, providing more flexibility ([#17713], [#17718]).
  - `op-geth` was updated to integrate the latest "fusaka defence cherry pick" improvements ([#17661]).

- **Deployment and Contract Management:**
  - The `op-deployer` was significantly updated to support and test upgrades up to contract version v4.1.0, ensuring compatibility with the latest releases ([#17824]).
  - The OP Contracts Manager (`opcm`) was enhanced to support Cannon and Kona fault-proof games ([#17512]).
  - A full implementation of the `TimelockGuard` was completed, adding external signature validation to bolster security for Safe transactions ([#17584]).

- **Dispute Monitor Robustness:**
  - `op-dispute-mon` was improved to correctly distinguish between a transport-level 404 error and a genuine "output root not found" condition, which is critical for accurate monitoring across multiple nodes ([#17819]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month saw the closure of major testing and upgrade initiatives, while new discussions focused on synchronization, performance, and external dependencies.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Testing & Devnet Initiative:** A significant milestone was reached with the closure of several long-standing tracker issues related to migrating `devnet-sdk` tests to `devstack` ([#15574]), simplifying interop testing ([#16442]), and completing the reorg testing checklist ([#14530]).
  - **Network Upgrade Completion:** The main tracker for the Isthmus Upgrade was closed, marking its successful completion ([#12703]). The issue for a Fusaka activation test was also resolved ([#17500]).
  - **`rollup-boost` Health:** Issues related to implementing and deploying a partial healthiness tolerance for `op-rbuilder` failures in `op-conductor` were closed, improving sequencer stability ([#17678], [#17680]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **`op-dispute-mon` Synchronization Logic ([#17814]):** A critical discussion is ongoing on how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes when multiple RPCs are configured. The challenge is to reliably differentiate a lagging node from one on an incorrect fork. The proposed solution involves checking the `CurrentL1` from the node's sync status to ensure it has processed the relevant L1 block.
  - **Cannon Compatibility with Go 1.25 ([#17060]):** This active issue highlights a significant blocker where Go 1.25 produces incorrect Keccak hashes within Cannon, affecting block hash calculations. The root cause has been traced to an upstream Go issue, and the team is tracking it closely.
  - **`op-conductor` and Flashblocks Health ([#17835]):** A new issue was opened to investigate raft timeouts and errors in `op-conductor` when streaming flashblocks, pointing to potential bottlenecks in the sequencing pipeline.
  - **Flashblocks Performance Tuning ([#17676], [#17677]):** New initiatives were started to load test 200ms Flashblocks on a devnet, signaling a push towards further reducing block times and improving performance.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident in the deep technical discussions surrounding active issues. The diagnosis of the Cannon/Go 1.25 bug ([#17060]) and the complex logic for `op-dispute-mon` synchronization ([#17814]) involved detailed back-and-forth between multiple core developers, showcasing collaborative problem-solving on challenging issues. Furthermore, maintainer guidance was visible in the triage process, such as clarifying the scope of an issue related to replica health checks ([#17686]) and directing it to the appropriate team. The focused effort on testing infrastructure and dispute monitoring suggests strong coordination within dedicated development pods.
