# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of significant progress on core protocol upgrades and a deep investment in testing infrastructure. Development was heavily focused on advancing the Jovian upgrade, highlighted by the implementation of a consensus-breaking operator fee formula and progress on the Data Availability (DA) footprint limit. A major theme was enhancing test reliability with the introduction of a "flake-shaker" system and a new nightly heavy fuzz testing job to proactively detect instability. Concurrently, the dispute monitoring system was made more robust, and foundational work began on the `op-supernode` framework, setting the stage for future multi-chain capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on preparing for the Jovian upgrade, hardening the testing pipeline, and refining core node components.

### Testing and CI/CD Overhaul
A substantial effort was dedicated to improving the stability and coverage of the entire testing suite.
- **Flake Detection:** A "flake-shaker" system was introduced to validate test stability by running tests multiple times, with numerous PRs dedicated to fixing miscellaneous issues and promoting stable tests ([#17646], [#17830], [#17851], [#17891]).
- **Enhanced CI:** A nightly CI job for heavy fuzz testing of smart contracts was implemented ([#17668]), and CI workflows for `op-acceptance-tests` were consolidated ([#17673]).
- **New Test Coverage:** A wide range of new tests were added, including unit tests for `DevFeatures.sol` ([#17643]), acceptance tests for L1 Osaka activation ([#17666]), unsafe chain stalling ([#17696]), and various EL Sync and reorg scenarios ([#17893], [#17894]). Test coverage was also improved for components like `ResourceMetering` and `SafeSend` ([#17812], [#17896]).

### Jovian Upgrade Progression
Significant strides were made on features planned for the Jovian network upgrade.
- **Operator Fee Formula:** A consensus-breaking feature was merged to update the operator fee formula for increased utility, impacting `op-node`, `op-e2e`, and `contracts-bedrock` ([#17366]).
- **DA Footprint Limit:** Work continued on the Jovian DA footprint block limit, adding configurability and integrating it with `op-geth` ([#17466]). Acceptance tests for this feature were also completed ([#17278]).
- **Dispute Game V2:** The `OPCM.deploy` function was updated to deploy the `PermissionedDisputeGameV2` implementation, preparing for the next generation of fault proofs ([#17408]).

### Dispute Monitoring and Fault Proof Enhancements
The `op-dispute-mon` component and related contracts received critical updates to improve reliability.
- **Sync-Aware Monitoring:** The dispute monitor was updated to correctly handle out-of-sync nodes by checking if a node has processed the relevant L1 block, preventing false disagreements ([#17831], [#17819]).
- **Contract Management:** The OP Contracts Manager (`opcm`) was updated to support Cannon and Kona games ([#17512]) and a full implementation of the `TimelockGuard` was completed for enhanced security ([#17584]).

### Core Protocol and Node Architecture Refinements
The underlying node software and protocol logic saw several key improvements.
- **`op-supernode`:** Initial work began on the `op-supernode` with the introduction of the Chain Container Framework, designed to enable multi-tenant Consensus Layer functionality ([#17659]).
- **Configuration & Architecture:** The L1ChainConfig is now embedded directly into the configuration for `op-node`, `op-program`, and `kona` for better handling of L1 block info ([#17568]). In `op-node`, the `EngineResetDeriver` was merged with `EngineController` to streamline architecture ([#17662]).

### Deployment Tooling Improvements
The `op-deployer` and related tools were enhanced to support new features and fix critical bugs.
- **Upgrade Support:** The `op-deployer` was updated to support upgrades up to v4.1.0 ([#17824]). A critical bug was fixed where upgrade commands were broken, ensuring robust artifact downloads during the deployment process ([#17848]).
- **Gas Optimization:** The default `GasPadFactor` in `op-deployer` was reduced to keep deployment transactions within gas limits ([#17710]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The month saw the resolution of major upgrade trackers and testing initiatives, while new discussions emerged around the downstream impact of upcoming changes and infrastructure reliability.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Major Upgrades:** The tracker for the Isthmus Upgrade was closed, marking a significant milestone ([#12703]).
  - **Testing & Devnet:** Several long-standing trackers for devnet migration, interop testing, and reorg testing were completed ([#15574], [#14122], [#14530]).
  - **Jovian & Flashblocks:** Key issues for the DA Footprint Limit tests ([#17278]), the Scalar Fix implementation ([#17002]), and Fusaka readiness for Flashblocks components were resolved ([#17853], [#17854], [#17855]).
  - **Dispute Monitoring:** A critical issue regarding `op-dispute-mon`'s handling of out-of-sync nodes was fixed and closed ([#17814]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Go Compatibility:** A significant ongoing technical challenge is the incompatibility of Cannon with Go 1.25, which causes incorrect Keccak hashes. The issue is being tracked and diagnosed in detail ([#17060]).
  - **Jovian Implementation Risks:** A new concern was raised that marshaling new `SystemConfig` fields for the Jovian operator fee change before the fork is active could break downstream consumers like ZK stacks ([#17907]).
  - **Infrastructure Challenges:** Several new issues were opened related to infrastructure, including `op-conductor` sequencing failures ([#17899]), Flashblocks websocket timeouts ([#17858]), and the Sepolia `op-node` failing to fetch blobs ([#17871]).
  - **Dispute Monitor Performance:** A new issue noted that `op-dispute-mon` calls `optimism_syncStatus` too frequently, indicating a need for optimization ([#17886]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was characterized by focused, intensive efforts within specific domains. The flurry of activity around the "flake-shaker" system and CI/CD enhancements points to a dedicated push from the protocol development experience team to improve engineering velocity and confidence. The detailed, multi-participant discussions in issues like `op-dispute-mon`'s sync handling ([#17814]) and Cannon's Go 1.25 compatibility ([#17060]) highlight a culture of thorough technical investigation and collaborative problem-solving. The interconnected nature of PRs related to the Jovian upgrade and dispute game enhancements suggests tight coordination between the smart contract and core client development teams.
