# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (February 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
Development in February focused on enhancing the stability and reliability of core OP Stack components. A significant architectural discussion began around deprecating the `req-resp` P2P sync protocol in `op-node` to resolve persistent sync issues, with proposals for a simpler, more robust alternative. Concurrently, a critical bug affecting the `op-proposer` was resolved, improving the stability of the dispute game system. This month's efforts were centered on hardening the existing protocol and planning for future performance improvements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features or code changes were merged this month based on the provided reports. Development activity was concentrated on resolving critical issues and engaging in architectural design discussions for future protocol enhancements.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month targeted both immediate bug fixes and long-term architectural improvements, particularly concerning node synchronization and the dispute game mechanism.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Dispute Game Stability:** A key issue ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13502)) causing `op-proposer` to fail when creating transactions was resolved. The problem was traced to a misconfiguration of the dispute game type or its underlying contract implementation, and the fix ensures the stability of this crucial component.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Rethinking `op-node` Sync Protocol:** A major new issue ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14108)) was opened to track the proposed deprecation of the `req-resp` P2P sync protocol. Active discussions highlight the current protocol's drawbacks, including slowness, complexity, and race conditions that hinder node stability. An alternative, prototyped by a contributor, proposes a simpler and more efficient unsafe block sync mechanism, potentially using a centralized driver like Redis to publish blocks, which would complement the existing P2P gossip layer.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions surrounding future architectural changes. The proposal to improve the `op-node` sync mechanism in issue [#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14108) was notably driven by a prototype from community member @emilianobonassi, sparking a productive conversation about the trade-offs between the current P2P implementation and a simpler, centralized driver approach for syncing unsafe blocks. This highlights a healthy dynamic of community-driven innovation and open design discussion.
