# ethereum-optimism/optimism Monthly Report (April 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
April's development activity centered on protocol security and integrity analysis. The primary focus was on processing findings from an external security audit conducted by Spearbit. A key issue was identified and logged concerning a potential vulnerability in the `op-program`'s state transition logic, prompting discussion around a specification-level fix. Overall, the month was characterized by diligent review and planning based on audit feedback rather than new feature implementation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, there were no new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, or documentation enhancements merged during this period. The development efforts were concentrated on identifying and analyzing potential issues.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The management of issues was a key activity in April, with a focus on addressing external audit findings.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed this month.

- **New & Active Issues:** A significant new issue was opened, highlighting a potential protocol vulnerability.
    - **Audit Finding:** Issue [#15217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15217) was created to track an invalid pending progress length check within the `op-program: stateTransition` function. This finding, originating from a Spearbit audit, points to a potential vulnerability during the consolidation step. Initial discussion on the issue confirmed its validity and proposed a fix to the specification regarding the maximum number of chains.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was demonstrated through the engagement with external security auditors. The discussion and validation of the Spearbit audit finding in issue [#15217] was the most notable collaborative activity, showcasing the project's process for integrating external feedback to enhance protocol security.
