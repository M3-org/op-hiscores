# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jun 8, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the robustness and upgrade capabilities of the Optimism stack. Key achievements include adding support for v4.0.0 upgrades and validation in `op-deployer`, improving `op-batcher`'s sync status detection, and refining `op-node`'s unsafe head search for better reorg handling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Deployment and Validation Capabilities
*   Added support for upgrading and validating v4.0.0 configurations within `op-deployer`, crucial for future network upgrades and ensuring compatibility. ([#16048](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16048))

### Improved Batcher and Node Robustness
*   Implemented a more robust method for `op-batcher` to detect "not yet ready" sync statuses, preventing issues with invalid or incomplete L2 sync data. ([#16298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16298))
*   Modified `op-node` to search for the latest valid unsafe head backwards during supervisor-instructed resets, optimizing for common L1 reorg scenarios. ([#16312](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16312))

## NEW ISSUES

### Documentation and Tooling Gaps for Interop Updates
*   A new bug report highlights insufficient documentation and tooling support for developers implementing custom bridges or sequencers following recent Optimism Bedrock/Interop updates, specifically concerning `OptimismPortal2.sol`. ([#16331](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16331))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### State Dumping Functionality
*   Issue [#390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/390) discusses the ability to dump all state of addresses, similar to `alloc` in `genesis.json`. A recent comment from @0xWilliamWang on June 8, 2025, asks for a solution, indicating ongoing interest in this feature despite the issue being marked as closed in October 2024.
