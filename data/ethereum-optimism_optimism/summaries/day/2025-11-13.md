# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, improving documentation for Graphite, and significant updates to the `op-node` for P2P and EL sync. Several key issues related to sync mechanisms were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing and Infrastructure Updates
Significant efforts were made to improve the testing suite and underlying infrastructure. This included updating `op-acceptor` to v3.6.6 ([#18266](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18266)), improving RLPReader test coverage and organization ([#18232](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18232)), and increasing resources for the heavy-fuzz CI job to prevent OOM errors ([#18276](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18276)). Additionally, a workaround in `op-acceptance` related to L2 user creation was removed as it was no longer necessary ([#18265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18265)). The Go version was also updated to 1.25.4 ([#18247](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18247)).

### `op-node` and `op-supernode` Improvements
The `op-node` received a critical update to perform ELSync gap filling by updating `OnUnsafeL2Payload`, which also deprecates RR sync functionality ([#17751](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17751)). A related bug in the `PeekUnsafePayload` test name was also fixed ([#18268](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18268)). For `op-supernode`, P2P was enabled for Virtual Nodes, allowing for better network interaction ([#18213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18213)).

### Documentation and Code Quality
Documentation for Graphite was enhanced with a new rule to prevent incorrect flagging of `vm.expectRevert` patterns with low-level calls ([#18272](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18272)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Sync Mechanism Deprecation and Replacement
The issue of supporting multiple ELSync runs to replace RR Sync functionality was closed ([#17627](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17627)). This was a significant step towards removing ReqRes P2P sync, with discussions focusing on how the `op-node` should interact with the EL node during `SYNCING` mode and handling `INVALID` responses from `engine_forkChoiceUpdated`. The related testing issue for removing RR Sync was also closed ([#17694](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17694)).

### Infrastructure and Tooling Updates
The issue regarding `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` supporting sysext was closed ([#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16704)), with the reason cited as Kurtosis being deprecated.

## NEW ISSUES

### Kona Prestate Support
A tracking issue was opened to add support for embedded custom prestates to Kona ([#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18271)). A fix for this is currently under review.

### CI/CD Pipeline Failures
An oncall issue was created to address failing artifact publishing workflows ([#18273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18273)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Reports
The issue [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1148) concerns updating the `print_staging_report` script to be compatible with dispute-game v2. Recent comments highlight the need to adapt the script to read `gameArgs` from the DGF storage, as the current method reads from the game implementation contract. There's also a discussion about the script's assumption of only Permissioned and Permissionless games, which will change with two permissionless games, potentially impacting the JSON output format.
