# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, refining node synchronization mechanisms, and improving documentation for developer tools. Key updates include improved RLPReader test coverage and critical fixes for `op-node` synchronization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing and Acceptance Framework
Significant efforts were made to improve the testing infrastructure, including comprehensive test coverage for the RLPReader library and updates to the `op-acceptance-tests` for better reliability.
- Improved RLPReader test coverage and organization ([#18232](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18232))
- Updated `op-acceptor` to v3.6.6 for acceptance tests ([#18266](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18266))
- Removed a workaround in `op-acceptance-tests` related to L2 user nonce calculation ([#18265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18265))

### Node Synchronization and P2P Improvements
Updates to `op-node` focused on refining the synchronization process, particularly by integrating ELSync for gap filling and enabling P2P for virtual nodes in `op-supernode`.
- `op-node` updated to perform ELSync gap filling and deprecate RR sync ([#17751](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17751))
- Fixed a test name in `op-node` related to `PeekUnsafePayload` ([#18268](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18268))
- Enabled P2P for Virtual Nodes in `op-supernode` ([#18213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18213))

### Developer Tooling and Documentation Updates
Documentation for the Graphite bot was enhanced to prevent incorrect flagging of `vm.expectRevert` patterns, and the Go version was updated across the repository.
- Added a rule to Graphite documentation to prevent flagging correct `vm.expectRevert` patterns with low-level calls ([#18272](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18272))
- Updated Go version to 1.25.4 ([#18247](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18247))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Node Synchronization Enhancements
Two issues related to `op-node` synchronization were closed, marking progress in refining how the node handles L2 chain data and removes reliance on ReqRes P2P sync.
- `op-node`: Support multiple ELSync runs ([#17627](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17627))
- Remove RR Sync: Testing ([#17694](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17694))

### Infrastructure Deprecation
An issue concerning `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` support for `sysext` was closed due to the deprecation of Kurtosis.
- `op-sync-tester`, `op-devstack`: Support `sysext` ([#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16704))

## NEW ISSUES

### Kona Prestate Support
A new tracking issue has been opened to add support for embedded custom prestates to Kona.
- [tracking]: Add support for embedded custom prestates to kona ([#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18271))

### Artifact Publishing Failures
An oncall issue was created to address recurring failures in artifact publishing workflows.
- oncall: Artifact publishing workflows fail ([#18273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18273))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Reports
Discussion continues on updating the `print_staging_report` script to be compatible with Dispute Game v2 ([#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1148)). The script currently reads game arguments from the game implementation contract, and the challenge is to adapt this to read from `gameArgs` storage in the DGF. There are concerns about the script's assumption of only Permissioned and Permissionless games, as there will be two permissionless games, potentially impacting the JSON output format. The latest comment from kelvin7891 clarifies the need to adapt the script to read from `gameArgs` storage in the DGF, while ajsutton noted that the script currently only reads from the permissioned game, suggesting the format might not need to change significantly.
