# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, fixing a compiler warning, and improving CI efficiency. Key updates include adding Go 1.25 tests for Cannon and de-flaking an E2E test.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing and CI Efficiency
Significant work was done to improve the testing framework and continuous integration processes. This includes adding a "latest" artifact fallback to reduce PR build times for contracts ([#18291](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18291)), and de-flaking the `TestMissingBatchE2E` by retrying inclusion checks during EL indexing ([#18304](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18304)). Additionally, version validation tests were added for the WETH contract ([#18303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18303)), and the `SuperchainConfigImpl` address was updated in `init_test` for `op-deployer` ([#18309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18309)).

### Cannon Go 1.25 Support
Unit tests were added to Cannon to ensure compatibility with Go 1.25, addressing a previously identified issue ([#18279](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18279)). This expands the range of Go versions supported for Cannon's MIPS EVM.

### Compiler Warning Enforcement
A bug fix was implemented to enforce compiler warnings in contracts by adding `deny_warnings = true` to `foundry.toml` and fixing test return value checks ([#18264](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18264)). This improves code quality and prevents potential issues.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#18308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18308) op-batcher: simplify trySignal, reduce parameters
- [#18306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18306) fix(verify): derive constructor args by stripping init code prefix from tx input
- [#18305](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18305) fix(op-node): fix channel size calculation bug when pruning frames

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolved Flaky Tests and Deprecated Features
Several flaky tests were closed, including `TestMissingBatchE2E` ([#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18138)) and `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17966)), indicating improved test stability. Additionally, issues related to deprecated features like `op-devstack: sysext: fix address book` ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15817)) were closed due to the deprecation of KT.

### Cannon and OPCM Compatibility
The issue regarding Cannon's support for Go 1.25 ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17060)) was closed, indicating successful integration. Similarly, the issue concerning Kona + Cannon OPCM support ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17285)) was closed, confirming compatibility.

### General Cleanup and Age-Related Closures
Multiple older issues were closed due to age or being resolved in later releases. This includes issues like `L2 networks diverge over multiple reorg test runs` ([#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15782)), `op-supervisor: Event System Limitations Encountered During Sync` ([#16110](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16110)), and `op-node v1.13.3: thousands of stuck goroutines in p2p.SyncClient / libp2p` ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16332)). Issues related to `op-up` such as `support netchef-style inventory files` ([#17006](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17006)) and `Define config schema` ([#17225](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17225)) were also closed.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-devstack: sysext: fix address book` ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15817))
This issue was reopened by ajsutton, who noted that there are still several TODOs related to cleaning up Event System Refactor Comments across various files in `op-node`, `op-e2e`, and `op-supervisor`. The issue also highlights a need to address `op-devstack/sysext/addrbook.go:26` and `op-supervisor/supervisor/backend/backend.go:603`.

### `min-base-fee: conduct simulations which prove effectiveness of the feature` ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16958))
mslipper inquired whether this issue is still relevant to current development efforts.

### `min-base-fee: runbook for low batcher throughput` ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16959))
mslipper also asked if this issue remains relevant, which focuses on alerting and runbooks for detecting and responding to high `MinBaseFee` settings that could impact transaction inclusion.

### `op-acceptance-test: add back op-reth to jovian kt-devnet` ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17475))
mslipper questioned the current relevance of this issue. geoknee previously suggested that since Kurtosis devnet is deprecated, the focus should shift to integrating `op-reth` into the `devstack / sysgo` system instead.

### `Flaky test: TestBreakTimestampInvariant` ([#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18137))
mslipper provided an example failure link for this flaky test, indicating it is still an active problem.
