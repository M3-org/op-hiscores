# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, particularly for Cannon and contract builds, alongside critical bug fixes and minor service improvements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing & CI Efficiency
Significant work was done to improve the efficiency and coverage of tests. This includes adding a "latest" artifact fallback to reduce CI build times for contracts [#18291](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18291) and introducing comprehensive Go 1.25 tests for Cannon [#18279](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18279). A test for version validation in the WETH contract was also added [#18303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18303).

### Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements
A key bug fix involved enforcing compiler warnings and correcting test return value checks in contracts [#18264](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18264). Additionally, a flakiness issue in `TestMissingBatchE2E` was addressed by retrying inclusion checks during EL indexing [#18304](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18304).

### Deployment & Service Updates
The `SuperchainConfigImpl` address was updated in `op-deployer`'s init test [#18309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18309). The `op-service` logging now includes `logfmtms` for improved log format usage [#18297](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18297).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Cannon & Go 1.25 Compatibility
The issue of Cannon supporting Go 1.25 was closed [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17060), following the addition of unit tests for Go 1.25 support.

### Interop & Supervisor Enhancements
Several issues related to Interop and the `op-supervisor` were closed, including dropping multi-node support [#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16174), addressing event system limitations [#16110](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16110), removing anchor point RPC [#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16140), and improving L1 origin validity handling during resets [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16315).

### General Maintenance & Flaky Test Resolution
Various maintenance issues were closed, such as fixing the `op-devstack` address book [#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15817), resolving L2 network divergence in reorg tests [#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15782), and addressing a flaky `TestMissingBatchE2E` [#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18138). Several older issues were closed due to age, including Engine API status/error return values [#596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/596) and `op-geth` full node state DB corruption [#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/549).

### Execution Multiplexing & Min Base Fee Tracking
Tracking issues for Execution Multiplexing [#16809](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16809), its initial implementation [#16822](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16822), and Min Base Fee [#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16807) were closed.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Min Base Fee Simulations & Runbook
Discussions continue on conducting simulations to prove the effectiveness of the `MinBaseFee` feature [#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16958) and creating a runbook for low batcher throughput scenarios [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16959). @mslipper inquired about the current relevance of these issues to @geoknee.

### `op-reth` Integration in Acceptance Tests
The issue of adding `op-reth` back to the Jovian `kt-devnet` in `op-acceptance-test` is active [#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17475). @mslipper asked @geoknee and @theochap about its relevance, following @geoknee's comment that `kurtosis devnet` is deprecated and `op-reth` should be integrated into `devstack / sysgo` instead.

### Flaky Test: `TestBreakTimestampInvariant`
The flakiness of `TestBreakTimestampInvariant` is being tracked [#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18137), with @mslipper providing an example failure.
