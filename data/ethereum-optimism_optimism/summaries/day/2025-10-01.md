# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 1, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure with new unit tests for `DevFeatures.sol` and the introduction of a flake-shaker system for test stability. Significant CI/CD improvements were made, including consolidating workflows and adding a nightly heavy fuzz testing job. Several issues related to devnet migration and interop testing were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing and CI/CD Infrastructure
*   Added unit tests for `DevFeatures.sol` and its corresponding Go code, improving contract reliability ([#17643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17643)).
*   Introduced "flake-shaker," a system to validate test stability by running tests multiple times to detect flakiness before production deployment ([#17646](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17646)).
*   Consolidated CI workflows for `op-acceptance-tests`, streamlining the pre/post-merge to develop process ([#17673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17673)).
*   Implemented a new nightly CI job for heavy fuzz testing of smart contracts, utilizing `ciheavy` Foundry profile for extensive runs to catch edge cases ([#17668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17668)).
*   Updated Discord notifications for `op-acceptance-tests` CI, directing alerts to the 'protocol devx pod' role ([#17672](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17672)).

### Core Protocol Updates
*   Updated `op-geth` to the "fusaka defence cherry pick" commit, ensuring the latest improvements and fixes are integrated ([#17661](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17661)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Devnet and Interop Testing Enhancements
*   Migration of `devnet-sdk` acceptance tests to the `devstack` framework was completed ([#15574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15574)).
*   The `interop: follow-mode / simplify / embed` tracker issue was closed ([#16442](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16442)).
*   The `interop: test sequencing tracker` issue, focused on implementing the test sequencing design document, has been closed ([#14122](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14122)).
*   The `devnet-sdk: expand devstack DSL` issue, aimed at improving the DSL for testing components, has been closed ([#15137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15137)).

### Protocol and Error Handling Improvements
*   Cleanup of error handling in `op-node` derivation was completed ([#10725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10725)).
*   The issue regarding fixing source map lookups in `SourceMapFS` within `op-chain-ops` has been closed ([#13236](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13236)).

### Reorg Testing and Flashblocks
*   The reorg testing checklist has been completed ([#14530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14530)).
*   Refinement of alerts and runbooks for flashblocks has been completed ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17423)).

### `op-node` Architecture Refinement
*   The issue to split `op-node` CLI/entrypoint/service/backend was closed as not planned, following a spike that indicated it was not supported ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16680)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Flashblocks and Performance Optimization
*   **Flashblocks Performance Tuning:** Issues were opened to enable 200ms Flashblocks on a devnet and conduct load tests against it to compare performance with 250ms counterparts ([#17676](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17676), [#17677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17677)).
*   **Sequencing Infrastructure:** Discussions initiated on shifting Sepolia sequencing to full-nodes to improve performance and considering `snapman` for Reth snapshots of full nodes ([#17681](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17681), [#17684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17684)).

### Health Checks and Monitoring
*   **`op-rbuilder` Health Checks:** New issues propose implementing `replica-healthcheck` for `op-rbuilder` to track non-divergence from `op-geth` and introducing a partial healthiness tolerance for `rollup-boost` ([#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17685), [#17678](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17678)).
*   **Monitoring Multiple Health Checks:** An issue was created to ensure graceful monitoring and alerting for multiple `replica-healthchecks` per namespace, especially with the addition of `op-rbuilder` checks ([#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17686)).
*   **Deployment of Healthiness Tolerance:** An issue was opened to roll out the `rollup-boost` partial healthiness tolerance to devnet, Sepolia, and mainnet ([#17680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17680)).
