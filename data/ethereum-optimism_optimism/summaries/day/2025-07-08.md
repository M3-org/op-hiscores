# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 8, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, refactoring the op-supervisor for improved efficiency, and consolidating interop APIs. Key updates include test validation compliance and a new test for safe head database behavior.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Test Validation and Coverage
Significant progress was made in improving the robustness and compliance of the testing suite. This includes updating existing tests to meet validation scripts and adding new tests to cover critical scenarios.
- Test validation compliance for `/L2` tests was achieved, removing them from the exclusion list and ensuring consistency across the test suite ([#16607](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16607)).
- A new test was added to `op-acceptance` to verify safe head database behavior when the Execution Layer (EL) state is deleted, crucial for maintaining data integrity during EL syncs ([#16627](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16627)).

### Op-Supervisor Refactoring and API Consolidation
The `op-supervisor` component underwent refactoring to streamline its operations and improve efficiency, alongside the consolidation of interop APIs for better consistency.
- The `op-supervisor`'s rewinder mechanism was refactored, removing `ChainRewoundEvent` and simplifying `rewinderDB` interactions, addressing a known issue related to rewinder's use of events ([#16556](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16556)).
- The `interop_blockRefByNumber` API was removed and consolidated into `interop_L2BlockRefByNumber` within `op-supervisor` and `op-node`, aligning with recent spec changes and reducing API redundancy ([#16636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16636)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) implementation for `op-sync-tester` was opened ([#16637](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16637)).
- A refactor of the event system within `op-service` was initiated ([#16639](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16639)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Op-Supervisor Rewinder Improvements
An issue concerning the `op-supervisor`'s rewinder mechanism was resolved, leading to a more streamlined and efficient process.
- The issue tracking the revisiting of the rewinder's use of `ChainRewoundEvent` in `op-supervisor` was closed ([#16355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16355)).

### API Consolidation
A key issue related to API redundancy within `op-node` was addressed, contributing to a cleaner and more consistent API surface.
- The issue to consolidate `interop_blockRefByNumber` and `interop_l2BlockRefByNumber` in `op-node` was closed ([#16604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16604)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Understanding Precompile Address Initialization
Discussion continued on the initialization of addresses 0x00-0xff within the op-stack.
- A user inquired about the purpose of initializing addresses 0x00-0xff with 1 wei balance and no contract code, and whether any functionalities rely on this ([#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16620)).
- The latest comment clarified that these are precompile addresses, and the 1 wei balance is a normal practice due to obscure rules governing empty accounts, ensuring they are not considered empty.
