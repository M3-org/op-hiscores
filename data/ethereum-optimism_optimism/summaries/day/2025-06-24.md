# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jun 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure with new validation scripts and acceptance test gates, alongside critical bug fixes for the op-deployer and improvements to interop monitoring and MIPS emulation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure and Validation
Significant progress was made in bolstering the testing framework. A new feature was added to extend the test validation script, enforcing consistent test structure conventions across Forge test artifacts ([#16543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16543)). Additionally, an `interop-loadtest` gate was introduced to `op-acceptance-tests` to manage the execution of load tests more efficiently ([#16564](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16564)). A dedicated EOA was also implemented for interop invalid attributes in acceptance tests to improve reliability ([#16553](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16553)).

### Critical Bug Fixes for Deployment and Challenger
Several crucial bug fixes were implemented for the `op-deployer` and `op-e2e`/`op-devstack` components. This includes fixing error messages for challenger prerequisites ([#16552](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16552)), correcting `v4.0.0` and `rc.8` artifact hashes in `op-deployer` ([#16562](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16562), [#16565](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16565)), and ensuring idempotency for `implementationsDeployment` in `op-deployer` ([#16567](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16567)).

### Improvements to Interop Monitoring and MIPS Emulation
The `op-interop-mon` was updated to emit zero values for empty metrics, preventing gauges from getting stuck at their last non-zero value and improving monitoring accuracy ([#16506](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16506)). Furthermore, the `cannon` MIPS emulator received an update to its `getrandom` syscall logic, now clearing memory reservations after updating memory, which enhances its stability ([#16529](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16529)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#16563](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16563), was opened to add `v0.4.0` support to `op-deployer`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### CI Stability and Flakiness Addressed
Efforts to investigate and improve CI flakiness have concluded with the closure of [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16271). The team has released a test flake report generator, iterated on it, and improved test flakiness, with continued monitoring planned. The spike for CI SLAs ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16437)) was also closed, with a decision not to implement CI SLAs for now, but to consider smarter ways to introduce new tests.

### Devnet and Testing Enhancements
The issue of adding the ability to run upgrade tasks against devnets in `superchain-ops` ([#15978](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15978)) has been closed. Additionally, a feature request to enable deterministic gas testing by setting a fixed base fee ([#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/408)) was closed, with the suggestion to adapt tests to query the `baseFee` instead. The porting of `TestWithdrawalsRoot` to devstack ([#412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/412)) was also closed, as it has been implemented.

### Documentation Update for Viem Bridging
The documentation issue regarding bridging ERC-20 tokens with Viem ([#1508](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1508)) has been closed, indicating that the relevant documentation updates have been completed.

## NEW ISSUES

### Conductor Alerting and Sequencer Health
A new issue, [#16558](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16558), was opened to address `op-conductor` alerting for indefinite sequencer halts. This aims to provide alerts when an active leader sequencer becomes unhealthy due to issues not impacting normal block building, such as failing rbuilder health checks.

### Interop Transaction Mempool Behavior
Issue [#16559](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16559) was opened to investigate why interop transactions with invalid attributes are sometimes not evicted from the mempool, based on observations from CI failures.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node Goroutine Stuckness
Issue [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16332) continues to be active, with users reporting `op-node` (v1.13.3) getting stuck with thousands of goroutines, primarily in `select`, `IO wait`, or `yamux` session handlers, leading to sync failures. The latest comment confirms this behavior on v1.13.3, with no resolution yet.
