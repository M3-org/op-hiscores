# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, Optimism saw significant advancements in AI-driven contract test maintenance, enhanced EL Sync testing capabilities, and critical updates to the transaction manager for improved fee estimation and stability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### AI-Powered Contract Test Maintenance System Introduced
A new AI Contract Test Maintenance System was added to reduce technical debt in contract tests. This system includes a prompt renderer to convert test ranking output into AI-ready prompts, streamlining the maintenance process.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### EL Sync Correctness: EngineController Parallelism and EL Sync Tests
Issue [#17564](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17564) discusses a synchronization issue in the `op-node`'s EL sync code path, particularly concerning `EngineController` parallelism. The issue was closed on Sep 30, 2025, with the latest comment from pcw109550 confirming that PR [#17648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17648) has been merged and tested, fixing the issue after proper locking was applied and race window amplified. The comment suggests that enabling a race detector for future implementations might be beneficial.
