# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing smart contract security with nonce-based timelock configurations, refining internal development processes, and improving testing robustness. Documentation updates and critical bug fixes for `GasPriceOracle` were also completed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Smart Contract Security and Configuration
A significant feature was added to enhance smart contract security by implementing a nonce for timelock configurations, allowing for efficient clearing of these configurations. This improves the flexibility and security of the `SaferSafes` and `TimelockGuard` contracts.
- [#17999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17999)

### Development Process and Tooling Improvements
Efforts were made to refine internal development processes, including a refactor of the commit strategy from a phase-based to a logical approach. Documentation for `opcm` releases was updated, and the `just` recipe was fixed. Additionally, verbose logging was enabled for artifact publishing scripts.
- [#18007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18007)
- [#18012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18012)
- [#18018](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18018)
- [#18015](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18015)

### Testing and Infrastructure Hardening
Testing infrastructure received attention with hardening efforts for `TestImplementations` and `cli_runner` in `op-deployer` to reduce test flakes. This involved removing parallelism and polling the Anvil environment to ensure readiness.
- [#18019](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18019)

### Critical Bug Fixes and Dependency Updates
A critical fix was cherry-picked for the `GasPriceOracle` to remove saturating math from `getOperatorFee`, addressing an issue in the `op-contracts/v5.0.0` release branch. The `op-geth` import was also updated to include Jovian timestamps in chain configurations.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Data Availability Footprint Limit Implementation
The implementation of the Data Availability (DA) footprint limit has been completed. This includes adding a DA footprint block metric and finalizing the overall implementation.

## NEW ISSUES

### Finalization Configurability for L3s
A new issue highlights the need for configurable finalization parameters, particularly for L3s, as the current hard-coded values in `op-node/rollup/finality/finalizer.go` are not optimal.
