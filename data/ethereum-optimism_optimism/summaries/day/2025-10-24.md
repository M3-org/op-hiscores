# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing smart contract security with nonce-based timelock configurations, refining internal development processes, and improving testing robustness. Documentation and artifact publishing also saw updates.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Smart Contract Security and Configuration
A significant feature was added to enhance smart contract security by implementing a nonce for timelock configurations. This allows for an O(1) operation to clear timelock configurations, improving efficiency and control over critical contract settings. This change impacts `SaferSafes.sol`, `LivenessModule2.sol`, and `TimelockGuard.sol`. ([#17999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17999))

### Developer Tooling and Testing Improvements
Efforts were made to harden the `op-deployer`'s testing suite by removing parallelism in `TestImplementations` to reduce resource contention and implementing polling in `cli_runner` to ensure the Anvil environment is ready before use. This aims to eliminate test flakes and improve reliability. ([#18019](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18019)) Additionally, the commit strategy for AI engineering prompts was refactored from a phase-based approach to a logical one, streamlining internal development processes. ([#18007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18007))

### Documentation and Release Process Updates
Documentation for releasing new `opcm` versions was updated, and the corresponding `just` recipe was fixed. This improves the clarity and accuracy of the release process for the `op-deployer`. ([#18012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18012))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Data Availability Footprint Limit Implementation
The implementation of the Data Availability (DA) footprint limit has been completed. This includes adding a DA footprint block metric and the full implementation of the DA footprint limit. The completion was contingent on the merging of a related specification derivation. ([#17501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17501), [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17551))

## NEW ISSUES

### Finalization Configurability for L3s
A new issue highlights the need for configurable finalization parameters, particularly for Layer 3 (L3) chains. The current hard-coded parameters in `op-node/rollup/finality/finalizer.go` are not suitable for L3s, which typically have different requirements than L2s. ([#18009](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18009))
