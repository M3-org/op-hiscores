# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure with new fuzz tests for `DevFeatures` and expanded acceptance tests for withdrawals. Significant progress was also made in supporting optimistic ZK games within the `op-challenger` and improving CI processes for image building and attestation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing for Core Contracts and Withdrawals
Improved test coverage for the `DevFeatures` library with new fuzz tests, enhancing the robustness of feature flag mechanisms. Additionally, acceptance tests for withdrawals were expanded to include `CANNON` and `CANNON_KONA` game types, ensuring broader compatibility and reliability across different proof systems.

- [#18374](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18374)

### Optimistic ZK Game Support and CI Improvements
The `op-challenger` now supports optimistic ZK games, with updates to the `list-games` subcommand and the introduction of independent ZK contract bindings. Concurrently, a new experimental GitHub Actions workflow was added to securely build and attest Docker images, streamlining the CI/CD pipeline.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Proofs System Documentation and Review
Several issues related to the proofs system were closed, including the review of Fusaka prestate ([#17575](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17575)) and the completion of runbook routing documentation for the proofs system ([#18372](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18372)). Additionally, governance proposal edits for U17 proofs were finalized ([#17244](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17244)).

### Challenger Tooling for ZK Games
The issue concerning `op-challenger` support for optimistic ZK games in the `list-games` subcommand was closed ([#18392](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18392)), indicating successful implementation of this feature.

### Deployment Configuration Fix
A specific issue regarding `op-deployer` reverting with custom intent for `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` was closed ([#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18407)). The resolution involved overriding `PreimageOracleChallengePeriod` to satisfy validation requirements.

## NEW ISSUES

### Contract and Feature Flag Management
New issues were opened to manage contract features, including creating a `FeatureFlag` for `OPSuccinct` ([#18419](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18419)), integrating it into `_devFeatureBitmap` ([#18420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18420)), and replacing `rollupConfigHash` with `l2ChainID` ([#18421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18421)). There's also a plan to remove the access manager ([#18418](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18418)).

### ZK Game and Prover/Challenger Enhancements
Several issues focus on improving ZK game functionality and the prover/challenger components. This includes defining sane game parameters for the Superchain ([#18423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18423)), implementing monitoring for ZK games in `dispute-mon` ([#18424](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18424)), and adding checks to ensure `SP1Verifier` compatibility with `SP1 zkVM` releases ([#18422](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18422)). Test coverage improvements are also planned for the proposer ([#18426](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18426)) and challenger ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18427)).
