# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing for `DevFeatures` with fuzz tests, expanding withdrawal acceptance tests across different game types, and initiating support for optimistic ZK games in `op-challenger`. Significant work was also done on CI for image building and attestation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing and CI/CD
Improved test coverage for `DevFeatures` contracts with new fuzz tests ([#18396](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18396)). Additionally, new acceptance tests for withdrawals were added, covering PERMISSIONED, CANNON, and CANNON_KONA game types ([#18374](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18374)). An experimental GitHub Actions workflow was introduced to build and attest Docker images securely ([#18397](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18397)).

### Optimistic ZK Game Support
The `op-challenger` tool was updated to support optimistic ZK games, including the initial build-out of OptimisticZK contract bindings and modifications to the `list-games` subcommand ([#18393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18393)).
