## NEW ISSUES
### Kona-SP1 Optimization
A new issue was opened to ensure expensive cryptographic operations in the kona-sp1 program are offloaded to the host, as the current custom EVM implementation still runs some keccak operations within the zkVM. This aims to optimize performance for the SP1 zkVM. ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18533))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Devnet Warning Clarification
Discussion on [#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1898) clarified that "failed to publish newly created block" and "invalid block signature" warnings observed when deploying a devnet using `create-l2-rollup-example` are not problematic for a local devnet. These warnings occur because the op-node attempts to publish blocks to the P2P network, but the peer does not recognize the block signature.
