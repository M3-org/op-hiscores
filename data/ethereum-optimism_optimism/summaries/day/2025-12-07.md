# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 7, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on addressing a minor error handling issue in the `op-deployer` tool and identifying a new optimization opportunity for the `kona-sp1` program. A previously reported warning in `op-node` for devnets was clarified as non-problematic.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#18532](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18532), was opened to fix an error handling bug in the `add_game_type` CLI parsing within the `op-deployer` tool.

## CLOSED ISSUES

## NEW ISSUES
### Kona-SP1 Optimization
A new issue, [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18533), was created to track the need for offloading expensive EVM operations to the host within the `kona-sp1` program. This aims to further optimize cryptographic operations for the SP1 zkVM.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Devnet Warnings Clarification
Discussion on [#1898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1898) clarified that warnings observed in `op-node` when deploying a devnet using `create-l2-rollup-example` are not problematic. The warnings, such as "failed to publish newly created block" and "invalid block signature," occur because the `op-node` attempts to publish blocks to the P2P network, but the peer does not recognize the block signature, which is expected behavior for a local devnet.
