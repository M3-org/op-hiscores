# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 14, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, fixing critical deployment issues, and progressing on the Jovian DA footprint limit. Significant work was done on op-acceptance-tests and op-deployer, alongside updates to the OPCM for v2 dispute games.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing and CI/CD Reliability
Improvements were made to the CI/CD pipeline and acceptance tests to increase stability and coverage. This included moving notifications to Slack, resolving artifact exclusion failures in scheduled runs, and adding new integration tests for `op-deployer`'s `add-game-type` functionality. Flake-shaking efforts also addressed CircleCI timeouts and infrastructure failures by tweaking default workers and resource classes.

### Critical Deployment and Upgrade Fixes
A significant bug in `op-deployer` was resolved, fixing upgrade commands that were broken due to the removal of `tag://` locator types. This involved hardcoding exact tar file GCP URLs for artifact downloads during upgrades, ensuring the deployment process remains robust.

### Progress on Jovian DA Footprint and Dispute Game V2
Work continued on the Jovian DA footprint block limit, adding configurability and integrating it with `op-geth`. Additionally, the `OPCM.deploy` function was updated to utilize v2 dispute games, deploying the `PermissionedDisputeGameV2` implementation when the v2 feature flag is active.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-dispute-mon: Fix handling of out of sync nodes
The discussion on [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814) revolves around how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes when configured with multiple rollup RPCs. The core challenge is to ensure the monitor uses the in-sync node as the source of truth rather than incorrectly flagging disagreements. A previous comment suggested that relying on the highest L2 block might be misleading if that node followed an incorrect fork. The latest comments indicate that a proposed solution (likely in a related PR) is considered better, and the issue was briefly closed before being reopened, pending the merge of the relevant PR. The discussion highlights the complexity of determining the "correct" state when nodes are out of sync and the need for robust mechanisms to identify and prioritize reliable data sources.
