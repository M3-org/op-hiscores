# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jun 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on refining documentation and internal configurations for the `op-supervisor` and `SuperchainConfig`, alongside addressing critical issues related to acceptance test reliability and supervisor-node mode renaming. New issues were opened to enhance monitoring for flashblocks and track the development of a Gas Tank contract.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No completed work was reported for Jun 11, 2025.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Three new pull requests were opened:
- **`op-supervisor` Documentation and Configuration Updates**: Two PRs were opened to improve the `op-supervisor` documentation. [#16380](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16380) fixes a typo in the `README.md`, and [#16381](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16381) adds a link to a design document.
- **Refactoring for Superchain Configuration**: [#16383](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16383) proposes to decouple `AnchorStateRegistry` from `SystemConfig` and instead utilize `SuperchainConfig`, aiming for a more modular architecture.

## NEW ISSUES

Three new issues were opened:
- **Improving Acceptance Test Reliability**: [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16378) was created to address the flakiness of acceptance tests, with the goal of making them consistently pass on the first attempt. Discussions indicate that some packages like `op-acceptance-tests/tests/interop/reorgs` pass consistently, but `op-acceptance-tests/tests/interop/sync/multisupervisor_interop` remains flaky.
- **Supervisor <> op-node Mode Renaming**: [#16379](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16379) was opened to rename supervisor-node modes to improve clarity and reduce confusion, based on a new naming convention.
- **Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerting Improvements**: [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16388) was created to establish comprehensive monitoring and alerting for flashblocks integration, particularly as op-sepolia approaches flashblocks enablement.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Gas Tank Contract**: [#836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/836) remains active, with a pull request for the Gas Tank contract (https://github.com/defi-wonderland/optimism/pull/414) being shared.
