# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, particularly for acceptance tests, and updating core dependencies for the Jovian hard fork. Significant progress was made in hardening existing tests and addressing Geth compatibility issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Acceptance Testing & Test Hardening
Significant effort was put into improving the robustness and coverage of acceptance tests. This included hardening the blob base fee calculation test, making various improvements to the Fusaka acceptance test, and adding tests for edge cases during EL Syncing. A new test was also added to handle non-zero prestate when running DeployDisputeGame.
([#17953](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17953), [#17944](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17944), [#18001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18001), [#18057](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18057))

### Jovian Hard Fork Preparations & Dependency Updates
Updates were made to align with the upcoming Jovian hard fork. This involved updating the `op-geth` dependency to reflect Jovian timestamps and receipt changes, and adjusting accelerated precompile input limits for Jovian in `op-program`.
([#18048](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18048), [#18046](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18046), [#18042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18042))

### Infrastructure and Tooling Improvements
Several infrastructure and tooling enhancements were implemented. This included fixing a test due to a Geth breakage, aligning the fake beacon mock with post-Fulu L1 CL behavior, and giving more time for L2 to include bridge transactions in `op-devstack`. The `sysext` address configuration was also corrected, and the default Cannon VM version was updated to version 8.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Cannon Version and Beacon Node Updates
Support for Cannon version 7 has been dropped, following the approval and shipment of version 8 to production ([#17177](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17177)). Additionally, the mocked beacon node in testing environments has been updated to reflect post-Fusaka L1 CL behavior, where valid blob proofs are no longer returned with sidecars ([#17727](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17727)).

### Documentation and Flashblocks Issues Resolved
Several documentation issues were addressed, including broken internal links in tutorials ([#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1802)) and an issue related to `op-up` installation instructions ([#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1797)). The 30-second timeout issue on the Flashblocks websocket URL, caused by Cloudflare<>GCP interference, has also been resolved ([#17858](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17858)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Proofs and VM Runner Updates
A new issue tracks the progress for proofs, including tagging `op-program` release candidates, adding prestate to the verified prestates file, and updating the VM runner ([#18058](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18058)).

### `op-devstack` Reliability and Flakiness
Several new issues highlight concerns with `op-devstack` reliability. These include auditing and removing problematic retries and timeouts that cause flakes ([#18061](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18061)), tracking and fixing root causes of acceptance test flakiness ([#18060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18060)), and resolving race conditions arising from `dsl.EOA` abuse ([#18063](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18063)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-batcher` AltDA Max Frame Size
Issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17796) discusses a bug where `op-batcher`'s max frame size is limited by the altDA max input size in generic commitment mode, contrary to specifications. The latest comment from sebastianst suggests that a fix developed by Celestia, which is quite trivial, should be opened as a PR.

### Upstreaming Celestia Batcher DA Size Fix
Issue [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17872) is investigating upstreaming a fix from Celestia for the `op-batcher` altDA size issue. The latest comment from sebastianst confirms that the Celestia fix has been reviewed, looks good, and a PR has been requested from them.
