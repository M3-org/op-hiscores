# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, particularly for acceptance tests, alongside critical updates for the Jovian hard fork and Cannon VM. Significant effort was also directed towards improving the reliability and robustness of the development environment.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Acceptance Testing & Devstack Reliability
Improvements were made to acceptance tests, including hardening blob base fee calculations and various enhancements to the Fusaka test suite. Efforts also focused on addressing edge cases in EL Syncing and ensuring non-zero prestate for dispute game deployments. The devstack was updated to allow more time for L2 bridge transactions and to correctly populate address configurations, reducing timeouts and flakiness.

### Jovian Hard Fork & Cannon VM Updates
Critical updates were implemented for the Jovian hard fork, including new accelerated precompile input limits and updates to the `op-geth` dependency to reflect Jovian timestamps and receipt changes. The Cannon VM was updated to default to version 8, targeting Go 1.24, and the mock beacon node was aligned with post-Fulu L1 CL behavior.

### Test Fixes and Infrastructure Improvements
A bug fix was implemented for acceptance tests due to a `geth` breakage related to `params.HistoryServeWindow`. Test ETH amounts were reduced to be smaller, and the `ctb` script was updated to skip blueprint Dispute Game implementation verification when `DEPLOY_V2_DISPUTE_GAMES` is enabled. A new U17 audit report was added to the documentation.

## NEW ISSUES

### Devstack Reliability and Test Flakiness
New issues have been opened to address the root causes of acceptance test flakiness in `op-devstack`. This includes auditing and removing problematic retries and timeouts, and resolving race conditions arising from `dsl.EOA` abuse, where multiple tests might be using the same account concurrently.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher [altda] max frame size ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17796))
The discussion centers on exempting `op-batcher` max frame size from altDA max input size limits in generic commitment mode, as per Optimism specs. A commit from Celestia's fork of Optimism was identified as a potential fix, and a PR was requested to merge it.

### Investigate upstreaming Celestia batcher DA size fix ([#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17872))
This issue is a follow-up to [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17796), specifically investigating upstreaming a fix from Celestia for the `op-batcher` DA size. A PR has been opened to address this, noting the fix was trivial.

### [2024 Q4 Audit] [page-path] ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1789))
This issue, related to internal OP Labs audit tasks, was closed with a reference to PR #1802.

### Issue on docs ([#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1797))
The issue reported a problem with the `op-up` install script on the `/get-started/interop` path. It was closed with a comment asking for more context if available.

### Issue on docs: some internal links in tutorials are broken ([#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1802))
This issue highlighted broken internal links in the documentation, specifically in the `/chain-operators/tutorials/create-l2-rollup/` path. The issue was closed, with a maintainer acknowledging the problem due to a platform switch and inviting the reporter to contribute small PRs to fix other broken links identified by the Mintlify linter.
