# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the `op-batcher`'s throttling behavior, improving contract assertions, and addressing test suite stability. Key updates include enhanced visibility for batcher throttling and a fix for the OPCM test suite.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Batcher Throttling and Data Handling Improvements
The `op-batcher` received significant updates to its throttling mechanism. A new feature ([#16804](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16804)) makes the maximum throttle threshold more visible in logs and API, improving operational transparency. Additionally, the batcher was updated to always use blobs while throttling ([#16773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16773)), preventing unintended fallback to calldata during periods of high data backlog.

### Contract Assertion Cleanup and Test Fixes
Efforts were made to clean up assertions across various Bedrock contracts, including the Optimism Portal, OPCM, ASR, and EthLockbox ([#16819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16819)). This refactoring aims to improve code clarity and maintainability. A specific bug fix was also implemented for the OPCM test suite ([#16813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16813)), ensuring its reliability.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Batcher Throttling Behavior Resolved
The issue concerning the `op-batcher` preventing auto-DA switching to calldata if throttling is activated ([#16691](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16691)) has been closed. This indicates that the batcher's behavior during throttling, specifically its preference for blobs, has been successfully addressed.

### Supervisor and Node Reset Logic
The issue related to improving the reset unsafe target logic in `op-supervisor` and `op-node` ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16314)) has been closed. The latest comment indicates that the issue is being closed due to recent project changes, with a suggestion to re-open or create a new issue if necessary. Previous discussions highlighted partial implementation and remaining considerations for pre- and post-Interop handling.

### Logger Utility Refinement
The issue regarding a more reusable logger utility to change the log-level of sub-loggers in `op-service` ([#15139](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15139)) has been closed. The resolution points to the existing mechanism for adjusting log levels based on context data via the log handler method, which is already supported by devstack.

## NEW ISSUES

### OPCM Test Suite Failure Investigation
A new issue has been opened to investigate why the `OPContractsManager_Upgrade_Test::test_verifyOpcmCorrectness_succeeds()` test fails specifically on the OP Mainnet upgrade test but not on other fork tests ([#16823](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16823)).

### Geth v1.16.1 Merge Completion
A new issue has been created to track the completion of the Geth v1.16.1 merge ([#16825](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16825)). This issue lists the relevant open pull requests for this merge.
