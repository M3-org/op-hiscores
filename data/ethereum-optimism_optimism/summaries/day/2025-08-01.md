## NEW ISSUES
A new issue was opened today:
- **Mempool Rebroadcaster Deployment**: [#16932](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16932) was created to track the deployment of a mempool rebroadcaster cronjob. This is in response to observations from Base regarding transactions being rejected by the `rbuilder` mempool while accepted by `geth`, leading to potential mempool drifts.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **[Tracking] Min Base Fee**: Discussion continued on [#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16807), which tracks the Min Base Fee feature. A new comment from wlawt on August 1st, 2025, at 15:46:47Z, added an early reth draft for review: `https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/17704`.
- **min-base-fee: write specification**: On [#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/742), which focuses on writing the specification for the min-base-fee, geoknee commented on August 1st, 2025, at 21:26:38Z, stating the need to compute a rough estimate for the state growth implied by this feature to include in the motivation section of the specs.
