# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jun 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing test suite reliability and expanding deployment capabilities. Key achievements include aligning test contracts with new validation rules, adding end-to-end bootstrap tests for `op-deployer`, and implementing an API for the `op-supervisor`'s Failsafe mode.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Test Suite Refinements and Compliance
Significant effort was directed towards improving the robustness and compliance of the test suite. This involved updating several test files to align with new validation script rules, ensuring consistency in contract naming conventions, and reducing the exclusion list for test validation.
- [#16561](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16561)
- [#16590](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16590)

### Enhanced Deployment and Bootstrap Testing
The `op-deployer` received new end-to-end tests for bootstrapping the Superchain and its implementations. These tests validate deployments using `apply` against both local and tagged artifacts, improving the reliability of the deployment process. Additionally, support for custom OPCM was integrated, reimplementing RPC calls in Go for compatibility with older `op-contracts` versions.
- [#16575](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16575)
- [#16546](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16546)

### Supervisor API for Failsafe Mode
A new API was introduced for the `op-supervisor` to support Failsafe mode, a component of the AutoStop feature. This API allows for getting and setting admin access, utilizing an atomic boolean to short-circuit `CheckAccessList` and return an `ErrAutoStop` when Failsafe is active.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A dependency update was initiated to bump `github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub` from version `0.12.0` to `0.14.1` ([#16592](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16592)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Operations and Task Management Improvements
Several issues related to Superchain operations and task management were closed, indicating significant progress in streamlining these processes. This includes the implementation of stacked simulations for automatically running tasks in CI ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/337), [#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/342)), improvements to the OPCM Migrate Script ([#16326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16326)), and enhancements to `SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER` functionality ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/448)).

### Documentation and Path Updates
Documentation and path-related issues were resolved, ensuring accuracy and consistency across the repository. This includes updating paths in improvement documents ([#548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/548)), updating task paths for mainnet tasks ([#600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/600)), and updating `Fetch-Task` to use the mainnet task directory ([#547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/547)).

### Template and Validation System Enhancements
Improvements to the template and validation systems were completed, leading to more robust and efficient development workflows. This involved ensuring templates check against `StandardValidator` contracts ([#838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/838)), making prevalidations possible regardless of address registry availability ([#654](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/654)), and checking domain hash from simulation against `VALIDATIONS.md` entries ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/679)).

### Refactoring and UX Improvements
Refactoring efforts and user experience enhancements were finalized. This includes addressing the `StateOverrideManager` always adding nonce as a state override ([#814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/814)), providing a simple UX for users to override Nonces ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/770)), and improving the granularity of `addresses.json` checking ([#753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/753)).

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-deployer` and Acceptance Test Queries
New issues have been opened concerning the `op-deployer` and acceptance tests. One question asks why `ChainState.ID` is a hash in `op-deployer` ([#16586](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16586)), while another proposes using block times for waits/timeouts instead of hardcoded values in acceptance tests ([#16598](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16598)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### GoReleaser for OP Stack Release Pipeline ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16097))
Discussion continues on using GoReleaser for the `op-node/batcher/proposer/challenger` release pipeline. A recent comment suggests wiring up `op-workbench` to automatically execute `git cliff` commands for generating release notes and pushing them to GitHub, aiming for a one-click solution for high-quality changelogs. Previous comments highlighted the need to consolidate build systems (docker bake, makefiles, justfiles) into a single, consistent approach before adopting GoReleaser to avoid further bloat and inconsistencies. The `op-deployer`'s current GoReleaser setup is noted as not being a good example due to existing inconsistencies.

### Abnormal CPU Usage with Latest `op-geth` ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/613))
The issue of abnormal CPU usage with `op-geth` v1.101511.0 is still active. A user shared a `pprof` file, noting that the performance issue was due to an index update that took about 24 hours. Another user provided detailed instructions on how to capture `pprof` metrics, suggesting that the high CPU usage might be temporary due to log indexing rebuilds in the backported go-ethereum v1.15.11. There's a concern that the problem persists even after index upgrades, indicating a potential bug.

### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/399))
The distinction between Supersim and Interop Kurtosis Devnet is being clarified. It was explained that Supersim is a local tool for testing multichain/interop applications, acting as a wrapper around Anvil, and is lighter for local development. It's used by applications planning to launch when interop is live on mainnet. A recent question asks if Supersim is mainly for testing dapps rather than chains, which Kurtosis handles.
