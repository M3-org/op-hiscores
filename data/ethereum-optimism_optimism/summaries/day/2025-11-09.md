# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on refactoring how L2 forks are required within the `op-devstack`, impacting various acceptance tests across different fork versions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### L2 Fork Requirement Refactoring
A significant refactoring effort was completed to streamline how L2 forks are required within the `op-devstack`. This change impacts numerous acceptance tests across Ecotone, Fjord, Isthmus, and Jovian forks, improving the underlying structure for managing L2 network configurations.

### Auditing Retries and Timeouts in op-devstack
Discussion on [#18061](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18061) highlights concerns about hard-coded retry counts in `dsl.EOA.Plan` as a common source of test flakes. A potential solution involves using a `txinclude.Includer` to ensure submitted transactions are included in the unsafe chain, which would make `txplan.PlannedTx.Submitted` and `txplan.PlannedTx.Included` effectively the same. This approach, however, introduces a "footgun" for tests that need to submit but not include transactions, suggesting a separate `PlanFailure` method might be necessary.
