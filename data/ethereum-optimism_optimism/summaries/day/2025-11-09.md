# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on refining the `op-devstack` and `op-acceptance-tests` components, with several new pull requests opened to improve testing infrastructure and address flakiness in Ecotone fee tests.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No completed work to report for this period.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Four new pull requests were opened today, primarily focusing on testing and development environment improvements. These include enhancements to `op-devstack` for adding an archive matcher and refactoring L2 fork requirements ([#18227](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18227), [#18226](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18226)). Additionally, efforts were made to improve the reliability of `op-acceptance-tests` by ensuring Ecotone fees tests run only on compatible networks and de-flakifying Ecotone fee tests by reading balances from specific blocks ([#18225](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18225), [#18224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18224)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Auditing Retries and Timeouts in `op-devstack`
Discussion on [#18061](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18061) highlights concerns about hard-coded retry counts in `dsl.EOA.Plan` as a common source of test flakiness. A potential solution involves using a `txinclude.Includer` to ensure submitted transactions are included in the unsafe chain, which would make `txplan.PlannedTx.Submitted` and `txplan.PlannedTx.Included` effectively the same. This approach, however, introduces a "footgun" for tests that only want to submit a transaction without inclusion, suggesting a separate `PlanFailure` method might be needed.
