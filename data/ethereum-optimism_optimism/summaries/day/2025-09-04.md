# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day focused on enhancing testing infrastructure with significant updates to acceptance tests, unifying them into a single workflow and adding more system-level tests. An issue related to `op-node/p2p/gossip` configuration was actively discussed, and a long-standing issue regarding `op-geth` initialization was closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Acceptance Test Infrastructure
Significant progress was made in streamlining the acceptance testing framework. All acceptance tests are now being moved into a single workflow, improving efficiency and organization. This involved stopping the execution of acceptance tests as unit tests in other workflows and adding a substantial number of new system-level acceptance tests.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Workflow Unification
A key initiative to consolidate all acceptance tests into a single workflow was completed. This resolves the long-standing goal of centralizing acceptance test execution, moving them out of other workflows like 'go tests' in the 'main' workflow.

### `op-geth` Initialization Error Resolution
An issue where `op-geth init` would give a "head block is not reachable" error was closed. Recent comments indicate that this error might not be critical and setup can proceed, with some users confirming they encountered and bypassed it successfully.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node/p2p/gossip` Configuration Overwrites
Discussion continued on [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17308) regarding `ConfigureGossip` overwriting sane defaults with zero values. The core of the problem lies in `P2PConfig` values like `MeshDHi` defaulting to 0 when unset, which can lead to invalid configurations and panics in `go-libp2p-pubsub`. The latest comments from `wood-jp` and `ajsutton` explore potential solutions. `wood-jp` explained that the issue arose from a dependency update (`go-libp2p-pubsub v0.12.0 => v0.14.2`) exposing a panic due to invalid `Dhi` and `Dscore` values (0 and 4 respectively). `ajsutton` suggested adding a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to return a fully filled, valid configuration with sensible defaults, allowing tests to modify only necessary options. `wood-jp` acknowledged this but expressed a preference for the current PR's approach, noting that `DefaultP2PConfig` might require future developers to be aware of its existence.
