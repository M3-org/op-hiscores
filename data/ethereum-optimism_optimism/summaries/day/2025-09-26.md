# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing contract features, fixing critical bugs in contract tests and transaction handling, and improving testing infrastructure. Key updates include new dispute game flags, a fix for acceptance job memory usage, and updates for Fusaka compatibility.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Contract Enhancements & Feature Flags
New development feature flags, `CANNON_KONA` and `DEPLOY_V2_DISPUTE_GAMES`, were added to the bedrock contracts test matrix to support future dispute game functionalities ([#17635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17635)). Additionally, a basic rules file for Diamond was introduced, establishing a starting point for style guidelines ([#17640](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17640)).

### Bug Fixes in Testing and Transaction Management
Critical bug fixes were implemented to optimize the testing pipeline and ensure correct transaction behavior. The acceptance job now skips building contract tests, reducing memory usage and speeding up execution ([#17639](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17639)). A fix was also applied to the `auth minter` helper and `_mint` binding in `depositTransaction` tests ([#17642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17642)). Furthermore, the `txmgr` was updated to allow blobs to be sent with Fusaka-compatible cell proofs by configuration, addressing a key requirement for Fusaka activation on L2 ([#17620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17620)).

### Testing Infrastructure Improvements
Several updates were made to enhance the robustness and reliability of the testing suite. A new test was added for popping the same element in `op-node/rollup/clsync` ([#17608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17608)). The `op-acceptor` was updated to version `v3.4.2` ([#17623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17623)), and the `op-sync-tester` now retries block fetching when processing `newPayload` to prevent flakiness in `TestSyncTesterELSync` ([#17624](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17624)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#17626](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17626), was opened to remove `check-{canyon,delta,ecotone,fjord}` commands from `op-chain-ops`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fusaka Compatibility and Testing Flakiness Resolved
The issue of `op-batcher` preparing for Fusaka activation, specifically sending blob transactions with cell proofs, has been resolved ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17472)). Additionally, the root cause of `TestSyncTesterELSync` failures in `op-acceptance-tests` has been identified and addressed ([#17615](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17615)).

### Contract Test Consolidation
The `L2ToL1MessagePasser` tests have been merged using `DevFeatures`, allowing for better organization and maintenance of contract tests ([#17597](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17597)).

## NEW ISSUES

### L2CL and L2EL Synchronization Challenges
New issues have been opened to investigate the conditions for L2EL to start EL Syncing, particularly concerning `op-geth` with `op-sepolia` ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17628)). Further challenges include ensuring the verifier syncs to the tip of the chain, reaching the unsafe head through L1 reads and advancing safe heads ([#17629](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17629)).

### Sequencer and EL Sync Mode
An issue has been raised to understand why the sequencer cannot advance blocks when in EL Sync mode and to consolidate `sync.CLSync` and `sync.ELSync` modes ([#17630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17630)).

### EL Sync Testing with Multiple Implementations
A need has been identified to validate L2CL by mimicking multiple L2EL implementations for initial EL Sync, especially concerning different network behaviors and engine API responses ([#17632](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17632)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### L2CL<>L2EL: Find out condition of L2EL for starting EL Syncing ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17628))
The discussion revolves around the conditions under which an Execution Layer (EL) client can initiate syncing, particularly for `op-geth` on `op-sepolia`. While the initial confusion about triggering snap-sync twice has been clarified, the consensus is that the EL client should simply sync, regardless of the specific mechanism (snap-sync or full block execution via p2p). The latest comment suggests that this issue might be handled by `engineController.insertUnsafePayload` and could potentially be closed, as the focus for removing `ReqRes` sync may shift to EL Syncs after the initial run. The key takeaway is that the EL client's prerequisites for backfilling should primarily be p2p connections to other nodes and receiving a `FCU` call to set new sync targets.
