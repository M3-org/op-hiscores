# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 1, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing contract security with strict pragma checks, expanding OPCMv2 tests, and improving CI/CD workflows. Significant progress was also made in op-batcher stability and op-supernode API activity.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Contract Security and Testing Enhancements
- Added a new check to ensure all source contracts use strict pragmas, improving contract security and consistency ([#18390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18390)).
- Expanded OPCMv2 tests to cover existing behaviors for `AddGameType` and `UpdatePrestate`, and added tests for `OPContracts` ([#18389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18389)).

### Infrastructure and CI/CD Improvements
- Fixed a bug in `op-batcher` related to max channel duration tracking for large block backlogs ([#18344](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18344)).
- Resolved CI failures and integrated Openchain import for better error signature tracking ([#18450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18450), [#18447](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18447)).
- Split the CI bake workflow into protected and unprotected flows to enhance security and reduce container registry usage ([#18443](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18443)).

### Supernode and Light Client Development
- Introduced `superroot_atTimestamp` as a modular component of `op-supernode` to enhance API activity ([#18180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18180)).
- Implemented logic for disabling derivation in the `op-node` Light CL, building on previous work ([#18290](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18290)).
- Added subprocess flashblocks support to `sysgo` for improved testing capabilities ([#18318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18318)).

### Dispute Game Refactoring
- Moved `GameType` to a more general `game/type` package in `op-challenger` to better accommodate ZK games and improve code separation ([#18432](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18432)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **OPCMv2 and Contract Features**: Several PRs focus on OPCMv2, including upgrade allowances ([#18462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18462)), adding CGT ([#18455](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18455)), breaking out helper contracts ([#18454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18454)), and modifying Solidity scripts with branching logic ([#18458](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18458)). A script for deploying safersafes was also opened ([#18448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18448)).
- **Dependency and Tooling Updates**: Dependabot PRs were opened to bump `github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter` ([#18460](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18460)) and `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace` ([#18459](https://github.com/ethereum.com/optimism/pull/18459)).
- **Challenger and Interop Filter Development**: New PRs introduce a service skeleton for `op-interop-filter` ([#18456](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18456)), and in `op-challenger`, work on challenging invalid ZK games ([#18442](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18442)) and introducing a generic player ([#18441](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18441)).
- **Testing and Kona Support**: Updates include adding kona-healthcheck support to conductor ([#18453](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18453)) and updating succinct tests to follow conventions ([#18452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18452)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Contract Interface and OPCM Address Finalization
- The tracker for EVM Engineering contract interface improvements has been closed, indicating progress in improving developer experience and compile times ([#11733](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/11733)).
- The issue to replace the Upgrade 14 OPCM address in tests, once finalized, has been closed, signifying the completion of this update ([#14665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14665)).

### Light Client and Derivation Control
- The milestone issue for `op-node` Light CL to disable derivation has been closed, confirming the successful implementation of the `--l2.unsafe-only` flag ([#18316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18316)).

### ZK Game Challenging Strategy
- The spike issue to decide how to support challenging ZK games has been closed, with the decision made to integrate ZK game challenging into `op-challenger` ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18322)).

### Kona Prestate Builder Configuration
- The issue regarding adding custom config support to the Kona prestate builder has been closed, indicating that this functionality is now available ([#18449](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18449)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Kona Integration and Testing
- A new issue highlights the need to integrate `op-succinct` changes into Kona ([#18457](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18457)).
- Unit tests are required for the `OPSuccinctFaultDisputeGame` contract to verify ZK-based fault dispute game logic ([#18461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18461)).

### OP-Supernode Healthcheck Support
- An issue has been opened to modify OP-Supernode Charts to support healthchecks on `/<chain-id>/` subdomains, as current healthchecks are not functioning with these subdomains ([#18451](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18451)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### SuperchainConfig Type Porting
- The issue to port the `SuperchainConfig` type from `superchain-registry` ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/741)) remains active. Recent comments indicate progress on adding documentation for the `SuperchainDefinition` type to the specs, with a PR opened for review. There was a clarification regarding the notation, emphasizing it should not be Go syntax.
