# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 1, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing contract security with strict pragma checks, improving OPCMv2 testing, and fixing batcher issues. Significant work was also done on CI/CD pipelines, op-supernode API activity, and light CL derivation logic.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Contract Security and Testing Enhancements
New checks were added to enforce strict pragma usage in contracts, improving security standards ([#18390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18390)). Comprehensive tests for OPCMv2's `AddGameType` and `UpdatePrestate` behaviors, as well as `OPContracts`, were introduced to ensure robustness ([#18389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18389)).

### Batcher and CI/CD Improvements
A critical bug affecting max channel duration tracking for large block backlogs in the op-batcher was fixed ([#18344](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18344)). CI stability was addressed with a general fix ([#18450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18450)), and the CI workflow was split into protected/unprotected flows to enhance security and optimize container registry usage ([#18443](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18443)). Openchain import support was also added to CI for better error signature tracking ([#18447](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18447)).

### Supernode and Node Functionality
The `superroot_atTimestamp` API activity was introduced as a modular component of `op-supernode` ([#18180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18180)). Logic for disabling derivation in `op-node` for light CL was implemented ([#18290](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18290)). Subprocess flashblocks support was added to `sysgo` ([#18318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18318)).

### Challenger Game Type Refactoring
The `GameType` was moved to a more general `game/type` package from `game/fault/type` in `op-challenger` to better accommodate future ZK games and improve code separation ([#18432](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18432)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Contract and OPCM Improvements
Issues related to contract interface improvements and the replacement of a temporary OPCM address in tests were closed, indicating progress in refining contract development and testing practices ([#11733](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/11733), [#14665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14665)).

### Node Derivation and ZK Game Support
The issue concerning disabling derivation in `op-node` for light CL was closed, signifying the successful implementation of the `--l2.unsafe-only` flag ([#18316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18316)). A spike to decide on supporting ZK games was also closed, with the decision made to support them within `op-challenger` ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18322)).

### Kona Prestate Builder Configuration
The issue regarding adding custom config support to the Kona prestate builder was closed, indicating that this functionality has been addressed ([#18449](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18449)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Kona and Supernode Configuration
New issues include adding custom configuration support to the Kona prestate builder ([#18449](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18449)) and modifying OP-Supernode Charts to support healthchecks on chain-id subdomains ([#18451](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18451)).

### ZK Game Integration
Integration of `op-succinct` changes into Kona is a new priority ([#18457](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18457)), along with adding unit tests for the `OPSuccinctFaultDisputeGame` contract to verify ZK-based fault dispute game logic ([#18461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18461)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### SuperchainConfig Type Porting
Discussion on [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/741) revolves around porting the `SuperchainConfig` type from the `superchain-registry` to the specs. Recent comments indicate that a PR ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/867)) has been opened to address this, with a focus on ensuring the notation in the specs aligns with existing type definitions rather than Go syntax. The initial proposed documentation for `SuperchainDefinition` has been reviewed and is being refined to match the required format.
