## CLOSED ISSUES
### Precompile Address Initialization Clarification
Issue [#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16620), which questioned the purpose of initializing addresses 0x00-0xff with 1 wei balance and no contract code in the op-stack, was closed. The discussion clarified that these are precompile addresses, and the 1 wei balance is standard practice due to rules governing empty accounts.
