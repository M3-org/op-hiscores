# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing smart contract security with IERC165 support for SaferSafes, critical bug fixes in op-node and CI/CD pipelines, and significant improvements to dispute game contract management.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Smart Contract Security and Management
Significant progress was made in smart contract security and management. IERC165 support was added to SaferSafes, improving contract introspection and compatibility [#17864](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17864). The `TimelockGuard` was enhanced to require `msgSender` to be an owner of the Safe for transaction execution, bolstering security [#17900](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17900). Additionally, the `OPContractsManager` now supports V2 contracts in `addGameType` and updates the upgrade method for `disputegame-v2`, enabling creator patterns for dispute game implementations [#17782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17782), [#17874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17874).

### Core Protocol Stability and Performance
Several critical fixes and improvements were implemented to enhance core protocol stability. A bug in `op-node` was resolved to correctly validate Jovian blocks with non-zero `blobGasUsed` values [#17940](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17940). The `GasPriceOracle` was updated to remove saturating math from `getOperatorFee` for Isthmus and Jovian, addressing previous issues [#17913](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17913). The beacon client in `op-service` was made more robust [#17866](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17866), and async block processing timing logs were revived in `op-node` for better performance visibility [#17915](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17915).

### CI/CD and Testing Infrastructure Improvements
The CI/CD pipeline and testing infrastructure received several updates. Incorrect format strings in the `ManageDrippie` script were fixed [#17717](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17717). Cache paths were updated and saving was ensured in CircleCI configurations [#17968](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17968), and `op-deployer` now uses a temporary cache directory for CLI tests to prevent excessive storage usage [#17965](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17965). Furthermore, `op-deployer` caches are now cleaned up after every test to prevent disk usage issues on self-hosted runners [#17959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17959). Test coverage for `SaferSafes` was improved by converting tests to fuzz tests and adding comprehensive coverage for `checkAfterExecution` [#17949](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17949).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Nine new pull requests were opened today. These include updates for Jovian upgrade transactions [#17971](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17971), adding `op-supernode` for publication [#17970](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17970), and promoting stable tests from the `flake-shake` gate [#17969](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17969). Documentation for runtime batcher flushing was added to `op-batcher` [#17967](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17967). Other PRs focus on L2EL Engine API support for `op-reth` in `op-devstack` [#17964](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17964), upgrading Gnosis Safe libraries to 1.4.1 [#17962](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17962), and dropping span batches with singular batch extraction errors in derive [#17961](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17961). `op-challenger` now supports retrieving the oracle and prestate via game arguments [#17958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17958), and contract codeowners were updated to adjust reviewer rules for markdown-only changes [#17957](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17957).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dispute Game Contract Upgrades
Two issues related to the use of V2 dispute game implementations in `OPContractsManager` were closed today. This includes using V2 dispute game implementations in `OPCM.upgrade` [#17258](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17258) and using V2 dispute game contracts in `OPCM.addGameType` [#17260](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17260). Both functionalities are now feature-flagged.

### Operator Fee and Gas Price Oracle Fixes
Issues concerning the `GasPriceOracle` and operator fees were resolved. Stronger tests for edge cases in the Jovian/operator-fee-fix/GPO were added [#17887](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17887), and the saturating math issue in the `operatorFee` getter was revisited and addressed [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17888).

### Miscellaneous Closures
Other closed issues include a request to record a demo [#17557](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17557) and a task to implement `snapman` for reth snapshots of full nodes [#17684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17684).

## NEW ISSUES

### Flaky Tests and Feature Flags
A new flaky test was reported: `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` [#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17966). Additionally, an issue was opened to remove feature toggles for Jovian now that the hardfork scope is settled [#17960](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17960).

### Build Environment Issues
An `Optimism mise install` error was reported due to a version prefix "v" causing issues with URL formatting during dependency retrieval [#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17963).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fusaka Preparation for op-geth [#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/682)
The discussion on preparing `op-geth` for Fusaka continues. It was confirmed that the Sepolia merge is complete, but the Mainnet merge is still pending. The latest comment from @geoknee on 2025-10-21T11:04:29Z clarifies that while Sepolia is done, Mainnet is not.

### Fusaka-Defense: Superchain-ops Task for Updating Absolute Prestate [#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1206)
This issue tracks the task of updating the absolute prestate for Fusaka activation. The task has been executed on Sepolia. @geoknee's latest comment on 2025-10-21T14:54:09Z asks if the ticket should remain open to track the Mainnet task, indicating ongoing work for the Mainnet deployment. Previous discussions confirmed the template for drafting the task could still be used.
