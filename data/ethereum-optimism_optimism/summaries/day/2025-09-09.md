# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes across the op-program, op-devstack, and contracts-bedrock, alongside significant enhancements to acceptance tests with real-world data from OP Sepolia. Documentation for contract style guidelines was also improved.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Bug Fixes and Environment Updates
Several critical bug fixes were implemented, including resolving a version loop issue in `op-program` to correctly handle tags with spaces ([#17360](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17360)). The `op-devstack` environment for Kona was updated to reflect changes in log level and format ([#17370](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17370)). Additionally, the StandardValidator version was bumped on the `develop` branch to incorporate new changes ([#17378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17378)).

### Enhanced Acceptance Testing for Persistent Devnets
Significant improvements were made to `op-acceptance-tests` to ensure tests wait for fund balances in persistent devnets, addressing potential issues where balances might not be immediately present ([#17397](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17397)). New upgrade tests for `op-node` were also added, utilizing `op-sync-tester` and real-world data from OP Sepolia to validate hardforks and syncing capabilities ([#17363](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17363)).

### Contracts and Tooling Improvements
The Standard Validator's versioning mechanism was improved to retrieve implementation versions directly from the contracts, reducing bytecode size ([#17377](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17377)). Support for `common.Hash` was added to `op-service/cliutil` ([#17391](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17391)), and `op-up` now encodes version information directly into its binary ([#17405](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17405)).

### Documentation and Style Guide Updates
The documentation for `contracts-bedrock` was enhanced with new guidelines and style examples for interface inheritance, including spacers, immutables, events, and named variables ([#17339](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17339)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Sync Tester Milestones Achieved
The issue tracking the addition of sync acceptance tests using the sync tester ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16703)) has been closed, marking the completion of the first milestone for the sync-tester. This involved testing each HF transition and validating multiple CLs syncing together.

### Sequencer Configuration Updates
Several issues related to sequencer configuration in mainnet were closed. This includes the creation of a new sequencer with flashblocks ([#17318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17318)) and the removal of `prod-mainnet-sequencer-0` as a voter ([#17319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17319)), both completed via associated PRs in the `k8s` repository.

### DA Footprint Limit Productionization
The issue concerning the productionization of the DA Footprint Limit hackathon work ([#16999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16999)) has been closed.

### Acceptance Test Failures on Eris Devnet
A specific issue regarding `TestL1ToL2Deposit` failing on the Eris devnet ([#17384](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17384)) was identified and subsequently closed on the same day.

## NEW ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Failures on Eris Devnet
Multiple acceptance tests are failing on the Eris devnet, including `TestERC20Bridge` ([#17385](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17385)), `TestFees` ([#17386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17386)), and `TestOperatorFeeDevstack` ([#17387](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17387)). These failures are being investigated.

### DA Footprint Limit Enhancements
New issues have been opened to ratify the design for the DA footprint block limit ([#17394](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17394)) and to add unit tests for the DA Footprint Limit in `op-geth` ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17395)). The unit tests aim to verify `gasUsed` changes based on `da_footprint_gas_scalar`.

### OP Stack Component Versioning and Sync Testing
A new issue highlights the difficulty in easily obtaining the latest version numbers for OP Stack components ([#17396](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17396)). Additionally, support for EL Sync Testing in `op-sync-tester` has been proposed ([#17388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17388)) to ensure correct functioning as the project moves away from req-resp p2p sync.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerting Improvements ([#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16388))
Progress has been made on flashblocks monitoring and alerting. A monitoring dashboard has been completed, and related alerting PRs have been raised. Discussions include defining key metrics like peer count, block progression SLAs, pending transaction thresholds, and flashblocks-specific metrics such as `reth_op_rbuilder_total_block_built_duration`. The absence of certain metrics should also trigger alerts.

### Exposing More Networks in CI Box for Sync Tester ([#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/454))
The discussion revolves around exposing L2 ELs and L1 beacon APIs in CI for various networks (mainnet, sepolia, base, unichain, ink) to facilitate `op-sync-tester`'s ability to test with real chain data. Mainnet L2 RPCs are available, and the L1 beacon API for ETH Mainnet is being addressed. The issue is largely considered done, with some refactoring planned for daily tests.

### Acceptance Tests in Persistent Devnets ([#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/398))
While significant progress has been made in running acceptance tests in persistent devnets, some tests are still failing on Eris. New tickets have been created to follow up on specific failing tests like `TestERC20Bridge` and `TestOperatorFeeDevstack`. L1 Faucet support was previously added to aid in this effort.
