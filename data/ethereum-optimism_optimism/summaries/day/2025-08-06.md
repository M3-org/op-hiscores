### Project Flagging for OP Allocation
Issue [#72](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/72), titled "Onchain Builders: Project got flagged inappropriately," was opened to address concerns about a project being incorrectly flagged during the OP allocation process. The user "sexychinese" reported that their project, "World Mini Apps," which includes multiple mini-apps, was flagged. The Optimism team, specifically "ccerv1," acknowledged the issue and confirmed they were investigating. The issue was subsequently resolved, with "ccerv1" stating, "Issue has been resolved: #73."
