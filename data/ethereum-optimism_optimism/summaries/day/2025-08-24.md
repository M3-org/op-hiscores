# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Aug 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on optimizing cannon's logging frequency for long-running processes and refining documentation for command-line examples. A new interop POC implementation issue was opened, and discussions continued on monitoring improvements for flashblocks.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Cannon Performance and Logging Optimization
A significant feature was added to reduce excessive logging during long-running cannon fault proof executions. The default progress logging frequency has been decreased from every 100,000 steps to every 1,000,000 steps, which will lead to fewer logs and improved performance for these processes. ([#17186](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17186))

### Documentation and Command-Line Clarity
An update was made to the `op-node` README to ensure proper line continuation with backslashes in command-line examples. This fix addresses potential copy-paste issues and shell parsing errors, improving the clarity and usability of the documentation. ([#16753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16753))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened:
- [#17191](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17191) aims to fix an error related to the edit index in JetBrains editors.
- [#17192](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17192) addresses a typo in the documentation.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Interoperability Proof of Concept
A new issue was opened to track the completion and deployment of an interoperability Proof of Concept (POC) to the devnet. This is a key step towards enhancing cross-chain capabilities within the Superchain. ([#17190](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17190))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerting Improvements
Discussions continued on improving monitoring and alerting for flashblocks integration, particularly as op-sepolia approaches flashblocks enablement ([#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16388)). The latest comments from yashvardhan-kukreja (Aug 24, 2025) indicate an associated PR in the `k8s` repository ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/k8s/pull/7162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/k8s/pull/7162)). Earlier notes (July 24, 2025) outlined specific metrics and SLAs for monitoring, including:
- Minimum peer count (4).
- SLAs around block progression and divergence.
- Alerts for pending transactions exceeding thresholds (~60 or spikes).
- Flashblocks-related SLA metrics (p99 over time) using `reth_op_rbuilder_total_block_built_duration`.
- Monitoring `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` connections for failures and errors, with alerts for the absence of these metrics.
- Tracking `flashblocks-rpc` node-reth metrics for upstream errors and message rates.
- Ensuring `op-node-rbuilder` inherits most `op-node` alerts and metrics.
