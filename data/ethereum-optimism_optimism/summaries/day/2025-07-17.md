# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure with a new operator fees test and temporary skips for interop failures. Significant progress was also made on dispute game robustness and node sanity checks.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing and Test Infrastructure
A new feature was added to port the Isthmus operator fees test to devstack, which incidentally implements improved private-key management for devnet-sdk ([#16721](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16721)). Additionally, a temporal test skip was implemented for `op-acceptance-tests` due to `op-geth` version bump issues, specifically for interop acceptance test failures ([#16732](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16732)).

### Dispute Game and Node Stability Improvements
Work continued on improving the robustness of the dispute game system by adding a Super Dispute Game test case for unsafe proposals, where a game's root claim contains both valid and invalid output roots ([#16723](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16723)). Furthermore, sanity checks were introduced to `op-node` to prevent reorgs from supervisors when interop is not active and to limit reorgs to a day's worth of L2 blocks ([#16554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16554)).

### Dependency and Build Process Refinements
A fix was implemented in `dispute-mon` to remove the lazy dial option, addressing an issue where `op-dispute-mon` would fail on startup if a node was unavailable ([#16720](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16720)). A partial revert was also performed on Dockerfile retry changes, as they were causing issues ([#16739](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16739)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dispute Game and Fault Proof Testing
An issue related to adding a Super Dispute Game test covering unsafe proposals for a non-zero step was closed ([#15678](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15678)). Additionally, an investigation into adding NAT tests for the fault proof system was concluded ([#14118](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14118)).

### Node Sanity Checks and Devnet Improvements
The issue concerning the addition of sanity checks to `op-node` for interop was closed ([#15761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15761)). Improvements to private-key management and interfaces within `devnet-sdk` were also completed ([#15040](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15040)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Testing Infrastructure Challenges
A new issue was opened regarding handling failing tests in `op-acceptance-tests` due to an `op-geth` version bump, specifically for `v1.101511.1` ([#16731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16731)). Another issue proposes running Kurtosis tests against `op-geth` and `op-reth` repositories ([#16741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16741)).

### Code Structure and Build Process Improvements
An issue was created to reorganize MIPS logic to encapsulate memory access, aiming to prevent issues like those related to memory tracking and reservation handling ([#16736](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16736)). A general health issue was also opened to add retry mechanisms whilst building Docker images ([#16742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16742)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Etherscan to Blockscout Migration
Discussions are ongoing regarding the migration from Etherscan to Blockscout for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia ([#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1696)). The latest comments indicate that a pull request ([#1693](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1693)) addresses this migration and is awaiting reviews and approval.

### Porting TestPectra to Devstack
The issue of porting `TestPectra` to devstack is active ([#416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/416)). The latest comment confirms that this has been implemented in pull request [#16744](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16744).
