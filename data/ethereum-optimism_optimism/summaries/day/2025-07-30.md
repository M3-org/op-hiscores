## NEW ISSUES
### Fault Proof System Enhancements
A new issue, [#16910](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16910), was opened to address the scaling of the Cannon VM runner. The goal is to increase the coverage of mainnet blocks by the `op-challenger-runner`, which continuously runs Cannon and fault proof programs. The issue highlights that the current single-threaded nature of the fault proof program limits capacity, suggesting a need for improvements to handle more extensive testing and verification.
