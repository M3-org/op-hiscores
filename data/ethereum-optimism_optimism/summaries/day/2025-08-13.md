## NEW ISSUES
Several new issues were reported today:
*   **Go Compatibility and Tooling:** An issue was opened to support Go 1.25 in Cannon, aiming to test compatibility and fix any related problems ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17060)).
*   **Op-Sync-Tester Enhancements:** Two issues were created to improve the `op-sync-tester`. One proposes adding a caching layer and batching EL requests for faster synchronization ([#17046](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17046)), while the other suggests better session handling to reduce duplicated validation logic across RPCs ([#17047](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17047)).
*   **Op-Proposer Errors:** A user reported persistent errors with the `op-proposer`, including `GameAlreadyExists` messages, indicating potential issues with its operation ([#17042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17042)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
*   **Op-Challenger Acceptance Tests on Interop ([#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15948)):** This issue, focused on adding acceptance tests for `op-challenger` functionality on interop chains, was reopened today. The latest comment from mbaxter indicates that there are still outstanding TODOs pointing to this ticket that need to be addressed before it can be considered complete.
*   **Op-Sync-Tester: Support eth namespace ([#16700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16700)):** This issue, concerning the `op-sync-tester` supporting the `eth` namespace for RPC methods like `eth_getBlockReceipts`, `eth_getBlockByHash`, and `eth_getBlockByNumber`, was reopened today by pcw109550 to track the implementation of test cases for the `eth` namespace.
