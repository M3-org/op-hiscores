# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing supervisor error handling, updating `op-geth` for the latest Holocene activation, and significant bug fixes across test validation, Kurtosis devnet setup, and fault proof challenger addresses. A new script for `op-program` prestate building was also introduced.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Supervisor and Geth Enhancements
Improvements were made to the `op-supervisor` to map errors to relevant RPC error codes, enhancing interoperability and debugging ([#16652](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16652)). The `op-geth` module was also updated to include the latest SCR changes and the swell-mainnet Holocene activation time ([#16655](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16655)).

### Test Infrastructure and Devnet Stability
Significant bug fixes were implemented to ensure validation compliance for various test files across legacy, periphery, safe, and L2 bridge folders ([#16613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16613)). The Kurtosis devnet's reverse proxy setup was fixed to prevent non-working configurations ([#16638](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16638)). Additionally, the challenger address for devnet deploys in `op-e2e` was corrected to resolve CI workflow failures ([#16671](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16671)).

### OP-Program Tooling
A new script was added to `op-program` for building canonized prestates, which will be used to generate all `op-program` prestates and make more accurate decisions on prestate versions based on experimental and release cannon VM versions ([#16670](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16670)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Supervisor RPC Error Code Compliance
The issue regarding the `op-supervisor` RPC not matching the error-codes specification was closed ([#15771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15771)). This was addressed by mapping supervisor errors to relevant RPC error codes.

### Kurtosis Devnet Network Accessibility
The problem where the L1 Network was not accessible when running under `devnet-sdk` in `op-acceptor` was closed ([#16127](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16127)). The underlying issue was identified as a problem with reaching the L1 EL service through Kurtosis' reverse proxy.

## NEW ISSUES

### Interop Monitoring and Supervisor Authentication
A new issue was opened concerning the authentication story for `op-interop-mon` and `op-supervisor` ([#16672](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16672)). Currently, `op-interop-mon` calls `op-supervisor`'s `admin_SetFailsafeEnabled` API, and while supervisors are presently in local networks, authentication considerations are needed for this API.
