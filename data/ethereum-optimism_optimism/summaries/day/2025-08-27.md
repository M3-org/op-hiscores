# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Aug 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `op-devstack` with Kona supervisor support, critical bug fixes in `op-program`, and significant additions to testing infrastructure, particularly for `op-sync-tester` and `op-up`. Several new issues were opened to track the integration of Kona and Cannon for fault proofs.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Devstack and Challenger Enhancements
The `op-devstack` now supports the `kona-supervisor` within its `sysgo` orchestrator, enabling its launch as part of the devstack system ([#17195](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17195)). Additionally, the `op-devstack` was improved to verify contract deployment transactions are actually included, preventing race conditions ([#17232](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17232)). The `op-challenger` gained an option to restrict the frequency of update cycles, reducing L1 node calls ([#17233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17233)).

### Program and Sync Tester Improvements
A bug in `op-program` related to the length check for pending progress during the consolidate step was fixed ([#17220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17220)). The `op-sync-tester` received significant updates, adding Verifier Engine APIs (`engine_newPayloadV1`, `engine_getPayloadV1`, `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1`, etc.) to support Bedrock, Canyon, and Delta hardforks ([#17234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17234)).

### Testing and CI Updates
Unit tests were added for `op-up` ([#17210](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17210)). The CI configuration was updated to run the same jobs on the `proposal/op-contracts/v4.1.0` branch as on `develop` ([#17211](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17211)). Cannon baseline files were updated to align with the geth 1.16.2 upgrade ([#17230](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17230)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Feature Development**: New features include a CLI wrapper for Forge binary execution ([#17235](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17235)) and an interop portal ([#17247](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17247)).
- **Bug Fixes**: A fix for the `sync-tester` to correct the PayloadV4 version check in `GetPayloadV4` was opened ([#17236](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17236)).
- **Testing and Infrastructure**: A pull request to add edge case tests for `Blueprint.bytesToUint` function was opened ([#17240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17240)). There's also a new PR to introduce `BlockBuilder` in the `op-node` engine package ([#17241](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17241)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fault Proof System Enhancements
The tracking issue for the Interop proofs U17 proof upgrade workstream has been closed ([#15980](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15980)). This indicates progress in the ongoing efforts to improve the fault proof system.

### Testing Infrastructure Improvements
Support for flashblocks in Kurtosis, a key component for testing, has been addressed and the issue closed ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16514)). However, a comment notes this task is currently deprioritized and will not be fully implemented as initially planned, with tests mostly done but two PRs needing cleanup.

### Challenger and Program Stability
An issue providing an option to limit how often games are processed by `op-challenger` has been closed ([#13090](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13090)), which should reduce L1 node calls. A bug regarding an invalid pending progress length check in `op-program`'s state transition has also been resolved ([#15217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15217)).

### Sync Tester Engine Support
The issue tracking the `op-sync-tester`'s support for the engine namespace, including methods like `engine_newPayload` and `engine_forkchoiceUpdated`, has been closed ([#16701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16701)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Kona + Cannon Integration
Several new issues were opened to track the integration of Kona and Cannon as a fallback proof option:
- Main tracking issue for shipping Kona + Cannon as a fallback fault proof ([#17237](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17237)).
- Adding Kona + Cannon to `vm-runner` for testing with real mainnet blocks ([#17238](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17238)).
- Integrating Kona + Cannon into `op-challenger`, including adding a `cannon-kona` trace type ([#17239](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17239)).

### Protocol Stability and Testing
New issues address critical aspects of protocol stability and testing:
- Edits for the U17 governance proposal related to proofs ([#17244](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17244)).
- Investigating `op-node` instability triggered by L1 RPC delays, particularly when L1 RPC is slow ([#17245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17245)).
- Enabling flashblock tests against persistent devnets in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17248)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Forge Deployer Migration
Discussions continue on the migration of OP Deployer to use Forge.
- **[Forge Deployer] Create CLI wrapper around Forge binary** ([#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17214)): `tooshiNoko` expressed interest in taking this task.
- **[Tracking] [Forge Deployer] OP Deployer Forge Migration** ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17213)): `tooshiNoko` noted that they submitted [#17235](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17235) and suggested syncing up with `bitwiseguy` to avoid overlapping work, also expressing a desire to take on all related tasks.
- **[Forge Deployer] Convert DeploySuperchain to use Forge** ([#17215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17215)): `tooshiNoko` asked if they could take this task.
- **[Forge Deployer] Convert DeployImplementations to use Forge** ([#17216](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17216)): `tooshiNoko` asked if they could take this task.
- **[Forge Deployer] Convert DeployOPChain to use Forge** ([#17217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17217)): `tooshiNoko` asked if they could take this task.
- **[Forge Deployer] Convert contract verification logic to use Forge** ([#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17218)): `tooshiNoko` asked if they could take this task.

The common theme across these issues is `tooshiNoko`'s active engagement and interest in leading the Forge migration efforts.
