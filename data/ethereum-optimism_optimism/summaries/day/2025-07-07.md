# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 7, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in testing infrastructure with improvements to proof tests and the addition of a Gnosis Safe client. Documentation for the op-supervisor was also updated.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
- **Improved Proofs Testing**: The flakiness of proofs withdrawal tests was reduced by moving them to a dedicated package, optimizing test efficiency by isolating time-consuming operations. ([#16628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16628))
- **Gnosis Safe Client Integration**: A new Gnosis Safe client was added to `op-service`, providing robust transaction sending capabilities with built-in gas estimation and retry logic. ([#16629](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16629))

### Documentation Updates
- **Supervisor Readme Enhancement**: A "failsafe" section was added to the `op-supervisor` README, improving documentation clarity. ([#16601](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16601))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#16631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16631) Fix logic for updating oldestL1Origin in ChannelBuilder
- [#16633](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16633) op-acceptance-tests: Pre-interop super proposer tests
- [#16634](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16634) op-node: experimental spike

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Configuration and Validation
- **Netchef Configuration for Flashblocks**: An issue related to Netchef rendering flashblock websocket configurations for HA conductors was closed, indicating progress in automatically bootstrapping `flashblocks-websocket-proxy`. ([#15940](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15940))
- **Flashblocks Gate Awareness**: An issue concerning the flashblocks gate's awareness of `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` was opened and closed on the same day, with an associated PR mentioned. ([#16630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16630))

## NEW ISSUES

### Flashblocks Acceptance Test Requirements
- **Flashblocks Gate Validation**: A new issue was opened to ensure the flashblocks gate validates streaming from `flashblocks-websocket-proxy`, as it currently only expects streaming from rbuilders. ([#16630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16630))
- **Non-Interop Transaction Handling**: An issue was created to add an acceptance test for rbuilder's ability to accept non-interop transactions even when the supervisor RPC is unavailable in an interop setting. ([#16632](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16632))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node Interop Logic
- **Pre-Interop Logic in Trivial-Interop Case**: Issue [#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16520) discusses adding a mode to `op-node` to use pre-Interop logic when a supervisor is not provided in trivial interop cases. The latest comment from tynes on July 9th indicates that this issue will be closed as it is no longer a priority. Previously, tynes also inquired on July 7th about the feasibility of running services in the same process, similar to `op-e2e` or `sysgo`, to address this.
