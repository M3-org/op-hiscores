# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in core protocol development with the removal of Jovian feature toggles and enhancements to the OPCM for upgrade-specific allowances. Several CI/CD and `op-deployer` related bug fixes were also implemented, improving the development pipeline.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Protocol Enhancements
The Jovian feature toggles were removed as the scope is now fixed, streamlining the codebase related to this upgrade ([#17978](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17978)). Additionally, the OPCM (Optimism Contracts Manager) was updated to allow upgrade-specific allowances for extra instructions, enhancing flexibility and security for future releases ([#18462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18462)).

### CI/CD and Deployment Tooling Improvements
Multiple bug fixes were implemented to improve the CI/CD pipeline and the `op-deployer` tool. This included fixing error handling in the `add_game_type` CLI parsing ([#18532](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18532)), adding `attach-workspace` to the `docker-build` workflow ([#18543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18543)), and addressing flakey Slack notifications in acceptance tests ([#18542](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18542)). Several pipeline fixes for `op-deployer` versions 4 and 5 were also backported ([#18539](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18539), [#18538](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18538), [#18545](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18545), [#18544](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18544)).

### Test Infrastructure Updates
A test for the superchain config address was fixed in `op-deployer` ([#18537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18537)). An exclusion was also added for `ReinitializableBase.t.sol` in the AI test maintenance system to prevent it from blocking while a permanent solution is developed ([#18531](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18531)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Jovian Fork and Precompile Testing
The issue concerning running precompile FP tests on the Jovian fork has been closed ([#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17348)).

### Upgrade 17 Releases and Governance
The task to finalize Upgrade 17 releases, generate prestate, and prepare governance post details has been completed and closed ([#17982](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17982)).

## NEW ISSUES

### OPCM v2 and CGT Enablement
A new issue has been opened to remove checks for the use of OPCM v2 to enable CGT, indicating a potential simplification of logic related to OPCM v2 and its interaction with CGT ([#18536](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18536)).

### Upgrade 18 Finalization
An issue has been created to finalize the releases for Upgrade 18, pending governance approval for `op-program` and sufficient testnet runtime for other components ([#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18548)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Removal of `isPectra` from the Batcher ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18479))
Discussion continues on removing the `isPectra` flag from the batcher. The latest comments indicate that changes are needed in approximately five Go files. A contributor has expressed interest in taking on this task, and their offer has been accepted. The consensus is that since the Pectra fork is now well in the past, the L1 can be assumed to have Pectra enabled, which would simplify a significant portion of the batcher's code.
