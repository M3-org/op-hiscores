# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on bug fixes in op-conductor and contracts-bedrock, alongside enhancements to CI/CD for op-node sync tests and op-dispute-mon for cannon-kona games.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Infrastructure & Testing Improvements
*   Enabled OPM and Base mainnet op-node sync tests in CircleCI, including Slack notifications for failures, enhancing continuous integration robustness [#17393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17393).
*   Added a standalone check for `solc` warnings in contracts-bedrock, improving code quality and preventing potential issues [#17403](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17403).

### Bug Fixes & Maintenance
*   Corrected the p2p healthcheck in op-conductor to properly utilize the r. [#17294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17294).
*   Removed unused variables from the FDG_V2 test file in `packages/contracts-bedrock`, streamlining the codebase [#17400](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17400).

### Dispute Monitoring Enhancements
*   Introduced support for cannon-kona games in op-dispute-mon, expanding its monitoring capabilities [#17380](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17380).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#17410](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17410) refactor(op-batcher): thread shutdownCtx to AltDA, avoid global ctx
*   [#17417](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17417) Move block building to sequencer
*   [#17418](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17418) jovian: add acceptance test for the da footprint limit

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kurtosis Devnet Deprioritization
*   Several Kurtosis-related issues were closed as they are no longer a priority or will not be implemented, including adding genesis checks to optimism-package [#15753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15753), improving Kurtosis idempotency/performance [#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14390), extracting/mapping L1 chain config [#15050](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15050), creating tests for proxyd [#15558](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15558), adding a rotatory welcome message [#15511](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15511), investigating selective service selection [#15537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15537), and adding Kurtosis support to op-validator [#16712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16712).

### Infrastructure Security & Dispute Game Updates
*   An issue concerning infra threat modeling related to flashblocks delivery was closed, with a short-term mitigation identified to hardcode image digests in Kubernetes deployment manifests [#17144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17144).
*   An issue regarding the use of v2 dispute game implementations in OPCM.addGameType was closed as a duplicate [#17259](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17259).

## NEW ISSUES

### Op-Program Enhancements
*   A new issue was opened to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in op-program specifications, aiming to improve lookup efficiency [#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17416).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis Websockets Support
The discussion on [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17194) regarding Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy indicates that this feature will not be implemented. The latest comments confirm the intention to close the issue after removing a related TODO from the codebase.
