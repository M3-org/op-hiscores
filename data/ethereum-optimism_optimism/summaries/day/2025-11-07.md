# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 7, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the batch decoder, removing an old script related to OPCMv2 cleanup, and preparing the CI for Kona prestate verification. Several issues related to devnet stability and infrastructure were closed, alongside new issues tracking Fusaka integration and Geth upgrades.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Batch Decoder and Configuration Improvements
The batch decoder was enhanced to correctly load rollup configurations using the L2 chain ID, improving its functionality for reassembly and fetching operations.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher [altda] Max Frame Size Limit
Discussion continues on [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17796) regarding the `op-batcher`'s `max frame size` limit in generic commitment mode for altDA. A recent comment suggests that the issue might have been addressed by PR [#18074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074), prompting a question about closing the issue. There's also a note about updating the spec to reflect the changes, as the current spec might contain outdated information regarding `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE`.
