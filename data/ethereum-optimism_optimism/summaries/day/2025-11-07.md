# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 7, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the batch decoder for L2 chain ID configuration, removing an old migration script, and preparing the CI for Kona prestate verification. Several issues related to devnet stability and infrastructure were closed, while new issues emerged concerning Geth upgrades and Fusaka integration.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Batch Decoder Improvements
The batch decoder was fixed to ensure a complete rollup configuration for reassembly and now supports loading configurations via the L2 chain ID. The `fetch` command was also enhanced to allow L2 chain ID specification. ([#18209](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18209))

### Codebase Cleanup and CI Enhancements
A script for generating OPCM migration calldata was removed as part of pre-OPCMv2 cleanup. Additionally, support for Cannon-Kona prestate builds was added to the monorepo's CI, preparing for future verification processes. ([#18212](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18212), [#18175](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18175))

### Devstack Stability Fixes
An issue causing concurrent runs for `TestSyncTesterHFS` tests in the CI was addressed by removing fetching for cluster depset in `op-devstack`. ([#18211](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18211))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Devnet Infrastructure and Testing Enhancements
Several issues related to the Kurtosis devnet were closed, including re-introducing per-PR checks ([#15672](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15672)), adding missing observability dashboards ([#15981](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15981)), implementing selective devnet containers for faster startup ([#15510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15510)), and hiding verbose output ([#15512](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15512)). The ability to run OPCM as part of a test was also addressed ([#15508](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15508)).

### Interoperability and Devnet Rehearsals
Work on hardening the proxy daemon to filter invalid cross-chain messages ([#15848](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15848)) and conducting Uniswap devnet rehearsals ([#15852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15852)) was completed. The phase 1.5 Unichain Parallel Devnet Interoperable L2s initiative was also closed ([#15887](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15887)).

### Core Protocol and Testing Updates
Issues related to the Operator Fee Scalar Fix ([#16810](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16810)) and Calldata Footprint Limit ([#16998](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16998)) were closed. Integration of Kona + Cannon standard prestates ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17283)) and preparation of `op-batcher` for Fusaka ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17472)) were also completed. A flaky test, `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor`, was investigated and closed as fixed ([#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17548)).

### CI and Test Stability
A specific issue regarding concurrent runs for `TestSyncTesterHFS` tests in CI was identified and closed on the same day it was opened, indicating a quick resolution ([#18210](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18210)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Geth Upgrade Tracking
A series of new issues were opened to track the upstream merges for various Geth versions, including v1.16.4 ([#18217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18217)), v1.16.5 ([#18218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18218)), v1.16.6 ([#18219](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18219)), and v1.16.7 ([#18216](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18216), [#18220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18220)).

### Fusaka Integration on L2
A tracking issue was created for Fusaka integration on L2, noting that many items depend on upgrading `op-geth` in the monorepo's `go.mod` and highlighting further design considerations ([#18215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18215)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher [altda]: should not limit max frame size to max input size in generic mode ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17796))
The discussion revolves around whether the `op-batcher` should limit the max frame size to the max input size in generic mode for alternative data availability (altDA). A recent comment from `nuke-web3` on November 7th suggests that the current spec might be outdated, as it states derivation must skip input data larger than `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` when `commitment_type == 0`. This implies that the spec needs to be updated to reflect the current implementation, which seems to have addressed this limitation. Previously, `tessr` on November 6th asked if the issue could be closed, referencing a pull request ([#18074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074)) that addressed the issue. `sebastianst` on October 28th had suggested opening a PR with a specific commit to merge the fix. The latest comment indicates a potential discrepancy between the current spec and the implemented solution.
