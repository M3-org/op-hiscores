# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, particularly for L1 Osaka activation and EL payload caching, alongside critical updates to L1 chain configuration embedding and dependency management. Several issues related to testing and configuration were closed, and new discussions emerged around L2CL documentation and SuperchainConfig transactions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Test Validation and CI Integration
Improvements were made to the test validation process, specifically adding library support to address failures with internal-only functions in libraries ([#17690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17690)). Additionally, CI now includes an isolated `CANNON_KONA` devfeature flag to ensure proper sequencing before `DEPLOY_V2_` ([#17702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17702)). A bug fix was also implemented to ensure flaky test reports only show tests for the target branch ([#17706](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17706)).

### Critical L1 Chain Configuration and Dependency Updates
The L1ChainConfig is now embedded directly into the configuration for `op-node`, `op-program`, and `kona` to better handle L1 block info and blob base fees, especially relevant since Ecotone ([#17568](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17568)). A dependency on `go-bip39` was replaced with `github.com/base/go-bip39` due to the former's removal from Google ([#17526](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17526)).

### Advanced E2E and Acceptance Testing
New tests were added to validate L1 Osaka activation ([#17666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17666)) and to cache and canonicalize L2EL payloads after gap filling in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17675)). A test for resolving L1 chain configuration by chain ID was also introduced in `op-program` ([#17707](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17707)).

### Refinements in Deployment and Node Architecture
The `DeployOPChain.s.sol` script was refactored to conform to an input/output struct pattern, simplifying its usage ([#17657](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17657)). The `EngineResetDeriver` was merged with `EngineController` in `op-node`, streamlining the node's architecture and reducing parameter passing ([#17662](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17662)). Custom gas limit configuration was backported to `op-deployer` for greater flexibility ([#17665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17665)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Test Validation and Configuration Improvements
The issue of extending `lint-forge-tests-check-no-build` to handle library artifacts was resolved ([#16662](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16662)). Additionally, issues related to `op-program/chainconfig` tests following Fusaka defense changes ([#17700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17700)) and moving L1 config resolution out of executors in `op-challenger` ([#17703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17703)) were closed.

### Isthmus Upgrade Completion
The tracker for the Isthmus Upgrade has been closed, indicating its completion ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12703)).

### Node Compatibility and EL Sync Conditions
The issue concerning `op-node` preparation for Fusaka was closed ([#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17493)). The investigation into L2CL<>L2EL conditions for starting EL Syncing was also closed, with the conclusion that the issue is handled by `engineController.insertUnsafePayload` ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17628)).

### Acceptance Test Reporting
The acceptance test issue regarding including setup info in HTML output was closed ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/386)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Documentation and Configuration Gaps
New issues highlight the need for better documentation of EL Sync behavior in `op-node` and `kona-node` ([#17693](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17693)). There's also a requirement to create calldata for SuperchainConfig transactions in `op-deployer` for `op-contracts/v4.x.x` and beyond ([#17698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17698)).

### Jovian Activation Block Requirements
A new issue specifies that the Jovian activation block must only contain deposit transactions, aligning with recent spec updates ([#17704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17704)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go1.25 Compatibility ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17060))
Discussion continues regarding the compatibility of Cannon with Go 1.25. The latest comments confirm that the issue affects Optimism, specifically causing incorrect Keccak hashes when running Cannon with Go 1.25. This impacts the calculation of block hashes and potentially other cryptographic operations. A specific Go issue ([https://github.com/golang/go/issues/74998](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/74998)) is identified as the underlying problem, and it's noted that Go 1.25.1 does not appear to include the necessary MIPS fix.

### op-acceptance-test: add back op-reth to jovian kt-devnet ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17475))
The latest comment suggests that since Kurtosis devnet is deprecated, the focus should shift to integrating `op-reth` into the `devstack / sysgo` system instead of adding it back to the Jovian kt-devnet. This indicates a change in strategy for `op-reth` integration.
