# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the Optimism ecosystem with new features, critical bug fixes, and significant progress in the `op-challenger` for ZK game types. Key updates include a script for deploying safer safes, improved AI test handling, and fixes for L1 reorgs and batcher channel duration.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Security and AI Test System
A new script was added to deploy safer safes using a default salt and fix the interface, improving contract security. Additionally, the AI Contracts Test Maintenance System now supports test files that require no changes, preventing failures when Devin determines no modifications are needed.
- Deploy Safer Safes Script: [#18448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18448)
- AI Test System Improvement: [#18484](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18484)

### Critical Bug Fixes for Node and Batcher Stability
Two significant bugs were addressed: one preventing the L1 origin selector from getting stuck on reorgs in `op-node`, and another fixing `MaxChannelDuration` tracking in `op-batcher` for large block backlogs. These fixes enhance the stability and reliability of the Optimism network.
- L1 Origin Selector Fix: [#18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)
- Batcher MaxChannelDuration Fix: [#18327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18327)

### Advancements in Optimistic ZK Game Challenging
Significant progress was made in the `op-challenger` to support optimistic ZK games. This includes the ability to challenge proposals that are still unsafe, reclaim bonds, and resolve these game types, alongside new tests for delegate-called precompiles and conditional skipping of acceptance tests.
- Challenge Unsafe ZK Proposals: [#18467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18467)
- Reclaim Bonds for ZK Games: [#18465](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18465)
- Resolve Optimistic ZK Games: [#18464](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18464)
- Test FPP for Delegatecalled Precompiles: [#18475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18475)
- Skip Acceptance Tests for CGT: [#18487](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18487)

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolution of Batcher and ZK Game Challenges
Several issues related to the `op-batcher` and the `op-challenger` for ZK game types have been closed. This includes fixing max channel duration tracking for large block backlogs and significant progress in supporting ZK game types within the challenger.
- Batcher Max Channel Duration Fix: [#18092](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18092)
- Challenger Support for ZK Game Types: [#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18321)
- Challenge Unsafe ZK Games: [#18466](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18466)

### Streamlining ZK Proof Generation and Challenger Configuration
Discussions around which service should generate ZK proofs concluded with the decision to use the succinct proposer. Additionally, several issues concerning challenger test coverage, reading from the DGF registry, fetching challenger bonds, reloading bond values, and supporting challenger address changes were closed as the `op-challenger` can now handle these aspects for ZK games.

## NEW ISSUES

### New Tools and Infrastructure for Devnets
A new `op-spammer` component is proposed for deployment in devnets to periodically send user transactions, aiding in bug detection.
- Create `op-spammer` component: [#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18482)

### Batcher and Interop Proofs Enhancements
Discussions are initiated to remove `isPectra` from the batcher to simplify code, assuming Pectra is enabled on L1. Additionally, a new issue tracks the ongoing work for interop proofs, focusing on supporting the new supernode.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### OP Constants Usage Review
Issue [#13440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13440) discusses the underutilization of OP constants. The latest comment suggests that this issue might already be resolved and asks for confirmation to close it.

### Fusaka-on-L2 Acceptance Tests
Issue [#18221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18221) tracks the creation of acceptance tests for new EIPs in fusaka-on-l2. The latest comment indicates that additional acceptance tests may be added to ensure features not included in fusaka-on-l2 are properly disabled on OP chains.

### Op-node Stuck in EL Sync Mode
Issue [#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18468) describes a problem where `op-node` gets stuck in an initialization loop after restarting when configured with `--syncmode=execution-layer` and Reth has already synced data. The latest comment confirms that this issue is affecting a Base Mainnet node, highlighting its critical impact.
