# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the Optimism ecosystem with new features like SaferSafes deployment and AI test system improvements, alongside critical bug fixes for `op-node` and `op-batcher`. Significant progress was also made in `op-challenger` for optimistic ZK games.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Protocol Stability and Reliability
Critical bug fixes were implemented to improve the stability and reliability of core Optimism components. The `op-node` addressed an issue where the L1 origin selector could get stuck during reorgs ([#18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)). The `op-batcher` also received a fix for `MaxChannelDuration` tracking, particularly for large block backlogs, which included adding time travel support for L2 chains in `op-devstack` and a new integration test ([#18327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18327), [#18480](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18480)).

### Optimistic ZK Game Enhancements
Significant work was done on the `op-challenger` to support optimistic ZK games. This includes the ability to challenge proposals that are still unsafe ([#18467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18467)), reclaim bonds ([#18465](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18465)), and resolve these game types ([#18464](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18464)). New tests were also added to assert fault proof execution of delegatecalled precompiles ([#18475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18475)).

### Developer Tooling and Infrastructure Improvements
A new script was added to deploy SaferSafes using a default salt and fix the interface ([#18448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18448)). The AI Contracts Test Maintenance System was improved to handle cases where no changes are needed in test files, preventing system failures ([#18484](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18484)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Batcher Stability and ZK Game Support
The `op-batcher`'s `MaxChannelDuration` tracking issue for large block backlogs has been resolved ([#18092](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18092)). Additionally, the investigation into which service should generate ZK proofs concluded, with the succinct proposer being chosen ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18319)).

### Challenger Enhancements for ZK Games
Several issues related to the `op-challenger`'s support for ZK games have been closed. This includes the ability to challenge ZK game types ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18321)), improved test coverage ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18427)), reading from the DGF registry using `kona-genesis` crate ([#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18412)), fetching challenger bond from game arguments ([#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18413)), reloading bond values ([#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18414)), and supporting challenger address changes ([#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18415)). The issue of challenging optimistic ZK games where the proposal is currently unsafe has also been addressed ([#18466](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18466)).

## NEW ISSUES

### New Component Development
A new `op-spammer` component is proposed for deployment in devnets to periodically send user transactions, aiding in bug detection ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18482)).

### Protocol Simplification and Interoperability
Discussion has begun on removing `isPectra` from the batcher to simplify code, assuming Pectra is enabled on L1 ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18479)). A new issue tracks the proofs work for interop, supporting the new supernode ([#18483](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18483)).

### Kona and SP1 Migration
A task has been opened to migrate to the latest SP1 version to address LGPL licensing issues and update to the latest 5.x.x based SP1 crates ([#18489](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18489)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node` EL Sync Mode Issue
Users are experiencing `op-node` getting stuck in an initialization loop with `el_syncing=true` after restarting when configured with `--syncmode=execution-layer` and Reth has already synced data ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18468)). A temporary workaround suggested is to change the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restart the `op-node`. This issue is currently blocking Base Mainnet nodes.

### OP Constants Usage
There's an ongoing discussion about the usage of OP constants, with many defined constants not being utilized. A suggestion was made to close the issue if it's already addressed ([#13440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13440)).

### Fusaka-on-L2 Acceptance Tests
Plans are underway to split the acceptance tests for new EIPs in `fusaka-on-l2` into sub-issues. There's also a consideration to add acceptance tests to ensure features not included in `fusaka-on-l2` are properly disabled on OP chains ([#18221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18221)).
