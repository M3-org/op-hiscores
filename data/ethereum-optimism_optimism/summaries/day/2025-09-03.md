# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing SystemConfig with feature flagging, fixing a comment in op-node, and adding sync-tester with external EL for improved testing. Significant progress was made in closing several long-standing issues related to proofs, Drippie, and Cannon support.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Protocol Enhancements
- **Feature Flagging in SystemConfig**: Added functionality to the `SystemConfig` for feature flagging, allowing features to be toggled on or off by the ProxyAdmin or its owner. This provides greater control and flexibility for future protocol upgrades ([#17281](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17281)).
- **op-node Cache Size Comment Fix**: Corrected a comment in `op-node` regarding the `l1.cache-size` to accurately reflect the `defaultCacheSize` as 3/2 of the sequencing window ([#17107](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17107)).

### Testing and CI Improvements
- **External EL Sync Tester Integration**: Integrated a sync-tester with an external Execution Layer (EL) to improve testing capabilities, specifically provisioning the L2 genesis config to match the external network's configuration ([#17251](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17251)).
- **CI Job Relocation**: Migrated the `publish-cannon-prestates` CI job from Latitude to CircleCI boxes to address network flakiness and improve resource utilization ([#17296](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17296)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Proofs and Drippie Management
- **Stage 1.4 Shipping Checklist**: Completed the checklist for shipping Stage 1.4, including security audits ([#15827](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15827)).
- **Interop Proofs Details for Governance**: Finalized details for interop proofs to be used in governance proposals ([#15968](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15968)).
- **Drippie Integration for Challenger Funds**: Implemented the use of Drippie to manage hot wallet funds for the challenger, improving funding management ([#12876](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12876)).
- **Drippie Mainnet Deployment**: Successfully deployed Drippie to Mainnet ([#13764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13764)).
- **Drippie Dashboards and Alerting**: Configured and integrated Drippie dashboards and alerting for better monitoring ([#14048](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14048)).

### Cannon and VM Runner Enhancements
- **Full `mips64r2` ISA Support in Cannon**: Added support for the full `mips64r2` Instruction Set Architecture in Cannon ([#13969](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13969)).
- **Cannon VM Runner Scaling**: Addressed the scaling of the Cannon VM Runner to cover more mainnet blocks ([#16910](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16910)).

### Devnet and Protocol Specifications
- **Scripted Permissionless Devnet Spinup**: Improved the devnet spinup runbook by providing a runnable shell script for permissionless upgrades ([#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/346)).
- **Min-Base-Fee `uint64` Addition**: Added an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3` as per protocol specifications ([#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/650)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Testing and Acceptance Test Expansion
- **Additional Sync Tester Tests**: Proposed splitting existing sync tester tests and implementing more, including multiple CLs with a single Sync Tester and user transactions within L2 blocks ([#17313](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17313)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Sync Tester and Acceptance Tests
- **Sync Test using Sync-Tester** ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16703)): The issue was reopened as not all Hardfork transitions were tested. Future plans include testing every OP Stack HF transition, multiple CLs with a single Sync Tester, and user transactions within L2 blocks.

### Cannon and Go Version Compatibility
- **Cannon: Support go1.25** ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17060)): Discussion confirms Go 1.25.1 has been released, but it does not appear to include the MIPS fix.

### CircleCI Configuration Improvements
- **Improve UX and testability of CircleCI config** ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17184)): Discussions are ongoing to improve the CircleCI configuration. Key pain points include the difficulty of local testing and the large size of the config. Suggestions include identifying high-value monorepo CI jobs for local execution, addressing prerequisite setup automation, and potentially dynamically sorting Go tests by run duration to optimize CI job allocation.

### Kona + Cannon Integration
- **Kona + Cannon: OPCM support** ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17285)): Verification is needed to determine what changes are required in OPCM to support Kona + Cannon, specifically ensuring OPCM does not assume Cannon as the game type and updating the `OPContractsManager.sol` contract.
- **Kona + Cannon: standard prestates integration** ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17283)): Discussions suggest adding support for Cannon + Kona prestates to `standard-prestates.toml` using a new type field like `cannon-kona`.

### op-node/p2p/gossip Configuration
- **op-node/p2p/gossip - ConfigureGossip overwrites sane defaults with zero values** ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17308)): The issue describes how `ConfigureGossip` can overwrite sane defaults with zero values, leading to panics in tests due to invalid configurations (e.g., `Dhi=0` and `Dscore=4`). A proposed solution involves ensuring that zero values in the configuration do not clobber intended defaults. An alternative suggestion is to implement a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to return a fully valid configuration with sensible defaults, allowing tests to modify only necessary options.
