# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jun 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on critical bug fixes in the op-deployer, enhancements to CI processes for contract dependencies, and documentation updates for custom Superchains. Several new issues were opened concerning supervisor behavior and migration scripts.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Deployment Tooling Enhancements
A bug fix was implemented in the `op-deployer` to correctly handle the L1 contracts release flag, ensuring proper deployment configurations.
- [#16316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16316)

### CI Pipeline Optimization
Improvements were made to the CI pipeline to streamline the installation of contract dependencies, including caching `solc` compiler versions to prevent repeated downloads.
- [#16317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16317)
- [#16318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16318)

### Documentation for Custom Superchains
New documentation was added to the `op-deployer` to guide users on custom Superchain deployments, replacing previous draft content.
- [#16309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16309)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#16311](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16311): Removed duplicated code in `IsCrossUnsafe` function.
- [#16313](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16313): `op-chain-ops`: Removed `GasTokenDeployConfig`.
- [#16328](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16328): `dependabot(gomod)`: Bumped `golang.org/x/crypto` from 0.35.0 to 0.39.0.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Depset Validation Update
The issue regarding depset validation to check `EthLockboxProxy` consistency was closed, indicating that the necessary checks are now in place.
- [#16058](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16058)

## NEW ISSUES

### Supervisor Reset Behavior
New issues were opened to improve the `op-supervisor`'s handling of reset targets, L1 origin validity during resets, and behavior during reorgs.
- [#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16314)
- [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16315)
- [#16321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16321)

### OPCM Migration Script Improvements
An issue was created to track improvements for the OPCM migration script, specifically for calling `migrate` on `rehearsal-net-0`.
- [#16326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16326)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fault Proofs with Non-Genesis Interop
Discussion on [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16166) revolves around fixing the `op-supervisor`'s ability to provide data for fault proofs with non-genesis interop upgrades. Recent comments suggest that fixing this in the `op-supervisor` is preferred over the `op-challenger` due to data availability. Options include handling pre-interop super roots by the `op-challenger` manually constructing the root or by the supervisor indexing the safe DB from the first random derived block. The title was updated to clarify that the fix is needed in `op-supervisor`.

### Incorrect Nonce from `eth_getTransactionCount`
Issue [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/623) highlights an incorrect nonce returned by `eth_getTransactionCount` for pending transactions on the Base node. Users are requesting updates on the investigation and resolution of this problem, as it leads to stuck transactions in the mempool.

### Interop Sync Test Fix
Issue [#16187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16187) discusses fixing interop sync tests that relied on supervisor multinode support, which is being deprecated. The issue was marked as done by pcw109550, indicating progress on adapting these tests.
