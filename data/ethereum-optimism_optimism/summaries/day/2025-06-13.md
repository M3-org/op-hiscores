# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jun 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on addressing a critical dependency issue with `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` and introducing a new RPC method for the op-proposer. Discussions continued on improving CI reliability and acceptance test flakiness.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Proposer RPC Enhancements
A new RPC method, `admin_propose`, has been added to the op-proposer, likely to provide administrative control over proposal submissions.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Investigating and Improving CI Flakiness
Discussions on [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16271) continued with `scharissis` providing an update on June 13th, linking to related issues and a PR ([#16411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16411)) that likely contributes to the investigation. The issue was later closed on June 24th, with `scharissis` summarizing the efforts made, including the release and iteration of a test flake report generator, and improved test flakiness.

### Improving Reliability of Acceptance Tests
On [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16378), `scharissis` shared a new "Flakiness Report" on June 13th, which includes "Job Name" to help identify the backend used and potential sources of flakiness. The report aims to provide more clues for debugging. The issue was later closed on July 9th by `nonsense`, stating that tests have been considerably improved and emphasizing continuous monitoring of CI and test flakiness.
