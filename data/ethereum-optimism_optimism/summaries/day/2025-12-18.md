# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant upgrades to the Optimism Contracts Manager (OPCM) with v2 support, crucial bug fixes in L1 origin selection and dispute game proposals, and extensive test suite enhancements for succinct fault proofs.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### OPCM v2 Integration and Deployment Enhancements
The deployment pipeline now supports OPCM v2, allowing conditional routing of deployments and disabling v1 functions when v2 is active. This feature flag-driven approach ensures a smooth transition and improved contract management capabilities. Work is also underway to support interop migration within OPCMv2 and to integrate OPCM v2 with superchain deployment reading.

- [#18520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18520)

### Improved L1 Origin Selection and Dispute Game Fixes
Critical bug fixes were implemented to refine L1 origin selection logic, making it more robust and readable. Additionally, issues with incorrect proposals in SuperFaultDisputeGames within op-e2e tests were resolved, enhancing the reliability of dispute game simulations.

- [#18647](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18647)

### Enhanced Fault Proofs and Testing Infrastructure
Updates were made to ensure provable output roots in SuperFaultDisputeGames by requiring proposers to provide the super root preimage. The test suite for succinct fault dispute games was also updated to align with established conventions, and a custom `Test` contract was introduced to ensure reproducible `makeAddr` functionality across tests.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#18649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18649) feat: support interop migration in OPCMv2: This PR aims to add support for interop migration within the new OPCMv2 framework.
- [#18648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18648) chore(ctb): move init bond value to CommonTest: This PR proposes moving the initial bond value to a `CommonTest` contract for better organization and reusability.
- [#18645](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18645) migrate to branch protection to enforce 2 reviewers for contract folder: This PR suggests migrating to branch protection rules to enforce a two-reviewer requirement for changes within the `contract` folder, enhancing code quality and security.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fault Proof VM and Dispute Game Specifications
The Cannon FPVM specification has been updated to include Go 1.24 features, specifically the `getrandom` syscall changes. This ensures the fault proof system remains current with underlying Go language updates.
- [#17207](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17207)

### SuperFaultDisputeGame Enhancements
Several issues related to the `SuperFaultDisputeGame` were addressed, including the implementation of `rootClaim(uint256 l2ChainID)` and the requirement for proposers to provide the super root preimage when creating `SuperFaultDisputeGame`s. This strengthens the integrity and provability of super roots.

- [#18521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18521)

### Succinct Dispute Game Testing and Interop Action Tests
Unit tests for the `OPSuccinctFaultDisputeGame` contract were added and updated to follow repository conventions, verifying the ZK-based fault dispute game logic. Additionally, an issue ensuring that Kona interop action tests are not disabled was closed, indicating these tests are now active.

## NEW ISSUES

### Super Root Trace Output Review
A new issue has been opened to review the correct trace output when the next super root is not found in `op-challenger`. The current behavior of transitioning to `InvalidTransitionHash` for the first chain with insufficient data is being questioned, particularly in the context of the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx
Discussions continue on [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574) regarding the necessity and implications of the injected replacement transaction in interop. The latest comments indicate a growing consensus to simplify the protocol by removing the additional deposit transaction for proofs, especially with the transition to ZK proofs. It's argued that ZK proof generation inherently re-runs the derivation process, making the replacement transaction less critical for identifying original block hashes. While the additional transaction was deemed critical for the fault dispute game to prevent overwhelming honest challengers, its value in a ZK dispute system is being re-evaluated. The next steps involve assigning someone for architectural refactoring and updating the Interop specification to reflect how the Superlayer will generate necessary data without the extra deposit.
