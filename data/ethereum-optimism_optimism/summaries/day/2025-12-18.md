# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on significant upgrades to the deployment pipeline with OPCM v2 support, critical bug fixes in L1 origin selection, and enhancements to dispute game proofs. Several key issues related to ZK-based fault dispute games and interop action tests were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### OPCM v2 Integration and Deployment Enhancements
A major feature was added to support OPCM v2 in the deployment pipeline, allowing conditional routing of deployments through either v1 or v2. This includes new interfaces and contract updates for the `OPContractsManagerV2` and related deployment scripts. Work is also underway to extend `ReadSuperchainDeployment` support for OPCM v2.

### L1 Origin Selection Improvements and Bug Fixes
The L1 origin selection code in `op-node/sequencing` was refactored and fixed. This involved moving core business logic into a pure, unit-tested function, optimizing network calls by utilizing caching, and improving code readability.

### Dispute Game Proofs and Testing Updates
Significant progress was made in dispute game proofs, specifically by adding provable output roots to Super Dispute Games. This requires proposers to provide the preimage of the super root when creating a `SuperFaultDisputeGame`. Additionally, succinct tests were updated to align with project conventions, and a custom `Test` contract was introduced for `makeAddr` to ensure reproducibility.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fault Proof VM and ZK Dispute Game Updates
The FPVM specification was updated to include Go 1.24 features, and unit tests for the `OPSuccinctFaultDisputeGame` contract were added and aligned with project conventions.

### Super Fault Dispute Game Enhancements
The `IDisputeGame.rootClaim(uint256 _l2ChainId)` interface was implemented in `SuperFaultDisputeGame.sol`, requiring the `SuperFaultDisputeGame` to be created with a super root preimage. This also involved updating the proposer to provide the super root preimage when creating these games.

### Interop Action Test Re-enablement
The Kona interop action tests were re-enabled, ensuring their functionality within the CI pipeline.

## NEW ISSUES

### Super Root Provider Review
A new issue was opened to review the correct trace output when the next super root is not found, specifically in the context of the `op-challenger`. The current test for `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` may not be entirely accurate, and there are concerns about the `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC returning "not found" if any chain is not supported by L1.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx
Discussions continue on simplifying the interop specification by removing the additional transaction for replacement blocks. The consensus is leaning towards eliminating the extra deposit transaction for proofs, as it is deemed unnecessary in a ZK proof system where derivation is re-run during proof generation. This simplification would reduce protocol complexity, with the Supernode expected to generate necessary data without the additional deposit. Concerns about the necessity of the additional transaction for the proofs system and potential block gas limit issues were addressed, with the conclusion that the fixed gas cost of the inserted transaction and existing gas reserves mitigate these risks.
