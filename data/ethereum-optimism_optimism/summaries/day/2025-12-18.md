# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the provability of output roots within the SuperFaultDisputeGame and optimizing CI processes for `op-program` to reduce disk usage. A new pull request addresses deployment limits, while a closed issue marks progress on super root preimage provision.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### SuperFaultDisputeGame Enhancements
Significant updates were made to the `SuperFaultDisputeGame` to explicitly require proposers to provide the preimage of the super root when creating a game, ensuring all output roots in the super root are provable. This involves modifications across `op-e2e`, `op-proposer`, and `contracts-bedrock` components. ([#18605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18605))

### CI Optimization for `op-program`
The `preimage-reproducibility` job in CI was optimized to reduce disk usage. This was achieved by implementing a mechanism to delete unused Docker artifacts during the build process, addressing previous failures caused by excessive build artifacts. ([#18641](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18641))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#18642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18642), was opened to address `op-deployer` behavior, specifically to ignore `max-code-size` limits during deployment.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Super Root Preimage Provision
The issue concerning the provision of super root preimages when creating `SuperFaultDisputeGame`s has been closed. This follows up on previous discussions and indicates successful implementation of the required functionality. ([#18521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18521))

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-challenger` Trace Output Review
A new issue, [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18643), has been opened to review the correct trace output in `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found. This specifically concerns a test case where the previous super root is known, but the subsequent one is missing, and all steps are expected to result in an `InvalidTransitionHash`.
