# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the security and ownership transfer mechanisms within the `contracts-bedrock` package, specifically around Safe modules. Several new pull requests were opened, indicating active development across various components including batching, configuration, and testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Safe Module Security Enhancements
A significant update was implemented to enhance the security of Safe modules by disabling the LivenessModule2 guard and module upon ownership transfer. This change also includes the removal of the module by iterating through the Safe module list. This work primarily involved modifications within the `contracts-bedrock` package, affecting interfaces, scripts, snapshots, and core Safe contracts. ([#17808](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17808))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#17924](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17924), was opened to address critical throttling RPC errors in `op-batcher` by exiting the process.
- Another PR, [#17923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17923), titled "Test contribute," suggests work related to testing contributions.
- Feature development for `op-up` is underway with [#17922](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17922), which aims to add a custom configuration intent.
- Improvements to `op-acceptance-tests` are being proposed in [#17921](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17921), focusing on flake-shaking and test promotions.
- A new nullable system configuration type is being introduced in `op-service` via [#17920](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17920).
