# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the security and robustness of the Optimism ecosystem, particularly within the `contracts-bedrock` package. A significant update was made to disable the LivenessModule2 guard and module upon ownership transfer, improving the safety of the system. Several new pull requests were opened, addressing areas such as batcher error handling, custom configuration, and testing improvements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Safer Safes and Ownership Transfer Security
A key update was implemented to enhance the security of the `SaferSafes` system. This change ensures that the `LivenessModule2` guard and module are automatically disabled when ownership is transferred to a fallback owner, preventing potential vulnerabilities during ownership changes. This work involved modifications across several contract files and tests within the `contracts-bedrock` package. ([#17808](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17808))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Six new pull requests were opened today, covering a range of topics:
*   [#17924](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17924) proposes that the `op-batcher` process should exit upon encountering critical throttling RPC errors, aiming to improve the stability of the batcher.
*   [#17923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17923) is a test contribution, likely for internal testing purposes.
*   [#17922](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17922) introduces a new feature to `op-up` that allows for custom configuration intents, enhancing flexibility for upgrades.
*   [#17921](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17921) focuses on improving the `op-acceptance-tests` by addressing flakiness and promoting tests, leading to more reliable testing.
*   [#17920](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17920) introduces a nullable system configuration type within `op-service`, potentially offering more robust handling of optional configurations.
*   [#17925](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17925) adds a new test for `Test_ProgramAction_OperatorFeeFixTransition`, indicating work on fee mechanism transitions.
