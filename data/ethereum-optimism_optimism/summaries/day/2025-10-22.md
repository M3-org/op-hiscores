# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing Superchain infrastructure with `op-supernode` integration, refining developer tooling prompts, and improving dispute game testing. Significant progress was also made on Jovian upgrade transactions and L2EL Engine API support for `op-reth`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Infrastructure & Tooling Enhancements
- Integrated `op-supernode` into scheduled Docker publishing and cross-platform builds, expanding Superchain infrastructure capabilities ([#17970](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17970)).
- Added `MinBaseFee` configuration to `L2InitializationConfig` in `op-chain-ops/genesis`, improving genesis configuration flexibility ([#17977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17977)).
- Updated Jovian upgrade transactions in `op-node/rollup/derive`, finalizing bytecode and `daFootprintGasScalar` values ([#17971](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17971)).
- Implemented L2EL Engine API support for `op-reth` in `op-devstack`, enabling direct interaction with proper authentication ([#17964](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17964)).

### Developer Experience & Testing Improvements
- Refactored AI engineering prompts to include explicit commit strategies and improved test quality guidance, streamlining development workflows ([#17950](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17950)).
- Added runtime batcher flushing instructions to `op-batcher` documentation, aiding manual data posting to the DA layer ([#17967](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17967)).
- Enhanced `OPContractsManager_UpdatePrestate_Test` to verify `disputegame-v2` parameters when the `DEPLOY_V2_DISPUTE_GAMES` feature flag is enabled ([#17956](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17956)).
- Reduced CircleCI parallelism for `go-tests` jobs from 3 to 2 to optimize resource usage ([#17988](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17988), [#17974](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17974)).

### Protocol Security & Smart Contract Refinements
- Addressed a potential reentrancy vector in `LivenessModule2` within `packages/contracts-bedrock`, enhancing contract security ([#17975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17975)).
- Updated Natspec documentation in `SaferSafes` contracts for improved clarity and auditor review ([#17976](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17976)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Jovian Upgrade & Configuration Finalization
- The `Jovian` upgrade transactions' bytecode has been finalized and updated, resolving [#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/772).
- The default `daFootprintGasScalar` value for `Jovian` has been settled at 400, closing [#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/773).
- `MinBaseFee` configuration has been added to `op-chain-ops/genesis` for `Jovian`, addressing [#17862](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17862).

### Dispute Game V2 Integration & Testing
- The `opcm` has been updated to migrate the `Super Dispute Game` to the creator pattern, ensuring compatibility with `dispute-game v2` and closing [#17972](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17972).
- The use of `v2` dispute game contracts in `OPContractsManager.updatePrestate` has been implemented and feature-flagged, resolving [#17261](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17261).
- Action tests for `op-program` have been ensured to pass for `Jovian`, closing [#17302](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17302).

### Development Environment & Validation Process Improvements
- The issue regarding a Sepolia ETH faucet in the Protocol R&D Discord has been closed as the team is moving away from Discord for account funding, resolving [#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12952).
- The ability to use local `op-geth` builds in Kurtosis has been closed as the team is no longer investing in Kurtosis, addressing [#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16975).
- The issue of rewiring `interopgen` config has been closed as `interopgen` is only used by `op-e2e` and new tests are now added as acceptance tests, resolving [#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17614).
- Validation checks on PRs for changes to validation test code/expectations have been closed, as the team moved to chain reports instead of blocking validations, resolving [#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/689).
- The issue of not running genesis validation checks for frontier chains has been closed, as the team moved to a report-based approach rather than relying on validations, resolving [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/696).

## NEW ISSUES

### Dispute Game & Protocol Upgrades
- A new issue has been opened to migrate the `Super Dispute Game` to the creator pattern within `opcm`, ensuring full compatibility with `dispute-game v2` for the next `OPCM` upgrade ([#17972](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17972)).
- An issue has been created to ensure that `StandardValidator` checks `Cannon Kona` game parameters ([#17989](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17989)).
- A new issue outlines the need to tag RCs, generate prestate, and prepare details for a governance post related to `U17` releases and proofs ([#17982](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17982)).

### Security & Testing Infrastructure
- An issue has been raised to upgrade to `quic-go >=0.49` to resolve `CVE-2025-59530`, a high-severity vulnerability identified in `op-node` and `optimism`'s `go.mod` ([#17979](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17979)).
- A new issue proposes to matrix the `Jovian` tests across `Pectra` and `Fusaka L1s` in `op-acceptance-tests`, as they currently only execute against a `Pectra L1` ([#17980](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17980)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `OPContractsManagerStandardValidator` Updates
- [#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17267) is reopened because tests are still skipped when `V2` is enabled, despite previous work. The issue focuses on updating `OPContractsManagerStandardValidator` to handle new dispute game contracts, as some data for `v2` contracts is no longer directly accessible.

### DA Footprint Limit Investigation
- [#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17946) is investigating why the block right after genesis still has a 0 gas scalar. The issue has been found to be caused by how the first block's L1 block attributes were populated from the genesis `SystemConfig`, which may have a 0 scalar that was not translated. A fix is in progress.
