# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the OP Stack with new features like `op-supernode` publishing, refining developer tooling prompts, and improving testing for dispute games. Significant progress was also made on Jovian upgrade transactions and L2EL Engine API support for `op-reth`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Infrastructure & Tooling Improvements
- Added `op-supernode` to scheduled Docker publishing and cross-platform builds, expanding its availability and integration within the Superchain ecosystem ([#17970](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17970)).
- Refactored AI engineering prompts to include explicit commit strategies and improve test quality guidance, streamlining development workflows ([#17950](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17950)).
- Updated Jovian upgrade transactions and added `MinBaseFee` to `L2InitializationConfig` in `op-chain-ops/genesis`, crucial for the upcoming network upgrade ([#17971](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17971), [#17977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17977)).

### Enhanced Testing and CI/CD Optimization
- Improved testing for v2 dispute games by checking game arguments after `opcm.updatePrestate`, ensuring correct parameter setup when the `DEPLOY_V2_DISPUTE_GAMES` feature flag is enabled ([#17956](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17956)).
- Reduced parallelism for `go-tests` jobs in CircleCI from 3 to 2 to optimize resource usage and prevent runner exhaustion ([#17988](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17988), [#17974](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17974)).

### Developer Experience and Protocol Security
- Added runtime batcher flushing instructions to the `op-batcher` documentation, providing clearer guidance for manually posting data to the DA layer ([#17967](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17967)).
- Integrated L2EL Engine API support for `op-reth` in `op-devstack`, enabling direct interaction with proper authentication ([#17964](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17964)).
- Addressed a potential reentrancy vector in `LivenessModule2` and updated Natspec in `SaferSafes` for improved contract security and clarity ([#17975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17975), [#17976](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17976)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dispute Game V2 Integration and Testing
- The issue of using v2 dispute game contracts in `OPCM.updatePrestate` has been resolved, with the functionality now feature-flagged ([#17261](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17261)).
- The migration of Super Dispute Game to the creator pattern, a prerequisite for making `DEPLOY_V2_DISPUTE_GAMES` the default, has been completed ([#17972](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17972)).

### Jovian Upgrade Preparations
- The `minBaseFee` configuration has been added to `L2InitializationConfig` in `op-chain-ops/genesis` for the Jovian upgrade ([#17862](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17862)).
- The Jovian upgrade transactions' bytecode has been updated following finalization of specs and `op-node` changes ([#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/772)).
- The default value for `daFootprintGasScalar` for Jovian has been finalized and updated to 400 ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/773)).
- Action tests for `op-program` for Jovian have been ensured to be passing ([#17302](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17302)).

### Developer Tooling and Validation Streamlining
- The issue regarding the ability to use local `op-geth` builds with Kurtosis has been closed as Kurtosis is no longer being invested in ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16975)).
- The need to validate all chains on PRs modifying validation test code has been closed, as the project has moved to chain reports instead of blocking validations ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/689)).
- Genesis validation checks for frontier chains are no longer run, reducing overhead for chain operators ([#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/696)).
- The issue to rewire `interopgen` config was closed as "won't fix" since `interopgen` is only used by `op-e2e` and new tests are now added as acceptance tests ([#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17614)).
- The Sepolia ETH faucet issue has been closed as account funding is now in-scope for devnet efforts, moving away from Discord ([#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12952)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Security and Infrastructure Upgrades
- An issue has been opened to upgrade `quic-go` to version >=0.49 to resolve CVE-2025-59530, a high-severity vulnerability ([#17979](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17979)).
- A new issue addresses the need for `StandardValidator` changes for Kona + Cannon to ensure correct checking of game parameters ([#17989](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17989)).

### Testing and Release Management
- A new issue proposes to matrix the Jovian tests across Pectra and Fusaka L1s in `op-acceptance-tests` to ensure broader compatibility ([#17980](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17980)).
- An issue has been created for proofs related to U17 releases, prestate generation, and governance post preparation ([#17982](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17982)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game Contract Validation
- **[#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17267) Update OPCMStandardValidator to handle new dispute game contracts:** This issue was initially closed but has been reopened because tests are still being skipped when V2 dispute games are enabled. The `OPContractsManagerStandardValidator` needs to be updated to correctly handle data from version 2 of the dispute game contracts, as some data is no longer accessible in the same way.

### DA Footprint Limit Investigation
- **[#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17946) [DA Footprint Limit] Investigate why block right after genesis still has 0 gas scalar:** An investigation is underway to understand why the block immediately following genesis still shows a 0 gas scalar, when it should have the default scalar. The issue has been identified as related to how the first block's L1 block attributes were populated from the genesis SystemConfig, which may have had a 0 scalar that was not translated. A fix is being implemented in PR #17947.
