## NEW ISSUES
A new issue was opened today:
*   **Flashblocks Enablement on op-sepolia**
    *   [#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16496) proposes enabling flashblocks non-publicly on op-sepolia after gaining confidence from their enablement in eris-0. The initial step would involve deploying flashblocks in `dry_run` mode for testing. This issue was later closed on 2025-07-21 in favor of a milestone creation and is currently blocked by [#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16468).
