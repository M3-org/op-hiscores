# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 23, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on optimizing test performance, enhancing testing infrastructure for sync and fault proofs, and refining contract deployment assertions. Several issues related to interop SuperSystem DA types and deployment configurations were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Test Performance and Infrastructure Improvements
Significant strides were made in optimizing test execution and expanding testing capabilities. A new feature was added to speed up `op-acceptance-tests` by improving Forge build steps, avoiding unnecessary test contract artifacts, and enabling intelligent rebuilds ([#16784](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16784)). Additionally, scaffolding for `op-sync-tester` was introduced, including session handling, configuration loading from YAML, and initial boot functionality ([#16780](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16780)). The `cannon` project also saw progress with the migration of more tests to the `DiffTester` framework, enhancing post-step checks ([#16787](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16787)).

### Contract Deployment Assertions Refinement
Several pull requests focused on streamlining and removing redundant assertions within the `contracts-bedrock` deployment scripts. This includes removing unnecessary/duplicate system config assertions ([#16585](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16585)), as well as assertions related to `l1erc721bridge` ([#16716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16716)), dispute game factory ([#16717](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16717)), and optimism mintable erc20 factory ([#16719](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16719)).

### Interoperability and Monitoring Enhancements
The `op-e2e` suite was updated to support blob Data Availability (DA) types for the interop supersystem, allowing the batcher to be configured for blob-based data posting ([#16788](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16788)). Furthermore, `dispute-mon` was enhanced to support multiple supervisor RPCs, improving its robustness and reliability ([#16517](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16517)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#16797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16797) OP contracts
- [#16798](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16798) Remove proxyAdmin input from the OpChainConfig struct
- [#16801](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16801) op-batcher: separate metrics and logic

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interoperability and Data Availability
The issue concerning configurable DA types for the interop SuperSystem in `op-e2e` was closed ([#15406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15406)). This issue, which aimed to allow the batcher to post batches via blobs instead of calldata, was initially closed incorrectly by automation but then reopened. It has now been resolved by the implementation of blob DA type support.

### Sync Tester Development
The issue tracking session handling and middleware for the `op-sync-tester` was closed ([#16699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16699)). This issue focused on enabling the sync tester to maintain stateful information through sessions, initialized via a dedicated endpoint.

### Infrastructure Deployment
The issue related to deploying a flashblocks-websocket-proxy in op-sepolia was closed ([#16686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16686)). This deployment aimed to expose flashblocks functionality if all active sequencers in op-sepolia were flashblocks-enabled.

## NEW ISSUES
- [#1701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1701) [2024 Q4 Audit] [page-path]

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Code Style and Semgrep Rules
Issue [#15115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15115), "Add semgrep rule for private/internal functions," remains active. The latest comment from `copilot-swe-agent` indicates an error encountered while attempting to work on the issue, specifically that GitHub Actions is disabled for the repository. The agent requests that the issue be unassigned and then re-assigned after the GitHub Actions issue is resolved.

### Test Target Setup and Teardown
Issue [#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/375), "Incorporate test target setup / teardown as an op-acceptor concern," is still open. The most recent comment from `teddyknox` (dated 2025-08-21) indicates that the issue is being closed as Kurtosis is no longer considered important for network testing compared to Sysgo. However, a previous comment from `scharissis` (dated 2025-07-23) provided related pull requests, suggesting ongoing work or discussions around this topic.
