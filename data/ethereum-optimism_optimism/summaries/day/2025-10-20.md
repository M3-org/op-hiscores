# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant bug fixes in the build system and testing infrastructure, alongside stylistic improvements to SaferSafes contracts. Several new pull requests were opened, focusing on testing, acceptance tests, and Superchain components.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Build System and CI Enhancements
Critical fixes were implemented to improve the stability and reliability of the build and continuous integration processes. This included removing Makefile sharding in favor of in-test sharding for `op-e2e` tests and fixing the version of `mise` used in Docker builds to ensure consistent environments.
- [#17930](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17930)
- [#17954](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17954)

### SaferSafes Contract Improvements
Stylistic changes were made to the `LivenessModule2` and `TimelockGuard` contracts within the SaferSafes suite, aiming for better alignment and readability.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A total of 19 new pull requests were opened, covering a wide range of topics including:
- **Testing and Acceptance Tests:** Multiple PRs focus on enhancing testing, such as checking game arguments after `opcm.updatePrestate` for v2 games ([#17956](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17956)), re-enabling tests for v2 contracts and validating proposers in `opcm-standard-validator` ([#17955](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17955)), hardening blob base fee calculation tests ([#17953](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17953)), improving the SaferSafes test suite ([#17949](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17949)), adding a Jovian DA footprint test ([#17947](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17947)), and various improvements to the Fusaka acceptance test ([#17944](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17944)).
- **Superchain Components:** PRs related to `op-supernode` activity ([#17952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17952)), fixing gossip validation for Jovian blocks in `op-node` ([#17940](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17940)), and ensuring HTTP response bodies are closed in error cases for `op-alt-da` ([#17948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17948)).
- **Developer Experience and Refactoring:** A PR to add commit strategy and improve test quality guidance in `prompt` ([#17950](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17950)), and improvements to L1FeeVault test coverage ([#17934](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17934)).

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
Six new issues were opened, highlighting areas for improvement and investigation:
- **Dispute Game System:** An issue was raised to update OPCM functions to use a new creator pattern for forwards-compatible gameType retrieval ([#17933](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17933)).
- **Sequencer Functionality:** A bug was reported where `sequencer.max-safe-lag` is not working as expected in `op-node` ([#17936](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17936)).
- **Developer Tooling:** Discussions are ongoing to improve `op-up` to serve as a `sysgo` runner for local development, potentially replacing Kurtosis ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17942)).
- **Observability and Monitoring:** A feature request was made to enable observability and monitoring in `sysgo` for long-running devnets, particularly for the Rust protocol team ([#17941](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17941)).
- **DA Footprint Limit:** Two issues were opened related to the DA Footprint Limit, one to add action proof tests ([#17945](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17945)) and another to investigate why block 1 after genesis still has a 0 gas scalar ([#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17946)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **[DA Footprint Limit] Complete implementation** ([#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17551)): The implementation of the DA Footprint Limit is considered blocked by the investigation into why block 1 after genesis still has a 0 gas scalar, as this is a spec derivation issue.
- **jovian: do not marshal new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active** ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17907)): There's an ongoing discussion about whether to update `op-succinct/kailua` directly or to add a nullable system config to avoid breaking zk stacks that use `rollupConfig` for commitment hashing. The general sentiment leans towards not updating APIs in an uncoordinated way.
