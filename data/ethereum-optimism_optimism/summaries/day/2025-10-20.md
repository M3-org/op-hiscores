# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on bug fixes, particularly in the build process and test infrastructure, alongside significant styling improvements to SaferSafes contracts. Several new pull requests were opened, covering testing, refactoring, and further improvements to the Superchain.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Build Process and CI Enhancements
Efforts were made to streamline the build process and ensure consistency in CI environments. This included removing Makefile sharding to rely on in-test sharding for `op-e2e` tests and fixing the `mise` version used in Golang Docker builds to improve stability and control over the build environment.

- [#17954](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17954)

### SaferSafes Contract Styling Alignment
Significant stylistic changes were implemented to align the `LivenessModule2` and `TimelockGuard` contracts with the overall `SaferSafes` styling. This work involved modifications across multiple contract files and their associated tests, enhancing code consistency and readability.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A variety of new pull requests were opened, focusing on testing, refactoring, and specific feature enhancements. These include:

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
Several new issues were opened, highlighting areas for improvement and investigation:
- **Game Type Retrieval and `op-node` Bug:** An issue was raised regarding forwards-compatible gameType retrieval in OPCM, suggesting an update to OPCM functions that read game types from dispute game implementations ([#17933](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17933)). Additionally, a bug was reported where `sequencer.max-safe-lag` in `op-node` is not functioning as expected ([#17936](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17936)).
- **Developer Tooling and Observability:** Discussions began on improving `op-up` to serve as a `sysgo` runner for local development, potentially replacing Kurtosis for spinning up local devnets ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17942)). There's also a feature request to enable observability and monitoring in `sysgo` for long-running devnet instances, particularly for the Rust protocol team ([#17941](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17941)).
- **DA Footprint Limit Investigations:** Two issues were opened related to the DA Footprint Limit: one to add action proof tests ([#17945](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17945)) and another to investigate why the block right after genesis still has a 0 gas scalar, which should ideally have the default scalar ([#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17946)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **[DA Footprint Limit] Complete implementation** ([#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17551)): The implementation of the DA Footprint Limit is currently blocked by the investigation into why block 1 after genesis still has a 0 gas scalar, as this is considered a spec derivation.
- **jovian: do not marshal new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active** ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17907)): Discussion revolves around whether to update `op-succinct/kailua` directly or to add a nullable system config to avoid breaking zk stacks that use the rollup configuration for commitment hashing. The possibility of justifying the change based on not updating APIs in an uncoordinated way is being considered.
