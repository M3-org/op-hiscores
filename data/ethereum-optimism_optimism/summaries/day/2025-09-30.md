# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 30, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the `op-node`'s EngineController for improved stability and adding new testing infrastructure. Flashblocks were successfully enabled on op-mainnet, marking a significant milestone.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Engine Controller Stability and Refactoring
The `op-node`'s EngineController underwent significant refactoring to improve its internal logic and ensure proper locking mechanisms for concurrent operations. This work aims to enhance the stability and correctness of the execution layer synchronization process. ([#17647](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17647), [#17648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17648))

### Expanded Testing and CI Improvements
New testing infrastructure was introduced, including nightly Kurtosis tests for `op-acceptance-tests` to prevent blocking PRs and a script to validate semantic versioning in `contracts-bedrock`. Additionally, CI now ensures consistent Forge versions across `op-deployer` and the development environment. ([#17658](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17658), [#17641](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17641), [#17670](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17670))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Enabled on op-mainnet
Flashblocks have been successfully enabled on op-mainnet, a major step forward for preconfirmations. This achievement followed a progressive rollout and thorough testing. ([#16498](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16498))

### Flashblocks Documentation and Onboarding Completed
Documentation and onboarding for Flashblocks were completed, including an internal session for on-call teams and a public blog post detailing the Flashblocks deployment and learnings. ([#17142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17142), [#17664](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17664))

### EL Sync Correctness Issue Resolved
A synchronization issue within the `op-node`'s execution layer sync code path, particularly concerning the EngineController's parallelism, has been addressed and resolved. ([#17564](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17564))

## NEW ISSUES

### Documentation for op-sync-tester
There is a new issue to update the `op-sync-tester` README with its current implementation. ([#17667](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17667))
