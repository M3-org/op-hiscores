### RPC Response Content Type Issue
*   **[#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/389) OP Chain A and B rpc response for eth rpc queries is missing content type**: This issue, opened on April 23, 2025, reports that RPC responses for `eth` queries from OP Chain A and B are missing the `Content-Type` header. The latest comment from Hazimehhassan on August 23, 2025, at 17:40:02Z, is a mention to "@smartcontracts". Previously, OBlackmon3 on August 20, 2025, asked how to suggest a fix, and OscBacon on April 23, 2025, noted that this might be causing issues with how Wagmi reads `eth_getTransactionReceipt`.
