# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on optimizing the `op-batcher` for improved memory efficiency and throughput, alongside significant documentation updates for security reviews. Several long-standing issues were closed, indicating progress on various technical debts and interop-related tasks. New issues primarily revolve around the deployment and testing of "flashblocks" functionality.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Batcher Performance Enhancements
The `op-batcher` received critical performance improvements aimed at reducing memory consumption and accelerating block processing. Changes include discarding the channel compressor after frames are generated, leading to a "massive reduction in memory usage" when processing backlogs ([#16597](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16597)). Additionally, the batcher will now start publishing and throttling sooner when loading a backlog of blocks, addressing potential throughput issues during restarts ([#16648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16648)).

### Security Documentation Updates
Two new Spearbit security review reports for May and July 2025 were added to the documentation. These reports cover the Upgrade 16 and VerifyOPCM security reviews, enhancing transparency and providing up-to-date security information ([#16737](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16737)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#16768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16768) [WIP] - enable tracing in op-node
- [#16770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16770) fix: typos in PreimageOracle.sol

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interoperability and Supervisor Enhancements
A significant number of issues related to interop functionality and the `op-supervisor` were closed. This includes investigations into recovering RC Alpha testnets ([#15702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15702)), client follow-ups for RC Beta test runs ([#15755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15755)), and various `op-supervisor` readiness and RPC improvements ([#15757](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15757), [#15758](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15758)). Metrics for reorgs ([#15762](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15762)), upgrade countdown polish ([#15763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15763)), and activation block reorg support ([#15774](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15774)) were also addressed. Issues concerning dependency set configuration ([#16084](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16084)) and `resetTracker` todos ([#16026](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16026)) for the supervisor were closed.

### Batcher and Node Optimization & Refinement
Several issues focused on optimizing the `op-batcher` and `op-node` components. This includes a spike to optimize `op-batcher` memory consumption ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16537)), increasing observability of its memory usage ([#16572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16572)), and fixing channel duration tracking discrepancies ([#10924](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10924)). `op-node` improvements include increasing `MaxFrameLength` and checking buffer size ([#10470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10470)), investigating `Peek/Discard io.Reader` in `BatchReader` ([#10522](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10522)), and addressing an infinite loop on missing L1 origin ([#10923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10923)).

### General Development and CI/CD Improvements
A range of general development and CI/CD related issues were closed. This includes speeding up CI and Git by enforcing index-version 4 ([#10486](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10486)), adding generic fork flag and field tests ([#10909](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10909)), and abstracting/removing duplicate code across `check-hardfork` scripts ([#10914](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10914)). Other closed issues cover `op-service` logger setup deduplication ([#10931](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10931)), adding batch `BlockByNumber` to client ([#10933](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10933)), and improving `txmgr` logs with `nonce` attributes ([#10937](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10937)).

### Pectra Support and Flashblocks Readiness
Progress on Pectra support was tracked and closed ([#12435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12435)). Issues related to flashblocks readiness, such as enabling flashblocks non-publicly on op-sepolia ([#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16496)) and a reth-enabled flashblocks node ([#16544](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16544)), were closed, indicating a shift towards active deployment and testing.

## NEW ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Testing Strategy
A series of new issues outline the phased deployment and testing strategy for "flashblocks" functionality. This includes enabling flashblocks on a single production mainnet sequencer for initial evaluation ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16759)), followed by load testing on devnets ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16756)). Subsequent steps involve enabling flashblocks on remaining OP Labs sequencers ([#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16760)) and Sunnyside sequencers ([#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16761)).

### Flashblocks Infrastructure and Monitoring
New issues also cover the necessary infrastructure and monitoring for flashblocks. This includes setting up alerting for flashblocks production issues ([#16762](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16762)), deploying a `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` ([#16763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16763)), and deploying `flashblocks-rpc` nodes ([#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16764)). Partner support criteria evaluation on `eris-0` is also a key focus ([#16765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16765)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Supervisor Unsafe Target Improvement
Issue [#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16314) discusses improving the `op-supervisor`'s reset unsafe target. The latest comments indicate that much of the actionable work has been completed, particularly with PR [#16557](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16557). The discussion now centers on whether any further actions are needed, given upcoming refactoring of these components. The issue was closed today, with a note to re-open or create a new issue if necessary, suggesting that the current scope of improvements has been met.
