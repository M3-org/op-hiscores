## NEW ISSUES
### op-proposer Configuration Issues
* A new issue [#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13502) was opened regarding the `op-proposer` failing to create a transaction, specifically encountering an `execution reverted` error. The issue highlights a problem with deploying `op-proposer` using a specific command and private key.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-proposer Transaction Failure
The issue [#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13502) is active and discusses the `op-proposer` failing to create transactions. The latest comment from `dariusL3` (Aug 26, 2025) suggests that upgrading the game factory address proxy implementation and setting the correct `--game-type` (specifically `1` for `PermissionedFaultDisputeGame` when deploying with `op-deployer`) resolved the issue. This confirms an earlier suggestion by `mw2000` (Feb 7, 2025). `asymmetric` (Feb 25, 2025) also investigated the `gameImpls` mapping not being initialized for game types `0` and `1`. `protolambda` (Feb 4, 2025) initially pointed to a `NoImplementation` error, suggesting misconfigured contracts or `op-proposer` with the wrong game-type.
