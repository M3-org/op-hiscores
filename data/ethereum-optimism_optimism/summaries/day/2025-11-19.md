# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `op-deployer` by recording version information in intent and state files, improving deployer visibility. Several new pull requests were opened, addressing various technical improvements and documentation. A key issue regarding `min-base-fee` simulations was closed, while a new issue was opened to track OPCM v2 test replacements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhancing Deployer Version Tracking
The `op-deployer` now records its version in intent and state files, addressing a previous loss of information when contract locators were modified. This change improves visibility into deployed contracts. ([#18333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18333))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#18331](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18331) proposes using `vm.prank(address,bool)` for delegateCall, aiming to remove the `DelegateCaller` contract.
*   [#18330](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18330) addresses a CI fix by adding branch restrictions and label overrides for artifact fallback.
*   [#18329](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18329) suggests enforcing deterministic shell script formatting using `shfmt`.
*   [#18328](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18328) adds the CGT audit report to the documentation.
*   [#18327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18327) aims to fix `MaxChannelDuration` tracking for large block backlogs in `op-batcher`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Min-Base-Fee Feature Evaluation
The issue concerning simulations to prove the effectiveness of the `min-base-fee` feature has been closed ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16958)). The current approach is to observe the feature's performance in production.

## NEW ISSUES

### OPCM v2 Test Coverage
A new issue has been opened to track the replacement or fixing of all tests currently skipped when OPCM v2 is enabled ([#18332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18332)). This aims to ensure comprehensive test coverage for OPCM v2.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Documenting Cannon Kona Prestate Requirement
Discussion on [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18095) continues regarding the documentation of the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades. The latest update indicates that the docs team has received a one-pager mentioning the need to provide a Kona prestate, and there's an agreement with devrel to highlight this requirement in the Optimism documentation, especially for the U18 upgrade.
