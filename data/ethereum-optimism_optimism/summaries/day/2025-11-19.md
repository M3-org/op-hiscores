# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 19, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing documentation with a new audit report, improving deployment tooling by recording version information, and addressing critical issues related to VM compatibility and batcher functionality.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation and Security Audits
A new audit report for the Custom Gas Token was added to the security reviews documentation, enhancing transparency and providing crucial security insights for the project [#18328](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18328).

### Deployment Tooling Enhancements
The `op-deployer` tool was updated to record `opDeployerVersion` in both intent and state files. This change addresses a loss of information regarding deployed contracts after modifications to state/intent contract locators, improving traceability and debugging capabilities [#18333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18333).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A pull request was opened to use `vm.prank(address,bool)` for delegateCall and remove the `DelegateCaller` contract [#18331](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18331).
- Another pull request aims to fix `MaxChannelDuration` tracking for large block backlogs within the `op-batcher` [#18327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18327).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Min-Base-Fee Feature Evaluation
The issue concerning simulations to prove the effectiveness of the `min-base-fee` feature has been closed [#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16958). The current approach is to observe the feature's performance in a production environment.

## NEW ISSUES

### Testing and VM Compatibility
- A general tracking ticket was created to address skipped tests when OPCM v2 is enabled, aiming to either fix or add replacement tests [#18332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18332).
- An issue was reported regarding the `op-program`'s `vm-compat` failing to analyze go1.25 binaries due to an unhandled modification of a register in an r-type instruction [#18334](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18334).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Documentation of `cannonKonaPrestate` Requirement
Discussion on documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18095) continues. The latest update indicates that the docs team has received a one-pager mentioning the need to provide a Kona prestate, following earlier discussions with devrel about highlighting this requirement for the U18 upgrade.
