# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining contract management, enhancing CI stability, and improving developer tooling. Key updates include OPCM V2 verification, CI test fixes, and a new `op-chain-ops` command for output root calculation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Contracts and Protocol Enhancements
Support for OPCM V2 has been integrated into the `VerifyOPCM` script, ensuring backward compatibility with V1. The OPCM V2 version has also been bumped to 7.0.0, indicating ongoing development and refinement of the Optimism Contracts Manager.
- [#18590](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18590)
- [#18631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18631)

### CI/CD and Developer Tooling Improvements
A critical bug in the contracts test-upgrade CI job was fixed, resolving issues with malformed JUnit XML reports. Additionally, the `op-chain-ops` tool now includes a command to calculate an output root directly from an EL endpoint, which is useful for validating output roots against RPC provider services.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#18639](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18639) proposes requiring two contract owners to modify the `CODEOWNERS` file, enhancing security.
- [#18638](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18638) and [#18630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18630) both aim to validate EIP-1559 parameters within the `op-node` derivation pipeline.
- [#18636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18636) suggests a chore to use `tool_alias` instead of `alias` in `mise` configuration.
- [#18634](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18634) introduces a feature to update upgrade test blocks weekly.
- [#18632](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18632) addresses a bug by applying deployment overrides when checking custom intent.
- [#18629](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18629) adds `just` recipes for `devnet-up` and `devnet-down`.
- [#18628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18628) focuses on `op-sync-tester` to support `engine_exchangeCapabilities`.
- [#18627](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18627) enables `op-devstack` to support Kona light CL.
- [#18624](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18624) removes the Go 1.24 feature flag, keeping the `SysGetRandom` syscall enabled.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation and Release Process
The requirement for `cannonKonaPrestate` in upgrades has been documented, clarifying a crucial aspect for standard chains. Additionally, a policy and procedure for the release process has been drafted and completed.

- [#18592](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18592)

## NEW ISSUES

### Upgrade and Artifact Management
A new issue highlights the need to update `op-deployer` to include an artifacts URL for `v7_0_0` once they are stored remotely, ensuring proper resource location for upgrades.
- [#18633](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18633)

### Game Type and EIP-1559 Parameter Validation
Discussions have begun on setting `CANNON_KONA` as the default respected game type, transitioning it from a fallback to a primary option. Another issue addresses the need for `op-node` to check for a zero elasticity multiplier in EIP-1559 parameters, despite existing contract-level guarantees.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interoperability and Replacement Transactions
Discussion on [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574) revolves around reworking injected replacement transactions for interop. The latest comments suggest simplifying the protocol by eliminating the additional deposit transaction for proofs, with the Supernode generating necessary data. Concerns about consensus checks and data availability for challengers were raised, but it's believed these risks diminish with ZK proofs. The consensus leans towards simplifying the protocol and updating the Interop specification.

### Node Synchronization and Trie Node Errors
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581) continues to address node synchronization problems, specifically "missing trie node" errors. The latest comments indicate the user is running a full node with OP-GETH and has experienced data corruption. The user is considering switching to Reth and is seeking guidance on obtaining snapshots. The discussion highlights the importance of checking for unclean shutdowns, using full sync mode, and ensuring sufficient disk IOPS.

### Proofs Action Testing and Supernodes
The SPIKE to rework Proofs Action Testing to support Supernodes in [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18621) is actively being discussed. The latest comments question whether action tests are overkill for testing the proof program and suggest that testing the `op-challenger` for interop might require more intrusive scenarios. The discussion also explores whether testing the actual Supernode implementation could simplify proof testing by running `op-program` against its chain state.

### File-Relative Paths vs. Project-Relative Paths
The long-standing issue [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10202) regarding the use of file-relative paths instead of project-relative paths saw recent activity. A user confirmed that context-aware remappings solved their issue, with a suggestion for specific remapping configurations. Earlier discussions highlighted the challenges with project-relative paths in tools like Remix and Foundry, and the trade-offs between refactoring ease and portability.
