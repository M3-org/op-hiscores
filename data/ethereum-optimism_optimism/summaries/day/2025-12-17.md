# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing contract verification, improving CI stability, and adding new `op-chain-ops` functionality. Key updates include OPCM V2 support and a new command for output root calculation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Contract Verification and Management Updates
Significant progress was made in contract verification and management. Support for OPCM V2 was added to `VerifyOPCM`, ensuring compatibility with both V1 and V2 of the Optimism Contracts Manager. The OPCM V2 version was also bumped to 7.0.0.

- [#18631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18631)

### CI and Tooling Enhancements
The CI pipeline saw improvements with a fix for malformed JUnit XML reports in the `contracts-test-upgrade` job. Additionally, the `op-chain-ops` tool gained a new command to calculate an output root from an Execution Layer endpoint, aiding in the verification of output roots against RPC provider services.

- [#18626](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18626)

### Code Ownership and Maintenance
The `CODEOWNERS` file was updated to include the platforms team as codeowners for `op-deployer` and `op-validator`, streamlining maintenance and responsibility.

## NEW ISSUES

### Upgrade Artifacts and Game Type Defaults
New issues include the need to update `op-deployer` with an artifacts URL for `v7_0_0` once stored remotely. There's also a plan to change the default respected game type to `CANNON_KONA` after Upgrade 18, making it the primary game type.

### EIP-1559 Parameter Validation
A new issue proposes checking for a zero elasticity multiplier in EIP-1559 parameters within the `op-node`, despite existing guarantees in `SystemConfig.sol`.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### File-Relative Paths vs. Project-Relative Paths
Discussion continues on [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10202) regarding the use of file-relative paths instead of project-relative paths. The latest comments suggest that context-aware remappings could resolve compilation issues, with an example provided for Foundry. The debate centers on portability versus refactoring ease, with some arguing that file-relative paths are more portable and widely adopted in other projects like OpenZeppelin.

### Interop: Evaluating and Reworking Injected Replacement Transactions
On [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574), the conversation revolves around simplifying the interop protocol by potentially removing the additional deposit transaction for proofs. There's a consensus that the replacement transaction is unnecessary for ZK proofs, as the ZK program execution inherently re-runs derivation. The Supernode's ability to generate necessary data for proof without an extra deposit is being considered to simplify the protocol, with a focus on updating the Interop specification.

### Node Synchronization Issues
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581) addresses "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors, indicating an incomplete or corrupted state database in the L1 Execution Client. Users are reporting similar issues with `op-geth` and snapshots. Debugging efforts are focused on clarifying client configurations (full vs. archive node), checking for unclean shutdowns, and providing full logs and client flags. The possibility of switching to Reth or using `syncmode=full` is also being discussed.

### Reworking Proofs Action Testing for Supernodes
Discussion on [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18621) centers on adapting proofs action testing to the Supernode architecture. The key question is how to test the actual Supernode implementation effectively. There's a strong sentiment that tests should run against a "real" Supernode to validate the interaction between the challenger and Supernode. While the current action test framework has flaws, the goal is to find an approach that works best for Supernode scenarios, potentially by rewriting tests to fit a new approach rather than forcing Supernode into the existing framework. The importance of testing the `op-challenger` for interop and how the Supernode might record blocks that fail interop validity checks are also being considered.
