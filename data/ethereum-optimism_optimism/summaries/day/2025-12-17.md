# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing contract verification, improving CI stability, and adding new `op-chain-ops` functionality. Key updates include OPCM V2 support and a new command for output root calculation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Contract Verification and Management Updates
Significant work was done to integrate and verify OPCM V2, ensuring continued support for OPCM V1. This involved updating interfaces, scripts, and snapshots within the `contracts-bedrock` package. Additionally, the OPCMv2 version was bumped to v7.0.0.
- Added support for OPCM V2 verification while maintaining V1 compatibility ([#18590](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18590))
- Bumped OPCMv2 to version 7.0.0 ([#18631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18631))

### CI/CD and Tooling Improvements
A bug in the contracts test-upgrade CI job was fixed, addressing malformed JUnit XML reports caused by incorrect output redirection. The platforms team was also added as codeowners for `op-deployer` and `op-validator`.
- Fixed malformed JUnit XML reports in contracts test-upgrade CI job ([#18637](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18637))
- Added platforms team as CODEOWNERS for `op-deployer` and `op-validator` ([#18635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18635))

### Chain Operations Enhancements
A new command was added to `op-chain-ops` to calculate an output root directly from an Execution Layer (EL) endpoint. This is useful for validating output roots against RPC provider services that do not expose the `optimism_outputRoot` functionality.
- Added `op-chain-ops` command to calculate output root from an EL endpoint ([#18626](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18626))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation and Release Process Finalization
Two issues related to documentation and release processes were closed today. One focused on documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades, and the other on writing a process/procedure for the release process.
- Documented `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18095))
- Finalized the process/procedure for the release process ([#18592](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18592))

## NEW ISSUES

### Artifact and Game Type Configuration
New issues have been opened to address the need for updating resource locators for `v7_0_0` artifacts and to set the default respected game type to `CANNON_KONA` for future upgrades.
- Update `op-deployer` to include artifact URLs for `v7_0_0` once stored remotely ([#18633](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18633))
- Change the default respected game type to `CANNON_KONA` to be the primary game type after Upgrade 18 ([#18640](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18640))

### EIP-1559 Parameter Validation
An issue was created to ensure that the `op-node` checks for a non-zero elasticity multiplier in EIP-1559 parameters, reinforcing existing contract-level guarantees.
- Ensure `op-node` validates for a non-zero elasticity multiplier in EIP-1559 parameters ([#18625](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18625))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### File-Relative Paths vs. Project-Relative Paths ([#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/10202))
The discussion continues regarding the use of file-relative paths versus project-relative paths in imports. The latest comment from `manu-qiro` indicates that context-aware remappings solved their issue, referencing a previous suggestion by `alexkeating`. This suggests that while project-relative paths are part of the style guide for refactoring ease, they can cause compilation issues for users, which might be mitigated by specific remapping configurations.

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574))
The conversation revolves around simplifying the interop protocol by potentially removing the additional deposit transaction for proofs. `ajsutton` highlights that the additional transaction recording the block hash is critical for the proofs system to avoid overwhelming honest challengers. `rdin777` notes a consensus towards simplifying the protocol by eliminating the extra deposit transaction, suggesting an architectural refactoring and an update to the Interop specification. `Inphi` agrees that the Supernode should be able to generate necessary data for proof, supporting protocol simplification. `axelKingsley` questions the necessity of re-running derivation if the Supernode can supply the data, treating its recorded denylists as a "SafeDB for replacements."

### The Node is Not Synchronized ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581))
Users are reporting issues with nodes not synchronizing, often accompanied by "missing trie node" errors. `yaki-1337` confirmed using a full node without an archive, no improper shutdowns, and `OP-GETH`. They are now asking where to download `OP-GETH` or if it's time to switch to Reth. `rdin777` previously suggested that "missing trie node" errors indicate an incomplete or corrupted state database and asked for clarification on node type, shutdown history, and execution client. They also recommended trying `--syncmode=full` or checking disk IOPS.

### SPIKE: Rework Proofs Action Testing to Support Supernodes ([#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18621))
The discussion focuses on adapting proofs action testing for the Supernode architecture. `ajsutton` emphasizes that `op-challenger` relies on Supernode for data in production, so tests should reflect this interaction. They also suggest that if Supernode can be tested effectively, `op-program` could verify chain state against it. `Inphi` believes action tests might be overkill for testing only the proof program but sees value for `op-challenger` in interop, especially for generating scenarios for the super STF. They suggest the Supernode could expose records of blocks that fail interop validity checks for testing.
