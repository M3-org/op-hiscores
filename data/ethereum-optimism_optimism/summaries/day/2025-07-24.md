# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 24, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `op-node`'s P2P configuration with a new flag for payload timestamp thresholds and updating `op-acceptance-tests`. Significant refactoring improved L1 bridge test coverage, and new issues were opened concerning event system refactoring, execution multiplexing, and minimum base fees.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### P2P Network Configuration
A new configurable `GossipTimestampThreshold` flag was added to the `op-node` to allow operators to customize the maximum age for rejecting gossip messages with old payload timestamps, improving network flexibility. ([#16718](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16718))

### Test Infrastructure Updates
The `op-acceptance-tests` were updated to `v1.1.1`, ensuring compatibility and leveraging the latest testing features. ([#16802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16802))

### L1 Bridge Test Refinements
Test coverage and quality for both `L1StandardBridge` and `L1ERC721Bridge` were improved through refactoring, utilizing AI assistance with a revised prompt. ([#16772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16772))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened today:
- [#16814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16814) proposes to remove ambiguous uses of the word "pending" within the `op-batcher`.
- [#16816](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16816) aims to refactor the `op-batcher` by moving business logic out of the metrics package.

## CLOSED ISSUES
A short-lived issue regarding an Event System Refactor POC was opened and closed on the same day. ([#16806](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16806))

## NEW ISSUES
### Core Protocol Enhancements
New issues were opened to track significant protocol-level work:
- A Proof of Concept for an Event System Refactor. ([#16806](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16806))
- Tracking for Execution Multiplexing, a key initiative for performance. ([#16809](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16809))
- Tracking for the implementation of a Minimum Base Fee, referencing a ratified design document. ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16807))

### RPC Provider Support
An issue was created to address the need for RPC providers to access `flashblocks-websocket-url` to power their `flashblocks-rpc` nodes. ([#16811](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16811))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerting Improvements
Discussion on [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16388) continues to focus on establishing robust monitoring and alerting for flashblocks integration, especially as op-sepolia approaches enablement. Key points from recent comments include:
- **Metrics for Monitoring:** Specific metrics were outlined, such as minimum peer count (4), SLAs around block progression and divergence, and alerts for pending transactions exceeding thresholds (e.g., ~60).
- **Flashblocks-Specific Metrics:** Suggestions include an SLA-like metric for `reth_op_rbuilder_total_block_built_duration` (p99 over a time interval) and monitoring `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` connections for failures and errors.
- **RPC Node Health:** Metrics for `flashblocks-rpc` node health include tracking upstream errors and message rates, with the absence of these metrics serving as an alert.
- **`op-node-rbuilder`:** This component should inherit most `op-node` alerts and metrics.
- **Associated PRs:** A related PR in the `k8s` repository ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/k8s/pull/7162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/k8s/pull/7162)) was noted.
- **Ongoing Work:** Other in-flight work related to flashblocks was mentioned, including `op-alloy` and another Optimism PR. A draft reth PR was also highlighted for early review.
