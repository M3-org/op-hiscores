# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 30, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes related to contract management and data availability, alongside enhancements for dispute game implementations. Key updates include refining `OPContractsManager` inputs, addressing a max input size bug in the batcher, and adding validation for `CANNON_KONA` games.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Contract Management and Deployment Enhancements
Significant work was done to streamline contract management, including removing redundant `proxyAdmin` inputs from `OPContractsManager` and `StandardValidator` by deriving them from the system configuration. This simplifies deployment processes and fixes related tests ([#17744](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17744)). Additionally, flags were added to `op-deployer` to support new v2 dispute game implementation options ([#18027](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18027)).

### Dispute Game Validation and Bug Fixes
Validation for `CANNON_KONA` games was added to `OPContractsManagerStandardValidator` ([#18050](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18050)), ensuring proper handling of new dispute game types. A follow-up fix addressed remaining failing forge upgrade tests related to the v2 Dispute Game setup ([#18066](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18066)). A new test was also added for the `ProgramAction_OperatorFeeFixTransition` ([#17925](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17925)).

### Data Availability Improvements
A critical bug in `op-batcher` was fixed, exempting generic data availability from max input size limits. This cherry-picks fixes from Celestia to remove frame size restrictions for generic DA types ([#18074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Contract Configuration Simplification
The issue of removing the `proxyAdmin` input from the `OpChainConfig` struct used in `OPContractsManager.upgrade()` was resolved. This field is no longer required as it can be derived from `systemConfigProxy.proxyAdmin()` ([#16729](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16729)).

### Data Availability Fixes
An investigation into upstreaming Celestia's batcher DA size fix was completed, leading to a resolution for issues related to max frame size limits for generic DA types ([#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17872)).

### Dispute Game Validation
The requirement to ensure `StandardValidator` checks Cannon Kona game parameters was addressed and closed ([#17989](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17989)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Deployment and Verification Challenges
A new issue highlights problems with `op-deployer` logs and Etherscan verification on Sepolia, particularly concerning explicit messages for already deployed contracts and potential improvements for verification ([#18089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18089)).

### Batcher Performance and Documentation Gaps
A problem with `op-batcher`'s max channel duration tracking for large block backlogs was identified, impacting how long channels remain open ([#18092](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18092)). Additionally, there's a need to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades, as `opcm.upgrade` doesn't enforce it but standard chains should always set it ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18095)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-deployer` Transaction Gas Limit Issues ([#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17912))
The discussion confirms that the "transaction gas limit too high" error is due to the Fusaka hardfork on Sepolia, which enforces a transaction gas limit of 16,777,216 (EIP-7825). This means large upgrade transactions must be broken down or optimized. It was noted that using an older `op-deployer` version (v0.2.6) might contribute to the issue, and users should consider v0.5.0* for the latest contract release, though its post-Fusaka compatibility is still being tested.

### `op-node`, `op-program`: Skipping L1 Chain Config for L3s ([#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18070))
The conversation revolves around the necessity of providing L1 chain config for `op-node` and `op-program`, especially for L3s. It's suggested that the system should automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID and apply L3 behavior, similar to how it recognizes L1 mainnet and Sepolia, to simplify the process for most L3s.

### Running Acceptance Tests Without the Monorepo ([#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/469))
The ongoing discussion highlights challenges in running acceptance tests outside the monorepo, particularly concerning contract artifacts and the limitations of modifying devnets due to private orchestrator fields. This indicates a need for better tooling or documentation to facilitate external testing.
