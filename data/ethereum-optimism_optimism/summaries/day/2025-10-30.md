# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 30, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes across the OP Stack, including improvements to the batcher's data availability handling and refinements in contract management. Significant progress was also made in enhancing the `OPContractsManagerStandardValidator` for dispute games.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Contract Management and Validation Enhancements
Several bug fixes and updates were implemented to improve the `OPContractsManager` and `OPContractsManagerStandardValidator`. This includes removing redundant `proxyAdmin` inputs from contract management functions, deriving them from the system configuration, and fixing related tests ([#17744](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17744)). Validation for `CANNON_KONA` games was also added to the `OPContractsManagerStandardValidator` ([#18050](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18050)), alongside a fix for the OPCM standard validator test setup for v2 Dispute Games ([#18066](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18066)).

### Batcher Improvements for Data Availability
A critical fix was introduced to the `op-batcher` to exempt generic data availability from maximum input size limits, addressing an issue related to Celestia's fixes for alternative DA types ([#18074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074)).

### Testing Infrastructure and New Test Cases
New tests were added to verify the `ProgramAction_OperatorFeeFixTransition` ([#17925](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17925)). Additionally, the CI configuration for `op-acceptance-tests-kurtosis` was updated to default to the CircleCI runner, providing future protection for test execution ([#18083](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18083)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Contract Management Simplification
The issue of removing the `proxyAdmin` input from the `OpChainConfig` struct used in `OPCM.upgrade()` was resolved ([#16729](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16729)). This input is no longer required as it can now be derived from `systemConfigProxy.proxyAdmin()`.

### Data Availability Fixes
An investigation into upstreaming Celestia's batcher DA size fix was concluded, leading to a resolution for issues related to data availability handling ([#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17872)).

### Dispute Game Validation
The requirement for the `StandardValidator` to check Cannon Kona game parameters was addressed and closed ([#17989](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17989)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Deployment and Verification Challenges
A new issue highlights the need for more explicit logs in `op-deployer` when contracts already exist at the same address and requests Etherscan verification on Sepolia ([#18089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18089)).

### Batcher Max Channel Duration Tracking
A problem was identified in `op-batcher` regarding the tracking of max channel duration, particularly for large block backlogs, which affects how long a channel remains open between safe head increases ([#18092](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18092)).

### Documentation for Cannon Kona Prestate
A new issue proposes documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades, emphasizing that while `opcm.upgrade` doesn't enforce it, standard chains should always set this prestate ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18095)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-deployer Transaction Gas Limit
Issue [#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17912) discusses `op-deployer:v0.2.6` failing to deploy contracts due to "transaction gas limit too high" errors. The latest comment confirms that the Fusaka hardfork on Sepolia enforces a transaction gas limit cap of 16,777,216 (EIP-7825), causing transactions exceeding this limit to be rejected. It's suggested that transactions might need to be broken down or optimized, and notes that this issue might persist even with newer `op-deployer` versions (v0.5.0*).

### L1 Chain Config for L3s
Issue [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18070) addresses the need for `op-node` and `op-program` to skip L1 chain config for L3s. The discussion suggests that the system should automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID and apply L3 behavior, similar to how L1 mainnet and Sepolia are recognized, to simplify the process for most L3s.

### Acceptance Test Monorepo Dependency
Issue [#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/469) focuses on making it easier to run acceptance tests without the monorepo. The latest comment highlights that modifying devnets with options often doesn't work due to orchestrator fields being private, indicating a challenge in externalizing test execution.
