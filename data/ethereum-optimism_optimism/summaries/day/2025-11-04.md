# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing rollup finality configuration, extending transaction structs for better tracking, and addressing several bug fixes across deployment and devstack tools. Significant progress was also made in migrating acceptance tests for dispute games.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Rollup Finality and Transaction Management Enhancements
New configuration fields were added to the rollup config to enable configurable finality behavior, improving flexibility for L3s. Additionally, the `ScheduledTransactions` struct in TimelockGuard was extended to include `txHash` and `nonce` for easier access and tracking of scheduled transactions.

- [#18097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18097)

### Deployment and Devstack Tooling Improvements
Bug fixes were implemented for the `op-deployer` to update `justfile` with current CLI flags and for `op-devstack` to provide debug information when L2CL peers connection fails. Several issues from the SaferSafes audit were also addressed without requiring bytecode changes.

- [#18149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18149)
- [#18147](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18147)

### Acceptance Test Suite Expansion
New acceptance tests were added for playing out dispute games, marking a migration of proof-related tests from `op-e2e` to `op-acceptance`. The CI configuration was updated to default to CircleCI runners for these tests, and the `op-acceptor` was updated to v3.6.2.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Finality Configuration for Rollups
The issue regarding the need for configurable finality parameters, particularly for L3s where hard-coded values were problematic, has been resolved.
- [#18009](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18009)

## NEW ISSUES

### Batcher Throttling Improvement
A new issue was opened to improve the `op-batcher`'s throttling controller by incorporating the blob base fee. This aims to prevent over-throttling due to data backlog when congestion is not blob-related.
- [#18150](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18150)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Proxyd Backwards Time Travel
Discussions on [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/501) continue regarding the "backwards time travel" issue in Proxyd when backends are out of sync. Joshklop noted that this problem might extend beyond `eth_call` to `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory`. Yashvardhan-kukreja brainstormed several approaches:
1.  **Multicall strategy for `eth_call`**: Fan out requests to all backends and return success if at least one responds. This increases `eth_call` traffic.
2.  **Block out of range error fallback**: Proxyd silently falls back to other backends upon receiving a "block out of range" error. This could lead to slower response times.
3.  **IP-based sticky sessions**: Maintain a time-bounded mapping between client IP and backend. This might skew requests for clients behind a single forward-proxy.
4.  **Sig-based sticky sessions**: Proxyd returns a tamper-proof, time-bound signature in the response, which the client can forward in subsequent requests to ensure consistency. This is considered most reliable but requires client-side changes.
Yashvardhan-kukreja prefers approach 1 if traffic allows, otherwise approach 2 for its ease of implementation.

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking
On [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18102), the discussion revolves around improving blob priority fee tracking for `op-batcher/txmgr`. Sebastianst commented on ajsutton's suggestion of decaying priority fees from the previous transaction. While acknowledging its potential to handle backlogs, Sebastianst noted that a dedicated blob priority fee tracker would provide better estimates from startup, avoiding the "cold start" issue after a batcher restart.

### Update `migrate` method
The discussion on [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17743) clarifies that this issue specifically tracks OPCM changes, with devstack changes being covered by [#17764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17764). This distinction was made to avoid confusion regarding the scope of the `migrate` method updates.
