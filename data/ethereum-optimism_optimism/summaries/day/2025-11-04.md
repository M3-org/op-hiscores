# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing rollup configuration, improving contract safety, and refining developer tooling. Key updates include configurable finality lookback, extended transaction details in TimelockGuard, and various fixes and updates across the op-deployer and op-devstack.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Rollup Configuration and Finality Enhancements
New configuration fields have been added to the rollup config, allowing for more flexible finality behavior. This includes the introduction of a default finality lookback, improving the adaptability of L2 finalization.
- [#18071](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18071)

### Contract Safety and Transaction Management
The `ScheduledTransactions` struct in TimelockGuard has been extended to include `txHash` and `nonce`, providing easier access to transaction details. Several fixes from the SaferSafes audit were also implemented, enhancing contract robustness without bytecode changes.
- [#18097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18097)
- [#18147](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18147)

### Developer Tooling and Infrastructure Improvements
Updates were made to the `op-deployer` to use current CLI flags and support the `op-contracts/v5.0.0-rc.2` upgrade. Debugging information was added to `op-devstack` for L2CL peer connection failures, and `op-geth` was updated to include fusaka and jovian timestamps.
- [#18143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18143)
- [#18149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18149)
- [#18154](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18154)
- [#18131](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18131)

### Core Protocol and Testing Refinements
The `predeploys` package was moved from `op-service` to `op-core` to better align with core protocol definitions. Acceptance tests were configured to run on CircleCI runners by default and updated to `op-acceptor v3.6.2`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Finality Configuration
The issue regarding the need for configurable finalization parameters, particularly for L3s, has been resolved with the implementation of new optional configuration fields in the rollup config.
- [#18009](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18009)

## NEW ISSUES

### Batcher Throttling Improvement
A new issue has been opened to improve the `op-batcher`'s throttling controller by incorporating blob base fee, addressing a recent incident where the batcher max throttled due to data backlog not caused by blob congestion.
- [#18150](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18150)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Proxyd Backwards Time Travel
Discussion continues on the `proxyd` issue where it can "travel back in time" by returning previous blocks if backends are out of sync. Potential solutions include a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, proxyd handling "block out of range" errors by falling back to other backends, IP-based sticky sessions, or signature-based sticky sessions. The most reliable approach (signature-based) would require client-side changes, while others offer drop-in fixes with trade-offs in performance or implementation complexity.
- [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/501)

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking in op-batcher/txmgr
The discussion revolves around improving blob priority fee tracking. A suggestion was made to have the starting priority fee for new transactions "decay" from the previous transaction to better handle backlogs during busy times, potentially as a simpler alternative to a comprehensive blob priority fee tracker. However, a dedicated tracker would provide better estimates from the start, especially after batcher restarts.
- [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18102)

### Update `migrate` method
The issue tracks changes to OPCM, with a recent comment clarifying that this issue specifically covers OPCM changes, while devstack changes are tracked separately.
