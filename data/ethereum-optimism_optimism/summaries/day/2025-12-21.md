# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 21, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on refining the `op-supernode`'s `superroot_atTimestamp` response format and implementing a supernode super root provider for `op-challenger`. A new issue was opened regarding `superroot_atTimestamp` consistency.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Supernode Super Root Provider Implementation
A new supernode super root provider has been implemented within `op-challenger`, with passing unit tests. This update also addresses a previous issue related to handling chain IDs in the dependency set at a requested timestamp. ([#18653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18653))

### Supernode `superroot_atTimestamp` Response Format Refinement
The `op-supernode`'s `superroot_atTimestamp` response format has been updated. This includes stopping the conversion of all errors into "not found" errors and switching to `ethereum.NotFound` as the designated "not found" error type for clearer flagging. ([#18652](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18652))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#18666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18666), was opened to address an issue in `op-node` where it should return an error instead of panicking when the L1 chain ID is nil.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES

### Supernode `superroot_atTimestamp` Consistency
A new issue, [#18667](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18667), was created to ensure the consistency of `superroot_atTimestamp` responses in `op-supernode`, addressing potential race conditions.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Node Synchronization Issues
Discussions on [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581) continue to revolve around node synchronization problems, specifically "missing trie node" errors. Users are reporting issues with `op-geth` and seeking guidance on obtaining the correct `geth` version and snapshots. The latest comments indicate a user asking for the `geth` version they should be using. Previous discussions highlighted that the error often suggests an incomplete or corrupted state database, with questions raised about full vs. archive nodes, unclean shutdowns, and execution clients.
