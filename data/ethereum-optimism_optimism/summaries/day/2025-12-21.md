# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the `superroot_atTimestamp` response format within `op-supernode` and implementing a supernode super root provider in `op-challenger`, enhancing data consistency and error handling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Supernode Super Root Provider Implementation
The `op-challenger` now includes an implementation for a supernode super root provider, which is not yet integrated but has passing unit tests. This update also correctly handles a related issue, adding chain IDs to the `superroot_atTimestamp` response. ([#18653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18653))

### Superroot Response Format and Error Handling Improvements
The `op-supernode` has updated its `superroot_atTimestamp` response format. This includes stopping the conversion of all errors into "not found" errors and switching to `ethereum.NotFound` as the designated "not found" error type for clearer flagging. ([#18652](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18652))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#18666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18666), was opened to address an issue in `op-node` where it should return an error instead of panicking when the L1 chain ID is nil.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Superroot Consistency Concerns
A new issue, [#18667](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18667), was opened to address potential inconsistencies in `superroot_atTimestamp` responses due to race conditions, requiring a review of the current implementation.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Node Synchronization and Trie Node Errors
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581) continues to be active, with users experiencing "missing trie node" errors and synchronization problems. The latest comments indicate a user, yaki-1337, is seeking information on where to obtain the `geth` version and is considering switching to Reth, after having deleted their previous setup. They also inquired about where to download OP-GETH. Another user, rdin777, previously suggested that "missing trie node" errors often indicate an incomplete or corrupted state database and asked for clarification on node type (full/archive), occurrence after unclean shutdowns, and the execution client being used (op-geth or reth). They also suggested trying `--syncmode=full` or checking disk IOPS.
