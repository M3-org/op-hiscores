# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing `op-deployer` with OPCM v2 support for chain upgrades and improving `op-sync-tester` with `engine_exchangeCapabilities`. Significant work was also done on a new `BlobGasPriceOracle` module and ignoring max-code-size limits during deployment.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Deployment and Upgrade Capabilities
The `op-deployer` tool received a significant upgrade with the addition of OPCM v2 support for chain upgrades, enabling more robust and flexible deployment processes ([#18593](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18593)). Additionally, `op-deployer` will now ignore max-code-size limits during deployment, streamlining the developer experience for devnet setups ([#18642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18642)).

### Blob Gas Price Oracle and Sync Tester Improvements
A new `BlobGasPriceOracle` module was introduced to `op-service`, designed to track and cache blob prices for more efficient transaction management ([#18386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18386)). The `op-sync-tester` was updated to support `engine_exchangeCapabilities`, which is crucial for Kona integration and testing ([#18628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18628)).

### Kona Integration and Testing Support
Support for Kona light CL was added to `op-devstack`, allowing for more flexible configuration of L2 consensus clients ([#18627](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18627)). A chore was also completed to skip unnecessary AI-generated tests for `CheckTrue.t.sol`, as it already has comprehensive coverage ([#18644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18644)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking
The issue regarding blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr` has been closed ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18102)). Discussions highlighted that the blob tip oracle is now deployed to production, and while currently informational, it suggests lower priority fees than the configured minimum, indicating potential for optimization.

### Sequencer Recover Mode Bug
A possible bug in `op-node`'s sequencer recover mode has been addressed and closed ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18350)). The issue involved the sequencer entering recover mode during normal operation and experiencing L1 origin drift. The resolution involved refactoring L1 origin code and a fix to prevent errors when the L1 origin is up to tip.

## NEW ISSUES

### Supernode Reporting Discrepancy
A new issue highlights that `op-supernode`'s `superroot_atTimestamp` API currently reports the minimum L1 block processed by derivation, not necessarily by verifiers, requiring an update to reflect verified L1 blocks ([#18651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18651)).

### Kona Migration and Cleanup
Several issues relate to the ongoing Kona migration:
- Removing outdated `just` recipes once Kona's monorepo migration is complete ([#18654](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18654)).
- Fixing a common/p2p peer check in Kona's tests ([#18655](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18655)).
- Merging `rollup-boost`'s and `kona`'s `OpEngineClient`s ([#18656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18656)).
- Reactivating e2e reorg tests for Kona in CI ([#18657](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18657)).
- Removing the `superchain-registry` submodule from Kona ([#18658](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18658)).

### Deployment Artifact Path Issue
A bug was reported in `op-deployer` where `ExtractFromFile()` expects an `out/` directory within the tarball, but the `mktar` tool packages artifacts with a `forge-artifacts/` prefix, breaking self-hosted `.tzst` artifacts ([#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18663)).
