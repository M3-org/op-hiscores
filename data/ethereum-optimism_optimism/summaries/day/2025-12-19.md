# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing `op-deployer` with OPCM v2 support for chain upgrades and improving `op-sync-tester` with `engine_exchangeCapabilities`. Significant work was also done on a new `BlobGasPriceOracle` module and addressing deployment limitations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Deployment and Upgrade Capabilities
The `op-deployer` tool received a major upgrade with support for OP Contracts Manager v2 (OPCM v2), enabling more robust chain upgrades. This includes version detection and handling of `UpgradeInputV2` ([#18593](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18593)). Additionally, `op-deployer` was updated to ignore max-code-size limits during deployment, improving the developer experience for devnet setups ([#18642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18642)).

### Blob Gas Price Oracle and Transaction Management
A new `BlobGasPriceOracle` module was introduced in `op-service`, designed to track and cache blob prices from new blocks and headers, similar to the existing `GasPriceOracle` ([#18386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18386)). This is a foundational step towards more efficient blob transaction management.

### Sync Tester and Devstack Improvements
The `op-sync-tester` now supports `engine_exchangeCapabilities`, a requirement for Kona integration ([#18628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18628)). Furthermore, `op-devstack` was updated to support Kona light CL by allowing the `KONA_NODE_L2_FOLLOW_SOURCE` environment variable ([#18627](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18627)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking
The issue concerning blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr` has been closed ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18102)). Discussions highlighted that the new blob tip oracle is now deployed to production, and while currently informational, it suggests lower priority fees than the configured minimum, indicating potential for optimization.

### Sequencer Recover Mode Bug
A possible bug in `op-node`'s sequencer recover mode was closed ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18350)). Although the drift issue could not be reproduced, related L1 origin code was refactored, and a fix was adopted to prevent errors when the L1 origin is up to tip.

## NEW ISSUES

### Supernode Reporting Discrepancy
A new issue highlights that `op-supernode`'s `superroot_atTimestamp` API reports the minimum L1 block processed by derivation, not necessarily by verifiers, requiring an update to reflect verified L1 blocks ([#18651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18651)).

### Kona Migration and Cleanup
Several issues relate to the ongoing Kona migration, including removing outdated `just` recipes once the migration is complete ([#18654](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18654)), fixing a common/p2p peer check in Kona tests ([#18655](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18655)), merging `rollup-boost`'s and `kona`'s `OpEngineClient`s ([#18656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18656)), reactivating e2e reorg tests for Kona in CI ([#18657](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18657)), and removing the superchain-registry submodule from Kona ([#18658](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18658)).

### op-deployer Artifact Path Issue
A bug was reported in `op-deployer` where `ExtractFromFile()` expects an `out/` directory within tarballs, but the `mktar` tool packages artifacts with a `forge-artifacts/` prefix, breaking self-hosted `.tzst` artifacts ([#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18663)).
