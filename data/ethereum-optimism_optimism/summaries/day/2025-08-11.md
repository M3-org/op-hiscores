- **Development Environment & Dependency Management:** [#17017](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17017) adds a `mise` lockfile, and [#17020](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17020) locks Cargo dependencies, indicating efforts to standardize and manage development environments.
- **Testing Infrastructure:** [#16996](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16996) introduces a change to cancel package-wide context in `Close` for development testing.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed on this day.

## NEW ISSUES

- **DA Footprint Limit Initiatives:** Several issues were opened to track progress on data availability footprint limits, including a general tracking issue [#16998](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16998), productionizing hackathon work [#16999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16999), and writing a design document [#17009](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17009).
- **`op-up` Tool Enhancements:** New issues were created to guide the development of the `op-up` tool, focusing on publishing an initial release [#17003](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/optimism/issues/17003), supporting the challenger [#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17005), and cleaning up logging [#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17007).
- **Dispute Game and Event System Refinements:** A new issue [#17013](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17013) was opened to track the development of "Multi-proofs" (Aggregate Dispute Game), aiming to combine multiple proof systems. Additionally, [#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17001) was created to remove two events from the event system.
- **Scalar Fix Postmortem:** An issue [#17012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17012) was opened to conduct a postmortem of an original Scalar issue.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **`op-test-sequencer` Integration:** Issue [#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15265) regarding the integration of `op-test-sequencer` into devnet environments and Kurtosis saw a new comment from emhane, stating that this integration is required to run reorg tests in the `kona-supervisor` devstack environment. This indicates continued relevance and a dependency for specific testing scenarios.
- **`min-base-fee` Specification:** On issue [#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/742), geoknee commented that the state growth estimate, initially considered for this specification, was better placed in the FMA and is now being tracked under [#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/316). This clarifies the scope of the `min-base-fee` specification and redirects the state growth analysis.
- **`min-base-fee` State Growth Estimate:** Issue [#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/316) was created to specifically track the state growth estimate for `min-base-fee`. geoknee provided a "napkin math" estimate, calculating approximately 16MB of state growth per year due to an extra byte for `minBaseFeeLog2` per block. This provides an initial quantitative assessment of the feature's impact on state size.
