# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `op-batcher` with advanced data availability throttling mechanisms, improving `kurtosis-devnet`'s support for non-template network descriptions, and migrating `cannon` fault tests. Significant cleanup and refactoring efforts were also undertaken across various components.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Data Availability Throttling for `op-batcher`
The `op-batcher` received a significant upgrade with the introduction of advanced throttling control mechanisms for Data Availability (DA). This enhancement expands beyond previous capabilities, offering multiple strategies for more robust and flexible DA management.
- Enhanced DA Throttling with multiple control mechanisms ([#16588](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16588))

### Infrastructure and Testing Improvements
Key improvements were made to development infrastructure and testing frameworks, including a fix for `kurtosis-devnet` to support non-template network descriptions and the migration of `cannon` fault tests to a new framework.
- Support for non-template network descriptions in `kurtosis-devnet` ([#16769](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16769))
- Migration of `cannon` fault tests to `DiffTester` framework ([#16767](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16767))

### Codebase Refinements and Cleanup
Several refactoring and cleanup tasks were completed, streamlining deployment checks for various contracts and removing outdated `TODO` comments from the codebase. Unnecessary assertions related to `l1standardbridge` were also removed.
- Cleanup of deploy checks for multiple contracts ([#16749](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16749))
- Removal of unnecessary `l1standardbridge` assertions ([#16715](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16715))
- Removal of outdated `TODO` comments ([#16775](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16775))
- `op-devstack` now tolerates absence of conductors ([#16776](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16776))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fault Proof Runbook Finalization
The final review of the Fault Proof Incident Runbook v3 was completed, and the "draft" label was removed. This involved updating references from other runbooks and renaming versions to clearly indicate which upgrade versions they cover. ([#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16651))

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-sync-tester` Enhancements
A new issue was opened to support the `sync` namespace in `op-sync-tester`. This includes adding `sync_getSession` for monitoring session status and `sync_delete` for managing sessions. ([#16778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16778))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Configurable DA Type for `op-e2e` Interop SuperSystem
Discussion continues on making the Data Availability (DA) type configurable for the `op-e2e` interop `SuperSystem` ([#15406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15406)). The issue was briefly closed incorrectly due to automation but has since been reopened. While the current `SuperSystem` uses calldata for batch posting, there's a desire for blob posting, especially for interop Fault Proof (FP) testing. There's an ongoing debate about whether this is a blocker for RC Beta, with some suggesting that existing blob preimage tests provide sufficient coverage and that the `SuperSystem` itself might be deprecated in favor of `op-devstack`. The consensus is that this needs to be addressed before removing pre-interop FP support, but it doesn't necessarily block immediate interop shipping.
