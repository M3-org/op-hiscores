# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, particularly enhancing `op-deployer` to support upgrades up to v4.1.0 and improving the stability of acceptance tests. New pull requests address various fixes, features, and dependency updates, while new and closed issues highlight ongoing efforts in `op-conductor` and `rollup-boost` health.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-deployer` Upgrade Support and Bug Fixes
The `op-deployer` tool received a significant update, enabling it to support and test upgrades up to v4.1.0. This involved updating the `superchain-registry/validation` package import to include standard `op-contracts/v4.1.0` addresses and porting existing upgrade support. This ensures the deployer can handle the latest contract versions. ([#17824](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17824))

### Acceptance Test Stability Improvements
Miscellaneous fixes were implemented for flake-shake, a tool used for acceptance tests. These improvements include rounding average durations to the nearest second and fixing the Slack notification CCI URL, contributing to more reliable and accurate test reporting. ([#17830](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17830))

### New Acceptance Test Integration
A new test, `TestL2ELP2PCanonicalChainAdvancedByFCU`, has been integrated into the FlakeShake system for `op-acceptance-tests`. This expands the test coverage and helps ensure the stability of the L2 EL P2P canonical chain. ([#17833](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17833))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Several new pull requests were opened today:
- [#17832](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17832) proposes passing the game type as a CWIA argument instead of a constructor argument for proofs.
- [#17834](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17834) aims to improve the test coverage and quality for ResourceMetering.
- [#17836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17836) addresses a potential hang by adding a default HTTP client timeout to `op-service/signer`.
- [#17837](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17837) introduces a `replica_id` label for multi-replica monitoring in `op-conductor`.
- [#17838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17838) focuses on adding context cancellation checks before network requests.
- [#17839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17839) seeks to improve the organization of `ReinitializableBase` tests.
- [#17840](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17840) aims to resolve artifact exclusion failures in scheduled runs for `ai-contracts-test`.
- [#17841](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17841) is a dependabot update to bump `github.com/lmittmann/w3` from 0.19.5 to 0.20.4.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `rollup-boost` Healthiness Tolerance
Two issues related to `rollup-boost` partial healthiness tolerance have been closed. These issues focused on implementing an opt-in tolerance for `op-rbuilder` failures in `op-conductor` to ignore harmless blips ([#17678](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17678)) and deploying this setting across devnet, sepolia, and mainnet ([#17680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17680)).

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-conductor` Flashblocks and Raft Timeout Issues
A new issue has been opened to investigate `op-conductor` flashblocks-streaming and raft timeout problems. The primary goal is to identify the root cause of `conductor` attempting to forward flashblocks from `rollup-boost`, specifically noting an error related to reading from the `rollup-boost` WebSocket due to a read limit. ([#17835](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17835))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Replica Healthcheck Monitoring
Issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17686) discusses the need for graceful monitoring and alerting of multiple replica-healthchecks per namespace. The latest comments indicate that a pull request was made with the intention to solve this issue. However, a maintainer clarified that the issue is out of the scope of `op-conductor` and its implementation is meant for the infrastructure end, belonging to the Platforms Team Tracker. The PR was subsequently closed, with an invitation for future contributions.
