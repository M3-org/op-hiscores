# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes for `op-acceptance-tests` and `op-deployer`, ensuring stability and supporting upgrades up to v4.1.0. New tests were added to enhance flake-shake coverage, and several new pull requests were opened addressing dependencies, context cancellation, and monitoring.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhancements to `op-deployer` for Upgrade Support
The `op-deployer` received significant updates to support upgrades up to v4.1.0, including updated `superchain-registry/validation` imports and porting upgrade support from a previous PR. This ensures the deployer can handle the latest contract versions. ([#17824](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17824))

### `op-acceptance-tests` Stability and Coverage Improvements
Miscellaneous fixes were implemented for `flake-shake` within `op-acceptance-tests` to improve stability, including rounding average durations and fixing a Slack notification URL. A new test, `TestL2ELP2PCanonicalChainAdvancedByFCU`, was also integrated into `FlakeShake` to expand test coverage. ([#17830](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17830), [#17833](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17833))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A dependency update for `github.com/lmittmann/w3` from 0.19.5 to 0.20.4 was proposed. ([#17841](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17841))
- A fix was introduced to add context cancellation checks before network requests to prevent issues. ([#17838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17838))
- A new feature for `op-conductor` was added to include a `replica_id` label for multi-replica monitoring. ([#17837](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17837))
- A fix for `op-service/signer` was proposed to add a default HTTP client timeout (30s) to prevent hangs. ([#17836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17836))
- A refactor was initiated to improve the test coverage and quality of `ResourceMetering`. ([#17834](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17834))
- A change was proposed for proofs to pass the game type as a CWIA argument instead of a constructor argument. ([#17832](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17832))
- Two additional pull requests, "Vaiosx fix specific issue 20251013" and "Vaiosx optimism contributions 20251013", were opened. ([#17845](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17845), [#17844](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17844))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Rollup-Boost Healthiness Tolerance
Two issues related to `rollup-boost` partial healthiness tolerance were closed. These issues aimed to introduce an opt-in tolerance for `op-rbuilder` failures within `op-conductor` to ignore harmless blips and to deploy this setting across devnet, sepolia, and mainnet. ([#17678](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17678), [#17680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17680))

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-conductor` Flashblocks and Raft Timeout Issues
A new issue was opened to identify the root cause behind `op-conductor` attempting to forward flashblocks from `rollup-boost`, specifically noting an error related to reading from the `rollup boost WebSocket` due to a read limit. ([#17835](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17835))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Graceful Monitoring and Alerting of Multiple Replica-Healthchecks
Issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17686) discusses the need for graceful monitoring and alerting when deploying an additional `replica-healthcheck` for nodes with `op-rbuilders`. The latest comment from yashvardhan-kukreja clarifies that a related PR by CreeptoGengar was closed because the issue is out of the scope of `op-conductor` and its implementation is meant for the infra end, currently marked as "blocked" and associated with the Platforms Team Tracker. The maintainer also advised discussing with a maintainer to get the issue assigned before making contributions.
