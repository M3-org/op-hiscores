# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on introducing Jovian feature toggles, critical bug fixes for custom gas tokens and deployer verification, and significant refactoring of devnet configurations. Testing efforts included increasing timeouts and de-flaking interop message tests.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Protocol Enhancements & Feature Toggles

## NEW ISSUES

### Fusaka Hardfork Preparations
- An issue was opened to prepare `op-node` for the Fusaka hardfork, focusing on derivation pipeline compatibility and converting excess blob gas into L1 cost. [#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17493)
- A related issue was created to develop a Fusaka activation test within `op-e2e/actions/proofs`, specifically for L1 activation. [#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17500)

### System Configuration and Metrics
- A new issue addresses the need for `op-node` to parse future `SystemConfig.ConfigUpdate` events without critical errors. [#17490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17490)
- Another issue proposes adding a DA footprint block metric, similar to the existing base fee block metric. [#17501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17501)

### Deployer Configuration
- An issue was opened to set the `FeesDepositor` address on the deployer upon deployment, requiring updates in `op-deployer` and `superchain-ops`. [#17505](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17505)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `TestPreNoInbox` Flakiness
- The issue [#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17298) concerning the flakiness of `TestPreNoInbox` in `op-acceptance-tests` remains active. A recent PR ([#17495](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17495)) aimed to fix this by adjusting the interop hardfork time, but a comment from `pcw109550` on 2025-09-17 indicates that the fix was unsuccessful. The issue continues to be a focus for stability improvements.

### `proxyd` and Fusaka Activation
- Issue [#467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/467) regarding `proxyd` preparation for Fusaka activation on L1 was opened and immediately closed on 2025-09-17, with a comment from `geoknee` stating it was resolved by #464. This indicates a swift resolution to the initial concerns about `proxyd`'s compatibility with the upcoming hardfork.
