# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `kona-proof`'s compatibility with L1 chain configurations, crucial for the upcoming Fusaka update. This ensures the proving system can correctly interpret L1 chain data.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Kona-Proof L1 Chain Configuration Compatibility
A significant feature was added to make `kona-proof` compatible with L1 chain configurations, which is essential for the Fusaka update. This involved modifications to the `op-challenger` and `op-e2e` components to explicitly provide L1 chain configuration to `kona-proof` and `op-program`. ([#17638](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17638))

### L2CL<>L2EL Syncing Conditions
Discussion continues on understanding the conditions for L2EL to initiate EL Syncing, particularly for `op-geth` with `op-sepolia` ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17628)). The latest comments clarify that the EL client should simply sync after receiving a FCU call, regardless of whether it's a snap-sync or full block execution. There's a consensus that the EL client's internal syncing mechanism should not leak implementation details to the L2CL. The issue may be closed as the approach to handle EL Syncs after initial runs is being addressed in `engineController.insertUnsafePayload`.
