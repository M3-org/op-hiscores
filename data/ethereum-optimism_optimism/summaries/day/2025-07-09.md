# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on bug fixes, particularly in test validation and deployer functionality, alongside significant updates to `op-chain-ops` for withdrawal proving and `op-node` for safe head database management during EL sync.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Test Infrastructure Improvements
Bug fixes were implemented to ensure compliance of `/universal` tests with validation scripts and to address a broken test in `op-deployer` related to U16 updates.
- Bug Fixes: [#16610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16610), [#16657](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16657)

### Withdrawal Proving and Dispute Monitoring Enhancements
The `op-chain-ops` script was updated to support proving withdrawals using super roots, and `op-dispute-mon` was improved to consider block numbers above `MaxInt64` as always invalid, preventing unnecessary output root requests.
- Other Work: [#16641](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16641), [#16643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16643)

### Node Synchronization and Database Management
A critical update to `op-node` ensures the safe head database is deleted when an EL sync is triggered, improving synchronization reliability.
- Other Work: [#16644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16644)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#16646](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16646): A test PR to trigger the pipeline.
- [#16649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16649): Related to `Sc test/invar permissionless proposals`.
- [#16654](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16654): A fix to propagate goroutine errors to the main thread for accurate error handling in `listGames`.
- [#16661](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16661): A fix for a missing part.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Test Reliability and Flakiness
Efforts to improve the reliability of acceptance tests were concluded, with significant improvements noted in test consistency and flakiness monitoring.
- Closed: [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16378)

### Interop Mode and Supervisor Logic
Several issues related to the `op-node`'s trivial-interop mode, including operating without a supervisor and providing Interop proofs RPCs, were closed as they are no longer being prioritized.
- Closed: [#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16519), [#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16520), [#16521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16521)

### Batcher Throttling Issue
An issue concerning `op-batcher`'s `SetMaxDASize` RPC availability or breakage was closed due to inactivity.
- Closed: [#15355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15355)

## NEW ISSUES

### Deployment and Verification Process
A new issue proposes making `VerifyOPCM` a wrapper around `DeployImplementations` for v2, aiming to streamline the deployment and verification process.
- New: [#16653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16653)

### Fault Proof Runbook Review
A final review of the v3 fault proof incident runbook is required before removing its "draft" label.
- New: [#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16651)

### Interop Transaction Reinjection Test
A new test is needed to confirm that interop transactions are re-checked when a block is reorged and transactions are reinjected into the mempool.
- New: [#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16656)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes
Discussion continues on the OPCM changes for the Fault Proof creator contract [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15789). The latest update outlines a comprehensive checklist of tasks, including moving `WETH` and `L2ChainId` to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, addressing `TODO` comments, and rebasing updates from EVM safety refactoring.

### RV Audit Findings
An ongoing discussion on RV Audit findings [#16548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16548) highlights issues with `TestCrossSafeUpdate` testing impossible cases and the lack of a clear `invalid` signal during Hazard Set construction. A pull request has been made to address these points.

### Abnormal CPU Usage with op-geth
The issue of abnormal CPU usage with `op-geth` v1.101511.0 [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/613) remains active. Recent comments suggest the high CPU usage might be temporary due to index updates, with one user confirming a return to normal after 24 hours. Another user provided a `pprof` file for analysis, indicating the issue might be related to index updates. There's also a discussion on how to properly enable and capture `pprof` metrics for debugging.
