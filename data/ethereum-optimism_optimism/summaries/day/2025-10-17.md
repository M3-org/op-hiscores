# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on bug fixes in logging and service configuration, alongside significant additions to acceptance tests for sync behavior and the integration of `CANNON_KONA` game support. Updates to `op-geth` for DA footprint calculation were also completed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Service Stability and Logging Improvements
Critical bug fixes were implemented to enhance the stability and consistency of core services. This includes adding a missing log level configuration to the `kona-supervisor` to ensure consistent logging behavior with `kona-node` ([#17496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17496)). Additionally, the `op-conductor` now utilizes the `op-service` HTTP Server for Flashblocks, resolving an issue with port auto-assignment and improving test reliability ([#17880](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17880)).

### Enhanced Acceptance Testing for Sync and Network Behavior
New acceptance tests were introduced to rigorously validate network synchronization under various conditions. A key addition is `TestReachUnsafeTipByAppendingUnsafePayload`, which simulates scenarios where the ELP2P is down but payloads can still be appended to reach the chain tip ([#17895](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17895)). Another test focuses on disabling discovery to prevent unwanted peer connections during specific test scenarios ([#17918](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17918)).

### DA Footprint and Fault Dispute Game Updates
Significant updates were made to integrate new features and improve data handling. The `op-geth` component was updated to utilize the `blobGasUsed` field for DA footprint calculation, moving away from shared data ([#17861](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17861)). Furthermore, `op-fetcher` now supports the `CANNON_KONA` FaultDisputeGame, enabling its use as a "DevFeature" for new and upgraded chains ([#17656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17656)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fault Dispute Game and Chain Info Updates
Issues related to the `CANNON_KONA` fault dispute game and chain information fetching have been resolved. This includes updating `FetchChainInfo.s.sol` ([#17740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17740)) and ensuring proof tests run against Kona ([#17483](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17483)).

### Conductor Flashblocks Port Auto-Assignment
The issue concerning the `op-conductor`'s ability to auto-assign ports for Flashblocks has been addressed, improving the flexibility and reliability of the service ([#17879](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17879)).

### L2CL EL Sync Documentation
Documentation for the EL Sync behavior of `op-node` and `kona-node` has been compiled, providing clearer insights into their design and desired outcomes ([#17693](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17693)).

## NEW ISSUES

### op-deployer Transaction Gas Limit Error
A new issue has been reported where `op-deployer:v0.2.6` fails to deploy contracts due to a "transaction gas limit too high" error, preventing successful contract deployment ([#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17912)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher: Prepare for Fusaka ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17472))
The discussion revolves around the `op-batcher`'s behavior when Fusaka activates on L1. The latest comment indicates a plan to reopen the issue to cover releasing a new batcher version that automatically switches to cell proofs and incorporates the mainnet Fusaka time via `op-service` / `op-geth`. Previous discussions included manual testing against a Fusaka L1.

### op-batcher: Ensure full shutdown when "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" ([#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17768))
The issue addresses instances where the `op-batcher` encounters "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" errors without fully shutting down. The latest update suggests maintaining the current detection logic but ensuring the process exits entirely, rather than just stopping part of the batcher. This would allow the batcher to enter a crashloop and automatically recover when the `SetMaxDASize` RPC method becomes available again.
