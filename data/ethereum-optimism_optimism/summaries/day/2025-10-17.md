# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on bug fixes in logging and service configuration, alongside significant additions to acceptance tests for sync behavior and the integration of `CANNON_KONA` game support. Updates to `op-geth` for DA footprint calculation were also completed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Service Enhancements & Bug Fixes
Critical bug fixes were implemented to improve logging consistency and service stability. The `kona-supervisor` now includes the `KONA_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable for consistent logging behavior [#17496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17496). Additionally, the `op-conductor` was updated to use `op-service` HTTP Server for Flashblocks, resolving a test flake and improving port handling [#17880](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17880).

### Acceptance Test Suite Expansion
New acceptance tests were added to enhance coverage of synchronization scenarios. A test was introduced to demonstrate reaching an unsafe tip by appending an unsafe payload even when ELP2P is down [#17895](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17895). Another test was updated to disable discovery, preventing unwanted peer connections during specific test conditions [#17918](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17918).

### Infrastructure and Protocol Updates
Significant updates were made to integrate new protocol features and improve data handling. `op-geth` was updated to utilize the `blobGasUsed` field for DA footprint calculation, moving away from shared data [#17861](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17861). The `op-fetcher` now supports the `CANNON_KONA` FaultDisputeGame, enabling its use as a "DevFeature" for new or upgraded chains [#17656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17656).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Test Infrastructure and Documentation Improvements
Several issues related to testing and documentation were closed today. This includes running actions/proof tests against Kona [#17483](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17483) and documenting EL Sync behavior for `op-node` and `kona-node` [#17693](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17693).

### FetchChainInfo and Conductor Enhancements
Updates to `FetchChainInfo.s.sol` were completed [#17740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17740). Additionally, an issue allowing flashblocks port auto-assignment in the Conductor was resolved [#17879](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17879).

## NEW ISSUES

### Deployment Transaction Gas Limit
A new issue reports that `op-deployer:v0.2.6` fails to deploy contracts due to a "transaction gas limit too high" error [#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17912).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher: Prepare for Fusaka [#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17472)
The discussion on this issue indicates that the `op-batcher` needs to be updated to handle Fusaka's activation on L1 by sending blob transactions with cell proofs instead of blob proofs. The issue was reopened to cover releasing a new batcher version that includes auto-switching to cell proofs and has the mainnet Fusaka time baked in via `op-service` / `op-geth`. Manual testing against a Fusaka L1 is also outlined.

### op-batcher: ensure full shutdown when "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" [#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17768)
The latest update suggests maintaining the current detection logic for the "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" error. Instead of introducing a metric or log, the batcher should perform a full process exit, not just a partial stop. This will allow the batcher to enter a crashloop and automatically recover when the `SetMaxDASize` RPC method becomes available again.
