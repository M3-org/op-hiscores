# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on introducing a new revenue-sharing feature with a `FeeSplitter` predeploy, addressing security audit fixes for SaferSafes, and enhancing CI/CD stability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Revenue Sharing and Contract Enhancements
A new `FeeSplitter` predeploy has been introduced to simplify and modularize revenue sharing, allowing for configurable values and automated handling. This feature aims to streamline the distribution of revenue within the Optimism ecosystem. ([#17536](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17536))

### Security and Stability Improvements
Critical audit fixes for SaferSafes have been implemented, specifically addressing a vulnerability where `configureTimelock` allowed a zero delay. This enhances the security posture of the system. ([#18172](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18172)) Additionally, CI processes were updated to use cached Solidity compilers, reducing the likelihood of "text file busy" errors and improving build reliability. ([#18140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18140))

### Challenger and Node Updates
Support for "super-kona games" has been added to `op-challenger`, expanding its capabilities. ([#18184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18184)) The `op-node` saw some dead code removal, contributing to a cleaner and more efficient codebase. ([#18183](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18183)) Furthermore, `kona-host` logging was adjusted to prevent color codes from being outputted, resolving an issue where `cannon` interpreted them as binary data. ([#18182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18182))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Audit and Compatibility Review
The issue concerning the audit of OPCM changes for Kona and Cannon has been closed, as it is now covered by a broader issue. ([#17371](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17371))

## NEW ISSUES

### Kona Compatibility
A new issue has been opened to address Kona's incompatibility with websocket URLs for L2 EL connections in acceptance tests. This requires either Kona to support websockets or `sysgo` to provide a non-websocket URL. ([#18203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18203))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility
Discussion continues on the `cannon: Support go1.25` issue ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17060)). The latest comment confirms that the MIPS fix for Go 1.25.4 addresses the issue where Keccak hashes were incorrect in Cannon when running with Go 1.25. This was a critical problem affecting block hash calculations.

### op-batcher max frame size
The issue `op-batcher [altda]: should not limit max frame size to max input size in generic mode` ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17796)) has seen recent activity. A comment from `tessr` suggests that the issue has been addressed in PR [#18074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074) and asks if the issue can be closed.

### op-sync-tester Jovian Support
Regarding `op-sync-tester: Support Jovian` ([#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18126)), a PR has been created by `CreeptoGengar` which is expected to resolve this issue.

### op-batcher Rollup Config Sync
The discussion on `op-batcher: stay in sync with op-node rollup config` ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18178)) highlights the brittleness of the current approach where the batcher only fetches the rollup config once at startup. `sebastianst` suggests that making the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher could be a pragmatic solution, potentially loading it from the embedded superchain-registry for known chains. `joshklop` agrees with this approach, noting it avoids unnecessary concurrency. The main downside identified is that a new batcher release would be needed for each Superchain Registry config change.
