# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on introducing a new fee splitter for revenue sharing, addressing security audit fixes, and enhancing monitoring capabilities. Significant work was also done on Superchain interoperability and developer tooling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Revenue Sharing and Contract Enhancements
A new `FeeSplitter` predeploy was introduced to simplify and modularize revenue sharing with configurable values and automated handling. This feature aims to streamline the distribution of protocol revenue. Security fixes from the SaferSafes audit were also implemented, addressing potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

- [#18172](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18172)

### Monitoring and Supernode Improvements
New metrics were added to `op-dispute-mon` to track out-of-sync node endpoints, enhancing the monitoring of network health. The `op-supernode` also saw improvements with the introduction of Runnable and RPC Activities, including a Heartbeat activity for health confirmation.

- [#18141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18141)

### Challenger and Node Optimizations
Support for "super-kona" games was added to `op-challenger`, expanding its capabilities. Additionally, dead code was removed from `op-node` for better maintainability, and a fix was implemented to prevent `kona-host` from using color in logs, which caused issues with `cannon`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kona + Cannon Audit
The audit for Kona + Cannon OPCM changes has been closed, with the work now covered by another issue.
- [#17371](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17371)

## NEW ISSUES

### Kona Compatibility and Dispute Monitoring
New issues have been opened regarding Kona's compatibility with websocket URLs in acceptance tests, requiring changes to either Kona or `sysgo`. Additionally, further work is needed to complete multi-supervisor support in `op-dispute-mon` and to create a dashboard for displaying new multi-node metrics.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go1.25 Compatibility
Discussion continues on the compatibility of Cannon with Go 1.25. It has been confirmed that the issue affects Optimism, specifically causing incorrect Keccak hashes when running in Cannon with Go 1.25. A fix was released in Go 1.25.4, which is expected to resolve the problem.
- [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17060)

### op-batcher altDA Frame Size Limit
The issue regarding `op-batcher` not limiting max frame size to max input size in generic mode for altDA has been addressed by PR [#18074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074). There is a suggestion to update the Optimism specs to reflect this change.
- [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17796)

### op-sync-tester Jovian Support
A pull request has been created to add support for Jovian to `op-sync-tester`, aiming to resolve the issue of supporting the Jovian Hard Fork.
- [#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18126)

### op-batcher Rollup Config Sync
The discussion revolves around how `op-batcher` should stay in sync with `op-node`'s rollup configuration. One suggestion is to have the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher, which would simplify the process and ensure consistency, especially for Superchain Registry chains. This approach would require a new batcher release for each Superchain Registry config change.
