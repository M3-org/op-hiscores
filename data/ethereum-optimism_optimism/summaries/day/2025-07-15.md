# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure by porting several acceptance tests to devstack and introducing a new differential testing framework for Cannon. Significant bug fixes were implemented across `op-service`, `op-batcher`, `kurtosis-devnet`, and `contracts-bedrock`, improving stability and reliability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure and Stability
Several critical acceptance tests, including ERC20 bridge, withdrawals root, and chain tests, were successfully ported to `op-devstack` for persistent devnets ([#16695](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16695), [#16547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16547), [#16594](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16594)). A new "DiffTester" framework was introduced for Cannon, enabling robust differential testing for VM steps and migrating existing noop/unsupported syscall tests ([#16608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16608), [#16707](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16707)).

### Core Component Bug Fixes and Improvements
Key bug fixes include adding JSON keys to the `OutputV0` type in `op-service` ([#16538](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16538)), removing a duplicate check in `op-batcher` ([#16696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16696)), and fixing a race condition in `op-dispute-mon`'s test suite ([#16697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16697)). The `kurtosis-devnet` now includes retry mechanisms for build and deploy steps to improve resilience ([#16663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16663)).

### Contract and Build System Refinements
An edge case in the unused imports check script for `contracts-bedrock` was fixed, preventing incorrect flagging of used imports within string quotes or after comments ([#16693](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16693)). CircleCI images were updated to support Dependabot PRs ([#16676](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16676)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#16698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16698), was opened to fix the `cfg.InitialBond` assignment in the `add-game-type` sub-command within `op-deployer`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Testing and Development Workflow Improvements
Two issues related to the Bailiff bot, concerning emoji reactions when working and providing feedback to first-time users, were closed ([#12684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12684), [#12685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12685)). The `op-batcher` duplicate code issue was resolved ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16677)). The `TestChainFork` port to devstack was completed ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/413)).

### Infrastructure and Deployment Decisions
Discussions around the need for NVMe node deployment for `op-rbuilders` were concluded, with a decision to skip it for now due to performance observations and a focus on more immediate issues ([#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16689)). Similarly, the need for dedicated namespacing of `rbuiders` was deprioritized in favor of adding additional labels to alerts and components within the existing sequencer namespace ([#16690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16690)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Sync Tester Development
Several new issues were opened to outline the development of an `op-sync-tester`. This includes session handling and middleware ([#16699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16699)), support for the `eth` namespace ([#16700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16700)) and `engine` namespace ([#16701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16701)), and integration with `sysext` ([#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16704)) and `sysgo` ([#16702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16702)). The goal is to support sync acceptance tests ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16703)) and enable the `op-sync-tester` as a standalone service ([#16705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16705)).

### Validator Enhancements and Migration
New issues were created to enhance the `op-validator`, including adding Kurtosis support ([#16712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16712)), automatic startup with `op-acceptor` ([#16711](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16711)), and improved checks for network configurations and contract addresses ([#16713](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16713)). A migration to Blockscout as the block explorer was also proposed ([#16714](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16714)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblocks on Sunnyside Sequencers
The issue [#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16688) discusses enabling flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers. The latest comment indicates that all sequencers (voting and non-voting) for Sepolia on Sunnyside are running with Flashblocks and connected to the websocket proxy. Failover has been tested on the `eris-0` devnet. This issue was deprioritized earlier in favor of stabilizing flashblocks on OP Labs Sepolia infrastructure.

### Txpool Invalid Interop Tx Inclusion
Issue [#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/635) concerns the conditional inclusion of invalid interop transactions in the txpool. Recent comments highlight ongoing investigation into the flakiness observed in CI, where invalid transactions were occasionally included despite ingress filtering. Reproduction efforts have been challenging, with attempts to run tests on repeat not consistently reproducing the issue. The discussion points to a potential deeper problem within `geth`'s transaction handling or filtering logic, as the current analysis suggests no clear path for invalid transactions to bypass filters and enter the mempool. Artifacts from a flaky CI run were provided for further analysis.
