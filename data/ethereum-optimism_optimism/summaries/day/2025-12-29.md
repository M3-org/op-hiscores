## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No completed work to report for this period.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Several new pull requests were opened today, focusing on `op-batcher` stability, `conductor` features, and contract testing:
- **`op-batcher` Stability Improvements:** Two pull requests aim to enhance the robustness of the `op-batcher`. [#18702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18702) addresses a potential race condition in `receiptsLoop`, while [#18701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18701) tackles a nil pointer dereference in `getReadyChannel`.
- **`conductor` Feature Enhancements:** Three new pull requests introduce new functionalities to the `conductor`. [#18700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18700) adds a `demote-voter` RPC command, [#18699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18699) introduces a raft configuration option to allow no shutdown on removal, and [#18697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18697) aims to fix a leader loop switch issue by implementing round-robin leadership transfer.
- **Contract Test Coverage:** [#18696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18696) focuses on improving test coverage for `OptimismMintableERC20` contracts.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No closed issues to report for this period.

## NEW ISSUES
- **`op-batcher` Data Availability Concerns:** A new question has been raised regarding potential problems when running `op-batcher` with `--data-availability-type=callData` for new chains. The user is seeking clarification on whether this configuration, which bypasses blob storage and L1 beacon configuration, introduces any issues. [#18698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18698)
