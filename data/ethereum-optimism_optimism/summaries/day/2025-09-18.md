# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 18, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on enhancing the `op-sync-tester` with EL Sync support, refining contract parameters for dispute games, and streamlining the CI/CD pipeline. Several new pull requests were opened, addressing L1 chain configuration and e2e testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Sync Tester Enhancements
The `op-sync-tester` now supports EL Sync, improving the testing capabilities for L2 client synchronization. This includes new test files and updates to `op-devstack` and `op-service` components to integrate EL Sync functionality. Additionally, an unused `elSyncEnabled` flag was removed from `op-node` to streamline the codebase.

- [#17425](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17425)

### Contract Parameter Refinements
Parameters for `proposer` and `challenger` in the `PermissionedDisputeGameV2` contract have been moved from the constructor to immutable storage. This change affects several contract files and their associated tests, enhancing contract immutability and security.
- [#17463](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17463)

### CI/CD Pipeline Optimization
A "hold job phase" was removed from the CircleCI configuration, indicating an effort to simplify and potentially speed up the continuous integration process.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#17520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17520) WIP: pass L1 chain config to `CalcBlobFeeDefault`: This pull request is a work in progress aimed at passing L1 chain configuration to the `CalcBlobFeeDefault` function.
- [#17522](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17522) op-e2e/actions: add L1 Osaka activation test: This PR introduces a new end-to-end test to verify the activation of L1 Osaka.

## CLOSED ISSUES
- No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES

### Fusaka Compatibility
An issue was opened to update `optimism-package` to support Fusaka on L1, which requires bumping the `ethereum-package` version in both `optimism-package` and `optimism`.
- [#17521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17521)

### Test Parallelization
A new issue proposes parallelizing the "memory-all" job in `op-acceptance-tests` to prevent increased CI duration as this workflow becomes blocking.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fusaka Preparation
The issue [#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17493) discusses preparing `op-node` for Fusaka, focusing on derivation pipeline compatibility and converting excess blob gas into L1 cost. A recent comment from @geoknee highlights a concern that tight coupling to upstream Geth code might necessitate absolute prestate updates with every upstream merge and `op-geth`/`op-node` release.

### Logging and Reporting
Issue [#461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/461) addresses logging all configuration at start-up and in the HTML report for `op-acceptor`. @scharissis confirmed this has been completed in a related pull request.

### Test Parallelism Improvement
The issue [#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/462) focuses on improving parallelism in `op-acceptor` tests, specifically to allow `t.Parallel()` and `devtest.ParallelT()` to function correctly within packages. @scharissis noted that this has also been completed as part of a related pull request.
