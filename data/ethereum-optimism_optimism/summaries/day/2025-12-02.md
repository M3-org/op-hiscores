# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the Optimism ecosystem with a new system feature for Custom Gas Tokens, significant improvements to the `op-challenger` for ZK game types, and unifying the websocket client for better stability across `op-devstack` and `op-conductor`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Custom Gas Token System Feature Integration
- The `CUSTOM_GAS_TOKEN` development feature flag has been removed and replaced with a system feature flag, streamlining its usage across CI, deployer, and tests. ([#18405](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18405))

### `op-challenger` Enhancements for ZK Games
- `op-challenger` now supports challenging invalid ZK game types, marking initial progress towards robust ZK game dispute resolution. ([#18442](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18442))
- The `TraceType` concept has been removed in favor of `GameType`, simplifying the game type definitions and improving clarity. ([#18433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18433))
- A generic `Player` implementation has been introduced to handle sync status and prestate validation, reducing boilerplate for new game types. ([#18441](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18441))
- Client providers are now a service-level concept, allowing them to be shared between fault and ZK game types. ([#18440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18440))

### Infrastructure and Testing Improvements
- The factory workflow in CI has been updated to use the `attest` parameter, fixing attestation failures on fork PRs. ([#18471](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18471))
- A single, unified transport websocket client has been introduced and integrated into `op-devstack` and `op-conductor`, replacing bespoke wrappers and improving stability. ([#18324](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18324))
- The `op-dispute-mon` has been updated to include `cannon-kona` and `optimistic-zk` in its list of output root game types, reflecting current game type usage. ([#18469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18469))

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-node` Synchronization and P2P Issues
- An issue was reported where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart, even when Reth has synced data, continuously reporting `el_syncing=true`. ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18468))
- Sequencer blocks are being rejected by P2P due to "timestamp too old" errors when the chain is behind wall clock time, leading to potential decentralization issues. ([#18470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18470))

### `op-challenger` ZK Game Challenges
- A new issue proposes challenging optimistic ZK games where the proposal is for currently unsafe blocks, even if the output root matches, to prevent finalization of unsafe games. ([#18466](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18466))

### Reth Snapshots for Verifiers
- A feature request was opened to add `op-reth` snapshots to `https://datadirs.optimism.io` to support verifiers and node operators using Reth. ([#18473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18473))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node` Invalid Block Signature ([#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17448))
A user reported encountering "invalid block signature unrecognized signer" errors during testnet deployment. Another user, `lyh169`, commented today asking for a solution to the same problem, indicating this issue persists for some users.

### Proxyd Backwards Time Travel ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/501))
The discussion on this issue, concerning `proxyd` returning previous blocks as `unsafe` when backends are out of sync, saw an update from `yashvardhan-kukreja` today. They plan to focus on this issue from January 1st, 2026, during their next on-call. `joshklop` acknowledged the update with no additional concerns. Previous discussions included brainstorming various approaches like multicall strategies, silent fallbacks, and IP/signature-based sticky sessions, with `yashvardhan-kukreja` favoring approach 1 (multicall) if traffic allows, or approach 2 (silent fallback) for ease of implementation.
