# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the Optimism ecosystem with a new Custom Gas Token system feature, significant improvements to the op-challenger for ZK game types, and updates to CI workflows.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Custom Gas Token System Feature
- Introduced a new system feature for Custom Gas Tokens (CGT), removing the previous `CUSTOM_GAS_TOKEN` dev feature flag and updating CI, deployer, and tests accordingly ([#18405](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18405)).

### op-challenger Enhancements for ZK Games
- Refactored `op-challenger` to remove `TraceType` in favor of `GameType`, with a backward-compatible alias for `--trace-type` to `--game-types` ([#18433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18433)).
- Made the client provider a service-level concept to allow sharing between fault and ZK game types ([#18440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18440)).
- Added initial support for challenging invalid Optimistic ZK game types, though it currently does not resolve them or claim bonds back ([#18442](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18442)).
- Introduced a generic `Player` implementation to handle sync status and prestate validation, reducing boilerplate for ZK games ([#18441](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18441)).
- Updated `op-dispute-mon` to include `cannon-kona` and `optimistic-zk` in the list of game types using output roots ([#18469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18469)).

### Infrastructure and CI Updates
- Unified on a single transport websocket client and integrated it into devstack and conductor, replacing bespoke wrappers ([#18324](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18324)).
- Updated the factory workflow in CI to use the `attest` parameter, fixing attestation failures on fork PRs ([#18471](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18471)).
- Removed asterisc bundling from the `op-challenger` Docker image and `asterisc-kona` from default game types ([#18476](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18476)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#18474](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18474) proposal/op contracts/v5.0.0 rc.1+l2 fee splitter contracts
- [#18472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18472) test: use ARM64-enabled asterisc test image from ttl.sh
- [#18463](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18463) wip: opcmv2 support for interop migration

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### op-challenger Challenges
- An issue was opened to challenge optimistic ZK games where the proposal is currently unsafe, even if the output root matches, to avoid finalization risks ([#18466](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18466)).

### op-node Synchronization Problems
- `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after restart when Reth already has synced data, continuously reporting `el_syncing=true` ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18468)).
- Sequencer blocks are rejected by P2P with "timestamp too old" errors when the chain is behind wall clock time, leading to a degraded network state ([#18470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18470)).

### Reth Snapshots Request
- A feature request was made to add `op-reth` snapshots to `https://datadirs.optimism.io` for verifiers and node operators using Reth ([#18473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18473)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `proxyd` Backwards Time Travel
- Discussion on [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/501) continues regarding `proxyd` returning previous blocks as `unsafe` if backends are out of sync. Yashvardhan-kukreja plans to focus on this issue from January 1st, 2026, during their next on-call, with joshklop expressing no additional concerns at the moment. Previous brainstorming included "multicall" for `eth_call`, `proxyd` awareness of "block out of range" errors, IP-based sticky sessions, and signature-based sticky sessions, with the latter requiring client-side changes.

### `op-node` Invalid Block Signature
- A user reported encountering "op-node invalid block signature unrecognized signer" errors during testnet deployment on [#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17448). Another user, lyh169, confirmed experiencing the same problem and is seeking a solution, indicating this is a recurring issue.
