# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jun 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing transaction management with a new feature to rebroadcast transactions without fee bumps. Discussions continued on improving release pipelines, addressing `op-node` goroutine issues, and refining supervisor event handling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Transaction Management Enhancements**: A new feature was added to the transaction manager and batcher, allowing for the rebroadcasting of signed transactions without increasing gas fees. This improves the flexibility and efficiency of transaction handling. ([#16310](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16310))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   **Supervisor Event Handling**: A pull request was opened to add a `byType sync.Map` to `op-node/rollup/event`, likely to improve event processing and debugging within the supervisor. ([#16471](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16471))
*   **Documentation Cleanup**: A pull request was submitted to remove a broken image link from the README, improving the repository's documentation quality. ([#16475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16475))
*   **CI/CD Improvements**: A pull request was opened to cache Rust installations in the CI pipeline using `mise`, aiming to speed up build times. ([#16480](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16480))

## CLOSED ISSUES
*   **Flashblocks Enablement**: The issue concerning the enablement of flashblocks on `eris-0` for testing in a non-interop environment was closed, with a detailed breakdown of the completed phases and associated PRs across `optimism-charts`, `devnets`, and `k8s` repositories. ([#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16468))

## NEW ISSUES
*   **Super DA Error Codes**: A new issue was opened to add missing error codes for data availability errors caused by reorgs, specifically those currently absent from the Go implementation in the specification. ([#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/725))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
*   **Interop EL Prestate Check**: Discussion continued on the issue of checking the EL prestate for pre-interop `CrossL2Inbox` configuration faults. The latest comment suggests that the execution client is not well-suited for this validation, and the risk has been mitigated through improvements in the genesis generation tooling (`op-deployer`), which now correctly determines the inclusion of `CrossL2Inbox` based on the number of chains. ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15765))
*   **GoReleaser for OP Stack Components**: The discussion around using GoReleaser for `op-node/batcher/proposer/challenger` release pipelines saw a new comment suggesting a lighter-weight solution for changelog generation using `git cliff`. The goal is to automate release notes and streamline the release process. ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16097))
*   **op-node Stuck Goroutines**: Users continue to report issues with `op-node` (v1.13.3) getting stuck with thousands of goroutines, primarily in `select`, `IO wait`, or `yamux` session handlers, leading to sync problems. This indicates an ongoing stability concern for the `op-node`. ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16332))
*   **op-supervisor Event Overflow**: The issue of the `op-supervisor` crashing due to event overflow when the unsafe head gap is too large is being actively investigated. There's a debate on whether `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` or `"cross-unsafe-update"` events are the primary culprits. A PR has been proposed to add a counter per event type to aid in debugging future occurrences. ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16335))
*   **Persistent Devnets Acceptance Tests**: Progress was noted on getting all acceptance tests running and passing in persistent devnets, with a recent addition of L1 Faucet support. This indicates ongoing efforts to improve the testing infrastructure. ([#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/398))
*   **Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet**: The discussion clarified the difference between `supersim` and `interop kurtosis devnet`. `supersim` is described as a lighter-weight wrapper around Anvil for local development and testing of multichain/interop applications, while Kurtosis is used for the underlying OP Stack chain testing.
