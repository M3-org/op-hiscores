# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on refining the op-devstack for L2 fork requirements, enhancing testing infrastructure with Kona prestate support, and streamlining deployment scripts by removing outdated PreimageOracle components.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Devstack Refinements and L2 Fork Management
The `op-devstack` saw a significant refactoring in how L2 forks are handled, improving the clarity and efficiency of fork requirements across various tests. This change impacts several acceptance tests related to fees, bridges, and features. ([#18228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18228))

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure for Proofs
Support for building and utilizing a Kona prestate in dev stack tests was added, significantly bolstering the testing capabilities for proofs. This includes updates to CircleCI configuration for caching and new scripts for running the Kona host. Additionally, a test was added to ensure contract deployers have sufficient ETH. ([#18144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18144), [#18230](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18230))

### Deployment Script Cleanup
Outdated `DeployPreimageOracle` scripts were removed from the `op-deployer` and `contracts-bedrock` packages. This cleanup streamlines the deployment process and removes unnecessary components. ([#18151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18151))
