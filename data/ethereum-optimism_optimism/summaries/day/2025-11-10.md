# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing stability and testing infrastructure, with key bug fixes in `op-faucet` and `cannon`, alongside significant refactoring in `op-devstack` and new test additions for Kona prestate support.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Stability Improvements and Bug Fixes
Critical bug fixes were implemented to enhance the stability of core components. The `op-faucet` now explicitly defines timeouts to prevent test failures on various networks ([#18235](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18235)). Additionally, the `cannon` shutdown process was improved to ensure the preimage server channels are properly closed, resolving issues where `kona-host` would hang indefinitely ([#18229](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18229)).

### Enhanced Testing and Development Infrastructure
Significant work was done to improve the testing framework and development stack. The `op-devstack` was refactored to streamline how L2 forks are required across various acceptance tests ([#18228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18228)). New testing capabilities were added to `cannon-kona`, including support for building and utilizing Kona prestate in dev stack tests, which leverages CircleCI caching for efficiency ([#18144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18144)). Furthermore, a test fix ensures the contract deployer has sufficient ETH for operations in acceptance tests ([#18230](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18230)).

### Codebase Cleanup and Refinement
Efforts were made to streamline the codebase by removing outdated or unused components. Specifically, scripts related to `DeployPreimageOracle` were removed from the `op-deployer` and `contracts-bedrock` packages ([#18151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18151)). Support for L2OO withdrawals was also removed from `op-e2e`, as this configuration has not been in use for a considerable time ([#18201](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18201)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A fix for `contracts-script` to add support for zstd scripts has been proposed ([#18237](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18237)).
- A CI fix aims to disable parallel composite upload for publishing contract artifacts ([#18236](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18236)).
- A new pull request addresses a bug in `op-node` where the L1 origin selector gets stuck on reorgs ([#18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)).
- Improvements to `RLPReader` test coverage and organization within `contracts` are under review ([#18232](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18232)).
- An update to the `op-challenger` docker image to version 1.2.2 of `kona-host` has been submitted ([#18231](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18231)).
