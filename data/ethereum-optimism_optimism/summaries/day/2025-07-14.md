# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in testing infrastructure with new acceptance tests for interop and improvements to Docker build speeds. Bug fixes addressed issues in acceptance tests for the rehearsal 1 devnet, and documentation was streamlined. Several new issues were opened focusing on `op-node` modularization and configuration, while a number of issues related to flashblocks and UX were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing and Build Efficiency
New acceptance tests were introduced for the pre-interop super proposer system, addressing a long-standing issue related to `op-proposer` acceptance tests for interop ([#16674](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16674)). Additionally, Docker build speeds for releases and acceptance tests were improved through layer caching and deprecation fixes ([#16694](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16694)).

### Interoperability Monitoring and Bug Fixes
Bug fixes were implemented for `op-acceptance-tests` related to the rehearsal 1 devnet, ensuring test stability ([#16595](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16595)). The `op-interop-mon` was updated to call `Supervisor SetFailsafeEnabled` upon negative metric signals, enhancing monitoring capabilities ([#16658](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16658)).

### Documentation and Code Clean-up
Outdated entries in the Table of Contents were removed from the documentation, improving accuracy and relevance ([#16635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16635)). An unused `ReadCLIConfig` function was removed from `op-service/tls`, contributing to code cleanliness ([#16622](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16622)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#16692](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16692) `op-node`: cleanup node service/backend setup

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks and Infrastructure Deployment
Several issues related to Flashblocks deployment and infrastructure considerations were closed. This includes the deployment of a flashblocks-websocket-proxy in op-sepolia ([#16686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16686)), enabling flashblocks on sunnyside sequencers ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16688)), and discussions around the need for NVMe node deployment for `op-rbuilders` ([#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16689)) and dedicated namespacing for rbuilders ([#16690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16690)).

### Batcher and Acceptance Test Improvements
An issue concerning the `op-batcher` preventing auto-DA switching to calldata when throttling is activated was closed ([#16691](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16691)). The `op-proposer` acceptance tests for interop were completed and closed ([#15950](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15950)).

### UX and Code Duplication
A UX issue related to nonce errors when approving and executing after one approval was closed ([#1106](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1106)). A duplicate code observation in `op-batcher` was also closed ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16677)).

### Test Porting
The task to port `TestERC20Bridge` to devstack was closed ([#415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/415)).

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-node` Modularity and Configuration
New issues were opened to improve the `op-node`'s architecture, including splitting CLI/entrypoint/service/backend components ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16680)), organizing CLI flags for better categorization and deprecation handling ([#16681](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16681)), improving service configuration by separating it into its own package ([#16682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16682)), and modularizing metrics for better encapsulation and categorization ([#16683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16683)). An overarching issue to improve the `op-node` core setup was also created ([#16679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16679)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Sync Tester Development
Discussion on [#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16452) (`[Tracking] [Sync Tester] op-sync-tester: service for mock EL sync testing`) revolved around session management for the sync tester. @protolambda suggested using HTTP middleware to attach session information to the context based on a unique UUID in the URL, avoiding the need for a special `sync_init` RPC. @pcw109550 proposed an alternative flow involving a `sync_init` RPC to return a session ID, which would then be used to register a new endpoint for stateful proxying of CL requests.

### Interoperability Stress Testing
On [#15285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15285) (`interop: Stress test expiry window`), @pauldowman clarified that the "consolidation step" refers to the final stage in the fault proof program where executing messages are validated after derivation. @mds1 sought clarification on the term.

### `VerifyOPCM` and `DeployImplementations` Integration
Discussion on [#16653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16653) (`Consider making VerifyOPCM a wrapper around DeployImplementations for v2`) saw @maurelian stating that auditors felt `VerifyOPCM` provided redundancy and was complementary to `DeployImplementations.s.sol`. A suggestion was made to re-run `DeployImplementations` within `VerifyOPCM` alongside other checks.

### Invalid Interop Tx Reinjection Test
On [#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16656) (`E2E: Invalid Interop Tx Reinjection Test`), @pcw109550 suggested using `op-test-sequencer` to force include invalid execution messages and then verify reorgs and mempool state. They also referenced a PR for inspecting the mempool and noted the complexity of testing scenarios where interop messages become invalid after dependency updates.
