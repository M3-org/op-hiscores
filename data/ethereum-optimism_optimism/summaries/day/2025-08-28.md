# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Aug 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure with a new flaky test report feature and significant refactoring of sync tester interfaces. Improvements were also made to `op-deployer` for Forge CLI integration and `cannon` for memory optimization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Testing Infrastructure Enhancements
A new feature was added to the `op-acceptance-tests` to generate a flaky test report, improving test reliability and debugging. Additionally, the `op-sync-tester` saw significant refactoring, moving session types and API interfaces to `op-service/eth` to resolve circular dependencies, which will improve the maintainability and robustness of the testing framework.

- [#17252](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17252)

### `op-deployer` Tooling Improvements
The `op-deployer` received updates to integrate a Forge CLI wrapper, streamlining deployment processes. Further enhancements were made to enforce specific Forge versions for `StandardBin`, ensuring consistency and reliability in production deployments.

- [#17242](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17242)

### Cannon Performance Optimization
The `cannon` component saw a crucial optimization with the reduction of heap/code cache size. This change addresses memory constraints, enabling more parallel Cannon instances to run on medium-sized machines, which is vital for efficient fault proof execution.

## NEW ISSUES

### Sync Tester and CI Enhancements
A new issue proposes a nightly CI job for `op-sync-tester` to ensure `op-node` (or other CL) can sync using the latest sync tester, aiming to improve continuous integration and testing.
- [#17253](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17253)

### Dispute Game V2 Development
Several new issues outline the development and integration of version 2 of the FaultDisputeGame (FDG) and PermissionedDisputeGame (PDG). This includes adding new v2 implementations using the CWIA approach, deploying these new implementations via `op-deployer` (feature-flagged), and updating OPCM to use these v2 implementations for `deploy`, `upgrade`, and `addGameType` operations. The long-term plan involves stopping blueprint deployments for FDG/PDG, dropping feature flags to always use v2, and eventually deleting legacy dispute game contracts.

### OPCM Validator Update
An issue was opened to update `OPCMStandardValidator` to correctly handle the new dispute game contracts, as some data previously accessible from v1 implementations will no longer be available in v2.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-acceptance-tests`: Enable Flashblock Tests
The issue [#17248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17248) discusses enabling flashblock tests against persistent devnets. The latest comment from Stevmark11 confirms that the necessary gate is in place and the primary task is to ensure correct functionality, indicating a straightforward implementation.

### CI for `op-geth` PRs
Issue [#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/665) addresses the need for monorepo CI to run on `op-geth` PRs to catch breaking changes early. Ajsutton proposed "Option C": a periodic job in the monorepo to check for the latest `op-geth` commit from the optimism branch, notifying via Slack if it fails. This approach aims to quickly alert to issues, though it might produce false alarms if the job runs between `op-geth` and monorepo PR merges.

### Documentation for `op-deployer`
Issue [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1530) focuses on creating an example for deploying an OP Stack Rollup testnet using `op-deployer`. Krofax provided an update, mentioning a "rich PR" ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705/](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705/)) that overhauls the existing documentation. Previous comments highlighted confusion due to mixed old and new deployment methods, high RPC calls on Alchemy when using permissioned fault proofs, and the current default of `op-deployer` to `FaultDisputeGame` instead of `L2OO`. There was also a discussion about circular dependencies related to prestate hash and chain configuration.
