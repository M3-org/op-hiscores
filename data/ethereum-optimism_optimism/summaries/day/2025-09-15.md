# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on contract enhancements for min-base-fee, bug fixes in the op-deployer, and significant updates to testing infrastructure. Several issues related to flashblocks and system configurations were closed, while new issues emerged concerning rollup-boost as a flashblocks forwarder.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Contract Enhancements for Min-Base-Fee
A new feature was added to the `contracts-bedrock` package, enabling minimum base fee functionality. This involved changes to `ISystemConfig.sol`, `DeployConfig.s.sol`, and `SystemConfig.sol`, along with corresponding snapshot and test updates. This work is a cherry-pick from a larger PR, broken down for easier review. ([#17330](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17330))

### `op-deployer` Bug Fixes and Address Management
A bug in `op-deployer` was fixed to ensure the default cache directory exists, preventing downstream failures. Additionally, the `op-deployer` was updated to read addresses directly from on-chain instead of relying on static `chainConfig` files, preparing for the removal of hardcoded addresses. ([#17411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17411), [#17456](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17456))

### Testing Infrastructure Improvements
Significant updates were made to the testing framework. A new `just latest-versions` recipe was introduced to easily retrieve stable and latest component versions. The `op-acceptance-tests` were refined by removing the `INITIAL_L2_BLOCK` variable and simplifying sync tests with external nodes, now fetching the latest block number from the EL node. ([#17399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17399), [#17453](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17453))

### Code Cleanup and Task Removal
A task related to the reverse proxy websockets implementation was removed from `op-devstack`, as it will not be implemented, contributing to overall code cleanup. ([#17452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17452))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#17450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17450) Dynamic cancellation non-nested timelock
- [#17454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17454) Add minimal cancellation function relying on Safe logic

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Testing and Evaluation
Several issues related to flashblocks testing and partner support criteria on `eris-0` were closed. This includes the completion of load testing on devnets and the evaluation of partner support criteria, with results documented in Notion. ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16756), [#16765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16765))

### System Configuration and Feature Implementation
The issue concerning the addition of a `minBaseFee` configuration variable to the `SystemConfig` contract was closed, indicating the successful implementation of this feature. ([#16839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16839))

### Websockets Implementation Decision
The issue tracking the implementation of Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy was closed, with the decision not to implement this feature. ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17194))

### Component Versioning Clarity
An issue seeking an easy way to get the latest version numbers for OP Stack components was closed, likely addressed by the new `just latest-versions` recipe. ([#17396](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17396))

## NEW ISSUES

### Rollup-Boost as Flashblocks Forwarder
A series of new issues were opened to explore and implement `rollup-boost` as a flashblocks forwarder. This includes initial investigation into its role as a flashblocks forwarder ([#17457](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17457)), deployment plans for `eris-0` ([#17458](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17458)), Sepolia ([#17459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17459)), and mainnet ([#17460](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17460)).

### Deployment and Load Testing for Rollup-Boost on Eris-0
Specific issues were created for the deployment setup ([#17461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17461)) and load testing ([#17462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17462)) of `rollup-boost` as a flashblocks forwarder on `eris-0`, outlining scenarios for testing and performance comparison.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Receipt Correction: Failed to decode RLP receipts ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/679))
The issue reports Geth crashing with "Receipt Correction: Failed to decode RLP receipts" during full sync on op-mainnet. The team confirmed experiencing this issue during snap-syncing an op-mainnet node and is investigating. A potential fix has been proposed and is awaiting testing by the reporter.

### Dispute game creator pattern refactor: update specs ([#17436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17436))
This issue calls for updating specifications to reflect changes in dispute game contract parameters, specifically checking references to constructor and `implArgs`. There's a question about whether this is a duplicate of an older issue or requires a more in-depth analysis.
