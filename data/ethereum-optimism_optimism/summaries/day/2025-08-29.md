# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Aug 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw critical bug fixes in `op-devstack` for improved stability, alongside new integration tests for `op-deployer`. Development also focused on preparing for the Kona + Cannon upgrade with numerous new issues opened for game type, tooling, and infrastructure support.
## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Stability and Testing Enhancements
- Fixed flakiness in `op-devstack`'s `AwaitTimestamp` function by ensuring the waiter specifically targets the block where the fork should activate, improving test reliability ([#17270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17270)).
- Enabled the embedded artifacts integration test for `op-deployer` across all branches, ensuring consistent testing of contract deployments ([#17276](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17276)).

### Contract Simplification
- Simplified the `LivenessModule2.sol` contract by replacing a `for` loop with a `while` loop and making `sentinel` a constant, improving code readability and potentially efficiency ([#17277](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17277)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#17269](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17269) proposes making the data availability footprint configurable.
- [#17272](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17272) introduces a draft implementation for `LivenessModule2`.
- [#17274](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17274) aims to fix an issue where `Value` is not propagated for `BroadcastCreate` transactions in `op-deployer`.
- [#17279](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17279) suggests updating the `op-geth` dependency.
- [#17290](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17290) introduces `PermissionedDisputeGame v2` for proofs.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Public Enablement
- Coordinated and completed GTM tasks for the public enablement of Flashblocks, including documentation and coordination with RaaS providers ([#17027](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17027)).
- Reviewed and finalized public documentation drafts for Flashblocks ([#17141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17141)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Kona + Cannon Upgrade Preparation
- Multiple issues were opened to prepare for the Kona + Cannon upgrade, including adding a new game type in `Types.sol` ([#17282](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17282)), integrating standard prestates into tooling ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17283)), and developing tools for prestate verification ([#17284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17284)).
- Further issues address support for Kona + Cannon in `OPContractsManager` ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17285)), `op-dispute-mon` ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17286)), runbook updates ([#17287](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17287)), and Kubernetes support ([#17288](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17288)).

### Data Availability Footprint Configuration
- New issues were created to implement and test configurable data availability footprint limits, including writing an acceptance test ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17278)) and updating `SystemConfig` for DA footprint gas scalar updates ([#17280](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17280)).

### User Support
- An inquiry was opened regarding funds sent to an unknown address on Optimism Mainnet, indicating a user support request ([#17273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17273)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Deprecating Req-Resp P2P Sync ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14108))
Discussion continues on deprecating the request-response P2P sync in `op-node`. @tessr provided extensive context and ideas from @emilianobonassi regarding an alternate unsafe block sync mechanism. This alternative is highlighted as cheaper, simpler, faster for scale-out and recovery, and more robust than the current P2P approach, which suffers from issues like UDP networking complexities, static IP limitations, and race conditions. The proposed alternative involves a centralized driver where the sequencer leader publishes the latest unsafe block via Redis, and other nodes subscribe and inject it via `admin_postUnsafePayload`. On restarts, a sidecar checks sync status against the sequencer leader and fetches blocks from the EL. This method is complementary and does not replace P2P entirely.

### Min-Base-Fee Specification ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/742))
This issue was closed as the specification for `min-base-fee` has been completed and merged via [#747](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/747). Previously, there was a discussion about computing a rough estimate for the state growth implied by this feature, which was later decided to be better placed in the FMA and tracked in a separate design-docs issue.
