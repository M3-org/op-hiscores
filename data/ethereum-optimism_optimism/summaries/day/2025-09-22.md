# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 22, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing acceptance tests for custom gas tokens, refining smart contracts, and streamlining deployment processes. Several issues related to Interop Acceptance Tests and rollup-boost deployments were closed, while new issues emerged concerning flaky tests and the OP Supernode.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Custom Gas Token Acceptance Tests & Contract Refinements
New acceptance tests for Custom Gas Tokens (CGT) were added, covering introspection, L1 portal introspection, native payment, and various revert scenarios ([#17451](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17451)). Additionally, an errant comment in `OptimismPortal2.sol` was fixed ([#17482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17482)), and the `SystemConfig` code was simplified based on audit findings ([#17539](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17539)).

### Streamlined Deployment and Test Management
The `ReadImplementationAddresses.s.sol` script was simplified for better readability and consistency ([#17542](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17542)). The `DeployOPChain.s.sol` script was updated to allow arbitrary gas limits, moving away from a hardcoded 60Mgas/block limit ([#17550](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17550)). Furthermore, Interop Acceptance Tests were skipped due to flakiness and lack of current production value ([#17555](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17555)), and Isthmus-related acceptance tests were integrated into the base gate ([#17514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17514)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#17552](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17552) `opcm: Add new v2 dispute game implementation fields` was opened to introduce new fields for the v2 dispute game implementation.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interop and Rollup-Boost Deployments Finalized
Several issues related to the Interop POC implementation and rollup-boost deployments were closed. This includes completing the Interop POC implementation and deployment to devnet ([#17190](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17190)), and finalizing the setup of rollup-boost as a flashblocks forwarder on eris-0 ([#17461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17461)), Sepolia ([#17459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17459)), and Mainnet ([#17460](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17460)).

### Development Tooling and Audit Resolution
The issue of adding `op-test-sequencer` to the devnet environment and Kurtosis was closed ([#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15265)), with the decision to move away from Kurtosis. The tracking issue for `op-up` was also closed ([#17000](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17000)), indicating progress on this tool. Additionally, a divergence report from ImmuneFi was resolved ([#17224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17224)).

### DA Footprint Limit Specification
The issue concerning the specification for the DA Footprint Limit was closed ([#17087](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17087)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Flaky Test Investigations
New issues were opened to address persistent flakiness in various tests, including `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` ([#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17548)), `TestSubProcess` ([#17553](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17553)), and `TestQueue_Send_MaxPendingMetrics` ([#17554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17554)).

### OP Supernode Development and Tracking
Several issues were created to track and implement the OP Supernode initiative, including a general tracking issue ([#17556](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17556)) and a specific milestone for its development ([#17558](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17558)).

### Protocol and Contract Refinements
A new issue was opened to complete the implementation of the DA Footprint Limit ([#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17551)). Another issue proposes refactoring super dispute game contracts for reusability across chains ([#17561](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17561)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### ChainConfig.BlobConfig Default Behavior
Issue [#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/685) highlights that `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` always uses default configurations instead of the actual config contents. The latest comment from `geoknee` on 2025-09-22T15:34:49Z indicates that this issue was fixed upstream in `go-ethereum` ([https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/32579](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/32579)) and should be resolved with the next upstream merge.
