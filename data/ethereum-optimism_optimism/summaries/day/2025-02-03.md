# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Feb 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The primary development focus for the day was on addressing sync problems within the `op-node` by proposing the removal of the `req-resp` P2P sync protocol. A new issue was opened to track this significant change, with detailed discussions on alternative unsafe block sync mechanisms.

## NEW ISSUES

### Deprecation of `req-resp` P2P Sync
A new issue was opened to track the removal of the `req-resp` P2P sync protocol from `op-node` to resolve existing sync problems.
- The issue references a design document outlining the deprecation.
- Related `op-node` CLI flags will also be deprecated.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Discussion on `op-node` Sync Protocol Alternatives
Discussions on issue [#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14108) centered on the benefits of an alternative unsafe block sync mechanism prototyped by @emilianobonassi, compared to the existing `req-resp` over P2P.
- **Cost and Simplicity:** The proposed alternative is described as cheaper and simpler to run, requiring fewer components and simpler networking due to avoiding UDP and its associated issues (e.g., NAT punching, lack of domain name support).
- **Faster Scale Out and Recovery:** `req-resp` is noted for being slow, particularly for syncing small ranges of unsafe blocks, and suffers from race conditions that can lead to instability and slow convergence, especially with multiple nodes. The alternative aims to improve this.
- **Complementary Approach:** The proposed alternative is complementary to P2P, allowing for multiple "drivers" to gossip blocks.
- **Centralized Driver Mechanism:** One proposed driver involves the sequencer leader publishing the latest unsafe block via Redis, with other nodes subscribing and injecting payloads via `admin_postUnsafePayload`. On restarts, a sidecar checks sync status against the sequencer leader and queries the EL for blocks.
