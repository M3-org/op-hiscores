# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 21, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `op-deployer` with new verification capabilities and critical bug fixes across the `op-node` and CI/CD pipelines. Significant progress was made in improving the developer experience and ensuring system stability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Contract Verification with Forge
The `op-deployer` now supports `forge verify`, significantly improving the contract verification process. This feature integrates `forge` for verifying contracts, streamlining deployment and ensuring greater transparency and reliability for developers. This work involved extensive changes to the `op-deployer/pkg` directory, including new verification artifacts, constructor handling, and Etherscan/Blockscout integration. ([#18096](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18096))

### Critical Bug Fixes for Node Stability and CI/CD
Several crucial bug fixes were implemented to enhance the stability of the `op-node` and improve the reliability of CI/CD pipelines. A fix was applied to the `op-node/rollup/derive` module to correctly handle too old batch epochs, preventing issues when span batches overlap the safe chain. Additionally, CI/CD jobs were stabilized by addressing a "Text file busy" race condition in the heavy fuzz nightly job and reducing per-package timeouts in `op-acceptance-tests`. ([#18283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18283), [#18351](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18351), [#18349](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18349))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Contract Verification Improvements Completed
Significant progress has been made in contract verification, with the implementation of `forge verify` in the `op-deployer`. This addresses long-standing requests for improved verification capabilities, including support for Blockscout and a more robust verification process. The new approach leverages `forge verify-contract`, reducing the need for custom verification code. ([#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14813), [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17218))

## NEW ISSUES

### Potential Sequencer Bug Identified
A new issue has been opened regarding a possible bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recover mode. This was observed on a partner's testnet where recover mode was enabled during normal operation, leading to unexpected logs on verifier nodes. ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18350))
