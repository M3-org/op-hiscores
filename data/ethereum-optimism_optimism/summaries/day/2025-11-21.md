# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `op-deployer` with Forge verification capabilities, crucial for contract security and transparency. Significant bug fixes were also implemented in `op-node` for batch handling and in CI configurations to improve reliability and efficiency.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Contract Verification with Forge
The `op-deployer` tool received a major feature update, enabling contract verification using Forge. This integration streamlines the process of verifying deployed contracts, improving transparency and security within the Optimism ecosystem. The update involved extensive changes across the `op-deployer/pkg` directory, including new files for Forge client integration, verification artifacts, and constructor handling. ([#18096](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18096))

### Critical Bug Fixes for Node Stability and CI Reliability
Several important bug fixes were deployed today. The `op-node` now correctly handles "too old" batch epochs, preventing potential issues when span batches overlap with the safe chain. Additionally, CI jobs, specifically the `contracts-bedrock-heavy-fuzz-nightly` job, were fixed to prevent "Text file busy" errors by ensuring dependencies are installed before tests run. The `op-acceptance-tests` also saw reduced per-package timeouts to align better with CircleCI's limits. ([#18283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18283), [#18351](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18351), [#18349](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18349))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#18354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18354) Optimize and clarify Solidity style guide: This PR aims to improve the Solidity style guide for better code consistency and readability.
- [#18353](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18353) Remove majority rule: This PR proposes the removal of a "majority rule" mechanism, though further context is needed to understand its implications.
- [#18352](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18352) feat(op-deployer): forge verify (#18096): This PR is a follow-up or re-submission of the `op-deployer` Forge verification feature, indicating its importance and ongoing development.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Contract Verification Enhancements
Two long-standing issues related to contract verification were closed today, indicating significant progress in this area. The primary issue, [#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14813), focused on general contract verification improvements, including support for Blockscout and the integration of a common interface for different client types. This issue was closed following the implementation of Forge binary support, which allows `op-deployer` to shell out to `forge verify-contract` for verification against Etherscan and Blockscout. The related issue, [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17218), specifically addressed converting contract verification logic to use Forge, and was closed as completed under [#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14813).

## NEW ISSUES

### Potential `op-node` Sequencer Bug
A new issue, [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18350), reports a possible bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recover mode. The issue describes a scenario where recover mode was enabled during normal operation on a partner's testnet, leading to verifier nodes logging unexpected behavior.
