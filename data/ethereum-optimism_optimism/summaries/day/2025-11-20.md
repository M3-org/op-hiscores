# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)

## OVERVIEW

Today's development focused on enhancing smart contract functionality with new dispute game components, improving `op-validator` support for contract versions, and refining CI/CD processes. Significant work was also done on upgrading `op-geth` and enforcing shell script formatting.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Smart Contract Enhancements for Dispute Games
New features were added to the smart contracts, including the integration of `op-succinct` contracts for a new dispute game type, complete with access control, error definitions, and an external verifier interface ([#18277](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18277)). The AnchorStateRegistry was also updated to expose the `startingAnchorRoot` property ([#18343](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18343)).

### Validator and CI/CD Improvements
The `op-validator` now supports contracts v5.0.0 ([#18299](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18299)). CI/CD processes were refined with branch restrictions and label overrides for artifact fallback ([#18330](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18330)), and Slack notifications were configured for scheduled sync tests ([#18341](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18341)).

### Core Infrastructure Upgrades and Tooling
An upgrade to `op-geth` was implemented ([#18214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18214)), and a new `check-jovian` command was added to `op-chain-ops` ([#18269](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18269)). Shell script formatting was standardized across the repository using `shfmt` ([#18329](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18329)).

### Enhanced Test Coverage
Comprehensive test coverage was added for the `Constants` library ([#18267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18267)), and fuzz tests were introduced to enhance `LegacyMessagePasser` test coverage ([#18340](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18340)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Batcher Throughput and Alerting
The issue concerning a runbook for low batcher throughput ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16959)) has been closed. A runbook was created to address scenarios where `MinBaseFee` might be too high, leading to transaction inclusion issues.

### Geth Upstream Merge
The issue tracking the `geth` v1.16.4 upstream merge ([#18217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18217)) has been closed, indicating the successful integration of the upstream changes.

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-deployer` and Artifact Management
A new issue highlights the need to deprecate non-forge artifact setup in `op-deployer` ([#18346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18346)). The current setup requires the entire folder with Solidity source files, making non-forge compatible artifacts ultimately fail.

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency
An issue has been opened to remove the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry` ([#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18347)). The current check for `anchorStateRegistry()` via a cast to `IFaultDisputeGame` will not work for all game types.
