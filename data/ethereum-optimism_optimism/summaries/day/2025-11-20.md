# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant advancements in Optimism's dispute game infrastructure with the addition of new succinct contracts and enhanced validator support. Key updates also include improvements to the AnchorStateRegistry and a major upgrade to op-geth, alongside various testing and CI/CD enhancements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dispute Game and Validator Enhancements
- Introduced new OP_SUCCINCT contracts, including an access control contract, error and type definitions, an external verifier interface, and the OPSuccinctFaultDisputeGame, laying groundwork for new dispute game types ([#18277](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18277)).
- Added support for contracts v5.0.0 to `op-validator`, ensuring compatibility with the latest contract versions ([#18299](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18299)).
- Updated the AnchorStateRegistry to expose the `startingAnchorRoot` property, enhancing transparency and functionality ([#18343](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18343)).

### Core Infrastructure Upgrades and Tooling
- Performed a significant upgrade of `op-geth`, incorporating upstream changes and improvements ([#18214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18214)).
- Introduced `shfmt` for deterministic shell script formatting across the repository, improving code consistency ([#18329](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18329)).
- Added a `check-jovian` command to `op-chain-ops` for verifying Jovian-related configurations ([#18269](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18269)).
- Modified `op-deployer` to activate the Jovian hardfork at genesis by default for new chains, streamlining deployment ([#18342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18342)).

### Testing and CI/CD Improvements
- Enhanced test coverage for the `Constants` library with comprehensive tests for all constants and the `DEFAULT_RESOURCE_CONFIG()` function ([#18267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18267)).
- Improved `LegacyMessagePasser` test coverage by converting a single hardcoded test to a comprehensive fuzz test ([#18340](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18340)).
- Fixed CI configuration to add branch restrictions and label overrides for artifact fallback, improving build reliability ([#18330](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18330)).
- Configured Slack notifications for `scheduled-sync-test-op-node` failures in CircleCI ([#18341](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18341)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Batcher Throughput and Min-Base-Fee Runbook
- A runbook was created to address low batcher throughput when `MinBaseFee` is set too high, including alerting mechanisms to detect such scenarios ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16959)).

### Geth Upstream Merge
- The issue tracking the merge of `geth` v1.16.4 upstream changes has been closed, indicating successful integration ([#18217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18217)).

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-deployer` Artifact Handling
- A new issue highlights the need to deprecate non-forge artifact setup in `op-deployer`, as current forge requirements necessitate the presence of the entire folder with Solidity source files ([#18346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18346)).

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency
- An issue was opened regarding the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency in `AnchorStateRegistry`, noting that the current sanity check for `anchorStateRegistry()` will not work for all game types ([#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18347)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `IFaultDisputeGame` Dependency in AnchorStateRegistry ([#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18347))
The discussion revolves around the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency in `AnchorStateRegistry` and the `anchorStateRegistry()` method.
- **Inphi** suggested expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface to require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method to maintain the sanity check.
- **ajsutton** questioned the necessity of the sanity check, pointing out that deployment-time checks via `OPStandardValidator` already ensure the correct `ASR` is used.
- **ajsutton** further noted that adding `wasRespectedAtGameCreation` already ties dispute game implementations to the anchor state registry, potentially making the current dependency less problematic.
