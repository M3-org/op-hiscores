# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, particularly addressing flashblocks handler leaks and integrating missing custom gas token commits. Significant effort was also put into enhancing test coverage and stability for the `op-node` and `op-acceptance-tests`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Critical Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements
Several crucial bug fixes were implemented to enhance the stability and reliability of the Optimism stack. This includes resolving flashblocks handler leaks in `op-conductor` ([#18506](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18506)) and picking up missing Custom Gas Token (CGT) commits to ensure proper functionality across various contract tests ([#18560](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18560)). Additionally, compiler warnings were enforced and test return values were fixed in `contracts-bedrock` ([#18567](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18567)).

### Enhanced Testing and Acceptance Test Stability
Efforts were made to improve the robustness of the testing infrastructure. New tests were added to `op-node` to cover future/unknown `SystemConfig` events, ensuring better forward compatibility ([#18566](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18566)). The `op-acceptance-tests` also received an update to include a pending nonce busy wait for the batcher, addressing flakiness in `TestBatcherFullChannelsAfterDowntime` ([#18564](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18564)). Furthermore, `op-acceptor` was updated to v3.8.1 ([#18563](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18563)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Kona Monorepo Integration**: Two pull requests, [#18569](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18569) and [#18568](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18568), propose upstreaming `op-rs/kona` into the monorepo.
- **New Feature: SuperFaultDisputeGameV2**: A new feature to add `SuperFaultDisputeGameV2` has been introduced in [#18565](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18565).

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### P2P Connection Flakiness in System Tests
A new issue, [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18570), reports flakiness in `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` P2P connections within system tests. This is observed in presets containing mixed `op-geth/op-reth` nodes or multiple `op-reth` nodes, potentially impacting test stability and production compatibility.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-node` Sequencer Recover Mode Bug
Discussion continues on [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18350) regarding a possible bug in `op-node`'s sequencer recover mode. The latest comments highlight that the sequencer, when in recover mode during normal operation, might request an L1 origin block that doesn't yet exist, leading to a "not found" error. This prevents the L1 origin from advancing and can violate the sequencer drift rule, potentially stalling derivation if a bad batch gets on L1. A relevant PR ([#18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)) was identified, and the influence of async L1 origin fetching ([#12134](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/12134)) is being investigated as a potential factor. Possible fixes are being explored to prevent temporary errors when recover mode catches up to the tip.
