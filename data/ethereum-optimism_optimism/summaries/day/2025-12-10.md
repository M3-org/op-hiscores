# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, particularly addressing flashblocks handler leaks and picking missing Custom Gas Token (CGT) commits. Significant testing enhancements were also implemented to improve system robustness.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Critical Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements
Several crucial bug fixes were implemented to enhance the stability and reliability of the Optimism ecosystem. This includes resolving flashblocks handler leaks in `op-conductor` ([#18506](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18506)) and picking up missing Custom Gas Token (CGT) commits, which involved extensive updates across `contracts-bedrock` and `op-acceptance-tests` ([#18560](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18560)). Additionally, compiler warnings were enforced and test return values were fixed in `contracts-bedrock` ([#18567](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18567)).

### Enhanced Testing and Acceptance Test Suite
Efforts were made to bolster the testing infrastructure. New tests were added to `op-node` to cover future/unknown `SystemConfig` events, improving the protocol's resilience to unexpected configurations ([#18566](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18566)). The `op-acceptance-tests` suite received an update to include a pending nonce busy wait for the batcher, addressing flakiness in `TestBatcherFullChannelsAfterDowntime` ([#18564](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18564)). The `op-acceptor` was also updated to v3.8.1 ([#18563](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18563)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Kona Monorepo Upstreaming**: Two pull requests, [#18569](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18569) and [#18568](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18568), were opened to upstream `op-rs/kona` into the monorepo.
- **SuperFaultDisputeGameV2 Feature**: A new feature to add `SuperFaultDisputeGameV2` was proposed in [#18565](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18565).

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### P2P Connection Flakiness in System Tests
A new issue, [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18570), was opened to address flakiness in `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` P2P connections within the `op-devstack` system tests. This issue is critical as it impacts the stability of the test environment and potentially production compatibility between different client implementations.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-node Sequencer Recover Mode Bug ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18350))
Discussion continues on a possible bug in `op-node`'s sequencer recover mode. The latest comment from `geoknee` on December 10, 2025, points to a potentially relevant PR ([#18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)). Previous discussions highlighted that when the sequencer is in recover mode during normal operation, it might request an L1 origin block that doesn't yet exist, leading to "not found" errors. This prevents the L1 origin from advancing and can violate the sequencer drift rule, potentially stalling derivation if a bad batch gets on L1. Potential fixes and the influence of asynchronous L1 origin fetching are still under investigation.
