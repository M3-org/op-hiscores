# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Aug 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, significant code refactoring to streamline event handling, and robust test enhancements across the `op-node`, `op-sync-tester`, and `op-acceptance-tests` modules.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Protocol Stability & Bug Fixes
A critical bug in `op-service/eth` related to execution payload creation from blocks was fixed, ensuring correct block processing and chain synchronization. This involved updating the `op-geth` dependency. ([#17154](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17154))

### Event System Refactoring & Simplification
Significant progress was made in simplifying the event system within `op-node`. The `PromoteSafeEvent`, `PendingSafeRequestEvent`, and `PromoteFinalizedEvent` were removed, reducing complexity and improving code maintainability. This refactoring impacts various components including `l2_verifier`, `engine_controller`, and `driver`. ([#17161](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17161), [#17122](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17122), [#17165](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17165))

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
Several new tests were added and existing ones migrated to improve coverage and reliability. This includes backporting the `VerifyOPCM` test for `contracts-bedrock`, fully implementing and testing the `eth` namespace in `op-sync-tester`, and migrating `TestInteropReadiness` to the `op-devstack` framework for `op-acceptance-tests`. ([#17110](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17110), [#17117](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17117), [#17160](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17160))

### Conductor Scenario Improvements
Updates were made to the `op-conductor` to address scenarios where a sequencer is healthy but its builder is not, improving the robustness of rollupboost healing. ([#17158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17158))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-sync-tester` `eth` Namespace Support
The issue tracking the implementation of `eth` namespace support in `op-sync-tester` has been closed. This work involved serving `eth_getBlockReceipts`, `eth_getBlockByHash`, and `eth_getBlockByNumber` methods. ([#16700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16700))

## NEW ISSUES

### Flashblocks Spec Finalization
A new issue has been opened to track the finalization of the Flashblocks specification, supporting Flashbots in closing out their existing PR. ([#17162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17162))

### `op-up` Usage Metrics Reporting
A new issue proposes adding usage metrics reporting to `op-up` to better track the success of the local chain flow, addressing current limitations in relying solely on website metrics. ([#17164](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17164))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Event System Refactoring Progress
Issue [#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17001) is actively tracking the removal of two events from the event system. Recent comments indicate significant progress, with PRs [#16997](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16997), [#17161](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17161), [#17122](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17122), and [#17165](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17165) addressing the removal of `PromoteSafeEvent`, `PendingSafeRequestEvent`, and `PromoteFinalizedEvent`. The issue was closed on Aug 21, 2025, indicating completion.

### RPC Response Content Type Missing
Issue [#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/389) continues to be active, discussing the missing content type in RPC responses for `eth` queries from OP Chain A and B. A new comment from OBlackmon3 on Aug 20, 2025, asks for guidance on suggesting a fix, indicating ongoing community engagement and a desire to resolve this long-standing issue. The problem is noted to potentially affect how Wagmi reads `eth_getTransactionReceipt`.
