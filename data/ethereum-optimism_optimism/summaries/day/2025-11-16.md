## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Kona Component Updates and Integration
The `kona` component received significant updates, with its version being upgraded to 1.2.4. This update also enabled cannon-kona acceptance tests, leveraging new websocket support in `kona`. The `op-challenger` docker image was also updated to include `kona-host` version 1.2.2.
