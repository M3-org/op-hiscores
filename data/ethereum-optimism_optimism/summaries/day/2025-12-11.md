# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `OPContractsManagerV2` with custom gas token support, integrating Forge test results into CI, and laying the groundwork for the `op-interop-filter` service. Significant work was also done on `op-deployer` to support the `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrade.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Contracts and Deployment Enhancements
A new feature was added to `OPContractsManagerV2` to support custom gas tokens, allowing for more flexible gas management within the system ([#18455](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18455)). Additionally, the `op-deployer` was updated to support the `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrade, ensuring compatibility with the latest contract versions ([#18580](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18580)).

### Interoperability and CI Improvements
The skeleton for the `op-interop-filter` service was introduced, including CLI flags and metrics, which is a foundational step for future interoperability features ([#18456](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18456)). Continuous Integration (CI) was improved by integrating Forge test results with CircleCI, making it easier to identify and debug test failures ([#18579](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18579)). Further CI changes and artifact publishing scripts were cherry-picked to streamline the development workflow ([#18546](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18546)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new feature to have `OPCMv2` check upgrade ordering version was opened ([#18583](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18583)).
- A pull request to remove the dead `advertisedAddr` field from `op-conductor` was initiated ([#18582](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18582)).
- A dependabot PR was opened to bump `github.com/quic-go/quic-go` from version 0.46.0 to 0.57.0 ([#18578](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18578)).
- An initialization pull request was opened ([#18573](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18573)).

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES

### Interoperability and Protocol Evaluation
A new issue was opened to evaluate and rework injected replacement transactions within the interop system, specifically addressing how the protocol handles invalid interop transactions and the role of replacement blocks ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574)).

### Monorepo Migration Tracking
Several issues were created to track the migration of `kona` and `op-reth` crates into the monorepo, aiming to consolidate the OP Stack crates ([#18575](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18575), [#18576](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18576), [#18577](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18577)).

### Node Synchronization and Fault Dispute Game Cleanup
An issue was reported regarding node synchronization problems, with users experiencing "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581)). Additionally, a follow-up issue was created to remove V2 FaultDisputeGame contracts and clean up related references ([#18584](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18584)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Node Synchronization Challenges ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581))
Users are reporting issues with node synchronization, specifically "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. Initial discussions suggest these errors might stem from the L1 Execution Client (e.g., Geth or Erigon) failing to provide necessary state data to the Op-Node for L2 block creation. One user noted similar problems with Publicnode snapshots but found success with `snapsync` using `--syncmode=execution-layer` for a new Unichain node. Another user reported the same errors across multiple Base/Optimism/Unichain nodes running `op-geth` and `op-node` with snapshots from publicnode.com. A maintainer requested more information, including client configurations (L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client), full logs for Op-Node and L1 Execution Client, and complete flag lists for all three clients, to aid in diagnosis.

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574))
The discussion revolves around the protocol's handling of invalid interop transactions via "Replacement Blocks" and the necessity of an additional transaction to record the replaced block hash for the proofs system. A key point raised is that this additional transaction is critical for the proofs system to avoid overwhelming honest challengers with work, as it prevents the need to re-run derivation to identify the original block hash. It was argued that the fixed gas cost of the inserted transaction and the reserved gas for system transactions (enforced by `SystemConfig`) mitigate the risk of exceeding the block gas limit. Conversely, there's a suggestion that the Supernode should be capable of generating the necessary data for proof, potentially simplifying the protocol by not requiring the extra deposit transaction.
