# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `OPContractsManagerV2` with custom gas token support, integrating Forge test results into CI, and laying the groundwork for the `op-interop-filter` service. Significant work was also done on `op-deployer` to support the `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrade.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Contracts and Deployment Enhancements
A new feature was added to `OPContractsManagerV2` to support custom gas tokens, allowing for more flexible gas management within the system ([#18455](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18455)). Additionally, the `op-deployer` was updated to support the `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrade, ensuring compatibility with the latest contract versions ([#18580](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18580)).

### Interoperability and CI Improvements
The foundational skeleton for the `op-interop-filter` service was introduced, including CLI flags and metrics, which is crucial for future cross-chain interoperability ([#18456](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18456)). Furthermore, CI configurations were updated to generate XML test results for Forge tests, improving feedback and debugging for developers ([#18579](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18579)).

### CI/CD Pipeline Refinements
Several CI changes and the `push-artifacts.sh` script were cherry-picked, streamlining the continuous integration and deployment processes ([#18546](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18546)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Feature Development:** A new pull request, [#18583](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18583), proposes a feature for `OPCMv2` to check upgrade ordering versions.
- **Code Cleanup:** Pull request [#18582](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18582) aims to remove a dead `advertisedAddr` field from `op-conductor`.
- **Dependency Updates:** A dependabot PR, [#18578](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18578), suggests bumping `github.com/quic-go/quic-go` from version 0.46.0 to 0.57.0.
- **Initialization:** A pull request titled "init" ([#18573](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18573)) was opened, likely for initial setup or a new component.

## NEW ISSUES

### Interoperability and Protocol Design
A new issue, [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574), was opened to evaluate and rework injected replacement transactions within the interop system, specifically concerning invalid interop transactions and replacement blocks.

### Monorepo Migration Tracking
Several issues were created to track the migration of Rust crates into the monorepo:
- [#18575](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18575) is a tracking issue for migrating `kona` and other OP Stack crates.
- [#18576](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18576) specifically targets the migration of `kona` into the monorepo.
- [#18577](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18577) focuses on migrating `op-reth` `optimism` crates into the monorepo, following the pattern of the `kona` migration.

### Node Synchronization and Fault Dispute Game Cleanup
- Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581) reports a problem with node synchronization.
- Issue [#18584](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18584) proposes removing V2 FaultDisputeGame contracts, following up on a previous issue to clean up references to V1 dispute games.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Node Synchronization Issues ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581))
Users are reporting issues with nodes not synchronizing, specifically encountering "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. These errors suggest that the L1 Execution Client (e.g., Geth or Erigon) might not be providing the necessary state data to the Op-Node for L2 block creation. One user mentioned having the same problem with Publicnode snapshots but found success with `snapsync` using `--syncmode=execution-layer` for a new Unichain node. Another user reported similar errors across Base, Optimism, and Unichain nodes running `op-geth` with `op-node v1.16.3` and `op-geth v1.101603.5 jovian`, attempting to sync with publicnode.com snapshots. The latest comment from rdin777 requests more information to diagnose the problem, including client configurations (L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client), full logs for Op-Node and L1 Execution Client, and full flag lists for all three clients.

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574))
Discussion revolves around the necessity and implications of the additional transaction for proofs when a replacement block is inserted due to an invalid interop transaction. `ajsutton` argues that the additional transaction recording the replaced block hash is critical for the proofs system to prevent overwhelming honest challengers and that there's no real risk of exceeding the block gas limit. `axelKingsley` questions why the Supernode couldn't supply the necessary data for proof, suggesting that the Supernode's recorded denylists could act as a "SafeDB" for replacements, potentially simplifying the protocol by not adding an extra deposit transaction. `Inphi` agrees with `axelKingsley` that the Supernode should be able to generate what's needed for proof, despite the need for the additional transaction for proofs, and suggests simplifying the protocol by avoiding the extra deposit transaction.
