# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 25, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on integrating new creator pattern implementations, refining custom gas token features, and enhancing testing infrastructure. Several bug fixes were implemented, and new pull requests were opened to address logging, deployment, and monitoring.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Protocol Enhancements & Bug Fixes
Significant progress was made on integrating new creator pattern implementations for FaultDisputeGameV2 and PermissionedDisputeGameV2, enhancing the core dispute game logic ([#17329](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17329)). A critical bug in `op-devstack` was fixed, ensuring correct finalization waiting behavior ([#17618](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17618)). Additionally, comments and fixes related to the Custom Gas Token (CGT) feature were addressed, improving its stability and integration ([#17612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17612), [#17621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17621)).

### Testing and CI/CD Improvements
New invariant tests were added for Custom Gas Token to ensure supply conservation, mint/withdraw, and burn/deposit consistency ([#17489](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17489)). The `op-acceptor` was updated to v3.3.1, and sync-tester hardfork tests were refactored for better parallel execution in CI ([#17515](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17515), [#17535](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17535)). A temporary disablement of `TestSyncTesterELSync` was implemented due to flakiness, with re-enablement tracked separately ([#17617](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17617)).

### Deployment and Configuration Updates
Support for custom gasLimit was added to `op-deployer`, aligning with `op-contracts/v3.0.1` and enabling more flexible chain deployments ([#17585](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17585)). The `OPContractsManager` was updated to zero out cannon-kona game types during migration when the `CANNON_KONA` dev feature is enabled ([#17523](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17523)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Custom Gas Token Refinements
Several issues related to the Custom Gas Token feature were closed, including a general review ([#17586](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17586)), minor naming conventions ([#17587](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17587)), considerations for explicit custom error cases ([#17588](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17588), [#17601](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17601)), and refactoring test contracts with `skipIfDevFeatureDisabled` ([#17604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17604)).

### Test Suite Improvements
Issues addressing test suite improvements were closed, such as refactoring `OptimismPortal2.t.sol` ([#17593](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17593), [#17591](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17591), [#17592](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17592)), merging `L1Block` tests using `DevFeatures` ([#17596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17596)), removing unnecessary `virtual` tags ([#17595](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17595)), splitting assertions in tests ([#17598](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17598)), and refactoring test initializers ([#17603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17603)).

### Helper Functions and Setup Refactoring
Issues related to code organization and test setup were closed, including adding `_authorizeMinter(_minter)` as a helper function ([#17600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17600)) and replacing `setInputCGTEnabled` modifier with `setUp` in tests ([#17605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17605)).

### Critical Bug Resolution
A critical bug where the recommit mechanism failed due to interrupt signal reuse, leading to degraded transaction throughput, was identified and closed ([#17606](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17606)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Test Flakiness Investigation
An issue was opened to investigate and root cause failures in `TestSyncTesterELSync` within `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17615](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17615)).

### Recommit Mechanism Failure
A new issue was created to address the recommit mechanism in `op-geth` failing due to interrupt signal reuse, resulting in blocks with only one transaction ([#17606](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17606)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fusaka Preparation for op-batcher ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17472))
Discussion continues on preparing `op-batcher` for the Fusaka activation on L1. The key point is that the batcher will need to send blob transactions with *cell proofs* instead of *blob proofs*. A recipe for manual testing against a Fusaka L1 has been shared to aid in this transition.

### Snag Report on Improved Superchain-Ops Flow ([#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1224))
Feedback on the `superchain-ops` signing flow highlights several areas for improvement. Key discussion points include:
- The printing of markdown with 'TODOs' during task simulation: While intended for task developers, it's questioned if this impacts the signer's UX, especially if signers are expected to simulate tasks.
- The experimental nature of audit reports in the workflow: The language around this needs to be clarified as it's not a fully committed feature.
- The necessity of `op-txverify` for all signers: This remains an open decision point.
- The need for clearer markdown and validation for state diffs, particularly for non-OPCM upgrades.
- A request for an explanation of the "normalized state diff hash."
A PR has been raised to address some of these snags.

### Deduplicate Engine API Validations in `Miner.prepareWork` ([#688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/688))
The discussion revolves around the duplication of Engine API validation checks in `Miner.prepareWork` that are already performed in `eth/catalyst/api_optimism.go`. There's a suggestion to move additional checks into the Engine API, such as:
- Optimism chains requiring a force-included L1 attributes deposit transaction.
- Jovian requiring a specific length (178 bytes) for L1 attributes deposit data to extract `daFootprintScalar`.
