## NEW ISSUES
### Kurtosis Devnet Enhancements
A new issue was opened to add support for flashblocks (rollup-boost and rbuilder) to the Kurtosis devnet, ensuring compatibility with an infrastructure topology that includes an `rbuilder` instance per `conductor` instance ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16514)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-supervisor Event Overflow Analysis
Discussions continued on the `op-supervisor` event overflow issue ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16335)). The latest comment from `nonsense` on June 19th, 2025, indicates a pull request ([#16473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16473)) has been added to introduce a gauge for all in-flight events within the `GlobalSyncExec`. This aims to identify which event type causes issues if the overflow recurs. An additional gauge for total in-flight events was also added, with the potential for setting up alerts if a threshold is crossed. Previous discussions debated whether `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` or `"cross-unsafe-update"` events were the primary cause of the stacking.

### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet Clarification
The discussion around the differences between `supersim` and `interop kurtosis devnet` continued ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/399)). On June 19th, 2025, `zhiqiangxu` inquired about the primary use case for `supersim`, following up on a previous comment that described `supersim` as a lighter wrapper around `anvil` for local development.
