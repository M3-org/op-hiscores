# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing efficiency, improving AI contract test maintenance with Slack notifications and bug fixes, and initiating the `op-supernode` Chain Container Framework. Significant progress was also made in fixing acceptance tests for `op-reth` and refining dispute monitoring.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Testing and Code Quality Improvements
Efforts were made to streamline testing processes and improve code quality. This included reducing local fuzz run iterations for faster development cycles ([#17877](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17877)), enhancing `ResourceMetering` test coverage and organization by converting duplicate tests to fuzz tests ([#17812](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17812)), and promoting stable tests from the `flake-shake` gate ([#17851](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17851)). Additionally, solidity upgrade tests were updated for `base ink` and `unichain` ([#17827](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17827)).

### AI Contract Test Maintenance and Bug Fixes
The AI Contract Test Maintenance System received an update to version 1.1.0, introducing Slack notifications for PR creation and critical bug fixes ([#17876](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17876)). A specific fix was also implemented for acceptance tests related to `op-reth`, addressing issues with proof generation window and `getProof` arguments ([#17882](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17882)).

### Supernode and Dispute Monitoring Enhancements
Initial work on the `op-supernode` introduced the Chain Container Framework, enabling multi-tenant Consensus Layer functionality ([#17659](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17659)). The `op-dispute-mon` was updated to consider a node invalid if it hasn't processed L1 past the game head, ensuring accurate rollup node sync status checks ([#17831](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17831)). An unused `superchainProxyAdmin` variable was also removed from `OPContractsManager` ([#17828](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17828)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#17884](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17884): `op-batcher/throttling` will now only shut down on specific "MethodNotFound" RPC errors, otherwise it will retry.
- [#17883](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17883): A new feature to only allow transactions to be scheduled by Safe owners.
- [#17881](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17881): `fakebeacon` is being updated to align its mock behavior with post-Fulu L1 CL.
- [#17880](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17880): `op-conductor` will now use `op-service` HTTP Server for Flashblocks and includes a fix for a test flake.
- [#17875](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17875): Automated flake-shake test promotions for `op-acceptance-tests`.
- [#17874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17874): `opcm` is being updated to use a new upgrade method for `disputegame-v2`.
- [#17873](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17873): Refactoring to improve `SafeSend` test coverage and quality.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dispute Game and Supernode Milestones
The issue regarding the use of v2 dispute game implementation in `OPCM.deploy` has been closed ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17257)). Additionally, Milestone 1 for the `OP Supernode` project has been completed and closed ([#17558](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17558)).

### Flashblocks Readiness and Coordination
Two issues related to Flashblocks have been closed: `Fusaka` readiness for Flashblocks components ([#17853](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17853)) and coordination with Flashblocks RPC providers regarding the new Flashblocks RPC node ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17857)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Rollup Node and Data Availability Concerns
New issues highlight problems with the Sepolia `op-node` failing to get blobs from Caplin ([#17871](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17871)) and a need to investigate upstreaming a Celestia batcher DA size fix ([#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17872)).

### Conductor and Dispute Monitor Optimizations
The `Conductor` needs to allow for auto-assignment of Flashblocks ports to prevent test flakes ([#17879](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17879)). The `dispute-mon` also requires optimization for sync status checks, as `optimism_syncStatus` is currently called too frequently ([#17886](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17886)).

### Operator Fee and GPO Testing
There's a call to add stronger tests for edge cases in Jovian/operator-fee-fix/GPO ([#17887](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17887)) and to revisit a saturating math issue in the `operatorFee` getter ([#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17888)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Block Limit Specs ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/792))
The discussion on this issue, which concerns updating DA footprint block limit specs, was closed today via PR #800. The key point was the decision to use the `blobBaseFee` header field for the new gas-like dimension instead of modifying the `gasUsed` field.
