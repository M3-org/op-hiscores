# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the fault dispute game contracts within `contracts-bedrock`, specifically by modifying how game types are handled. Several new pull requests were opened to address testing and operational fixes, while two issues related to dispute game factory and sequencer startup were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Fault Dispute Game Contract Refinement
The `FaultDisputeGameV2` contracts were updated to pass the game type as a `CWIA` argument instead of a constructor argument. This change allows a single `FaultDisputeGame` deployment to be used for both cannon and cannon-kona, improving flexibility and reducing redundancy. This modification involved changes across multiple files in `packages/contracts-bedrock`, including interfaces, deployment scripts, and test files. ([#17832](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17832))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Testing Infrastructure Improvements:** A new pull request, [#17929](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17929), aims to remove in-test sharding for `op-e2e` tests, relying instead on Makefile package sharding for better test management. Another PR, [#17927](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17927), focuses on making `op-acceptance-tests` more robust by addressing flakiness and improving test promotions.
- **Operational Fixes:** A fix for `op-chain-ops` is proposed in [#17926](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17926) to ensure correct file permissions for `debug_witness.json`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dispute Game Factory Enhancements
An issue concerning the prevention of setting implementation for reserved game types in `DisputeGameFactory` ([#17870](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17870)) was closed. The resolution involved removing the check entirely, as discussed in a related pull request.

### Sequencer Startup Error Resolution
The issue where `op-conductor` failed to start the sequencer with an "no unsafe head" error ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17899)) was closed. This problem occurred after linking the conductor to a previously deployed sequencer.

## NEW ISSUES

### Testing and Migration Improvements
A new issue, [#17928](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17928), highlights the need to avoid mocking in the `test_addGameType_permissionedSuper_succeeds` test within `opcm`. The proposed solution is to run `migrate` before attempting to add super games, eliminating the need for mocking and setting up the necessary environment.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Jovian Rollup Configuration Compatibility
Discussion continues on [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17907) regarding the marshaling of new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SystemConfig` until Jovian is active. The core problem is that introducing new fields breaks existing zk stacks like `op-succinct` and `kailua` which use the rollup configuration for commitment hashing. The latest comments question whether updating `op-succinct/kailua` directly is a better approach than adding a nullable system config, and whether uncoordinated API updates can be justified. The team is considering checking with @emilianobonassi for further input.
