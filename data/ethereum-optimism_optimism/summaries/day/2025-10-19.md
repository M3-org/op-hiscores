# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the fault dispute game contracts, specifically by modifying how game types are handled. Several new pull requests were opened, primarily addressing testing and build process improvements. Two issues were closed, one related to `op-conductor` and another concerning dispute game factory implementation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Fault Dispute Game Contract Refinement
The `FaultDisputeGameV2` contracts were updated to pass the game type as a `CWIA` argument instead of a constructor argument. This change allows a single `FaultDisputeGame` deployment to be used for both cannon and cannon-kona, improving flexibility and reducing redundancy. This modification involved changes across multiple contract files and tests. ([#17832](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17832))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Four new pull requests were opened today, primarily focusing on testing and build system adjustments:
- [#17930](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17930) aims to remove Makefile sharding, relying instead on in-test sharding for `op-e2e`.
- Conversely, [#17929](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17929) proposes removing in-test sharding from `op-e2e` and relying on Makefile package sharding.
- [#17927](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17927) addresses flake-shaking and test promotions within `op-acceptance-tests`.
- [#17926](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17926) focuses on using correct file permissions for `debug_witness.json` in `op-chain-ops`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-conductor` and Dispute Game Factory Issues Resolved
An issue where `op-conductor` failed to start the sequencer due to a "no unsafe head" error was closed. ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17899)) Additionally, an issue preventing the setting of implementation for reserved game types in `DisputeGameFactory` was closed, with the check being entirely removed. ([#17870](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17870))

## NEW ISSUES

### Testing and Migration Improvements
A new issue, [#17928](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17928), was opened to address the need to avoid mocking in the `test_addGameType_permissionedSuper_succeeds` test within `opcm`. The suggestion is to run `migrate` before attempting to add super games to eliminate the need for mocking.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Jovian Rollup Configuration Compatibility
Issue [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17907) discusses the impact of new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` on zk stacks like `op-succinct` and `kailua`. The latest comment questions whether updating `op-succinct/kailua` is a viable alternative to adding a nullable system config, indicating an ongoing discussion about the best approach to maintain compatibility.
