# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jun 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the opening of several new pull requests focusing on deployer validation, PR review policy, dispute game patterns, and test improvements. Multiple new issues were reported, including critical `op-node` goroutine issues and `op-supervisor` event overflow concerns. Discussions continued on existing issues related to CI flakiness, L1 origin handling in `op-supervisor`, and `eth_getTransactionCount` nonce discrepancies.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No completed work was reported for this day.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Four new pull requests were opened today:
- **Deployment and Configuration:** A PR was opened to validate intent overrides within the `op-deployer` component ([#16338](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16338)).
- **Development Process Improvements:** An initial PR review policy was proposed ([#16339](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16339)).
- **Dispute Game Enhancements:** A new feature for a CWIA dispute game creator pattern was introduced ([#16340](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16340)).
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Small improvements to existing tests were submitted ([#16342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16342)).

## CLOSED ISSUES
- **Documentation Updates:** The issue regarding the `L2OutputOracleProxy` not being deployed and `op-deployer` startup failures was closed ([#1614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1614)). The resolution indicated that the L2 Output Oracle is deprecated and the related testnet tutorial is outdated.

## NEW ISSUES
- **Node Stability and Performance:** A critical issue was reported for `op-node` v1.13.3, where thousands of goroutines become stuck in `p2p.SyncClient` and `libp2p` after several hours of uptime, leading to sync failures ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16332)).
- **Supervisor Event Handling:** An issue was opened concerning the `op-supervisor` entering a non-recoverable crash-loop due to event overflow when the unsafe head gap between its log DB and a managed node becomes too large ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16335)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **CI Flakiness Investigation:** Discussions continued on investigating and improving CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16271)). A comment from June 9th highlighted the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests, with `TestSequencingWindowExpiry` and `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` being the most frequent offenders. It was also noted that much of the flakiness is due to infrastructure issues rather than acceptance testing itself.
- **Supervisor L1 Origin Handling:** The issue concerning improving L1 origin validity handling during `op-supervisor` resets saw a comment on June 9th, suggesting that instead of performing walkbacks, all targets provided by the supervisor should be inherently valid. If a target is invalid, the supervisor should realize the L1 chain has changed and provide a new reset, reducing complexity ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16315)).
- **Incorrect Nonce from `eth_getTransactionCount`:** The issue where `eth_getTransactionCount` returns an incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending transactions was commented on June 9th, with a user asking for an update ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/623)).
- **Superchain Interop Environment Quickstart Guide:** Discussions on creating a quickstart guide for the Superchain Interop environment continued ([#1644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1644)). On June 9th, it was suggested that this content would be suitable for a homepage, and a wider lens for its scope would be explored. A draft is expected by June 10th.
- **Complete Withdrawal Flow Test:** Progress was reported on the complete withdrawal flow test ([#327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/327)). On June 9th, it was confirmed that the (sysgo) implementation is complete via [#16333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16333), with two follow-up tickets needed for kt (sysext) support and a devnet-specific withdrawal execution without proof.
