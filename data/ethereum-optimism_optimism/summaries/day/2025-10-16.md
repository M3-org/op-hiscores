# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant consensus-breaking feature for operator fees, alongside numerous bug fixes, code refactoring, and extensive test enhancements across the Optimism monorepo.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Operator Fee Formula Update and Jovian Upgrade Preparation
A major feature was implemented to update the operator fee formula, a consensus-breaking change aimed at improving its utility. This involved extensive modifications across `op-node`, `op-e2e`, and `contracts-bedrock` to support the upcoming Jovian upgrade. ([#17366](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17366))

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure and Stability
Significant effort was put into improving the robustness and coverage of acceptance tests. This included fixing flaky tests, simplifying report generation, and adding new tests for EL Sync, reorg scenarios, and gap filling. Test organization and quality were also improved for `ReinitializableBase` and `SafeSend` contracts. ([#17891](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17891), [#17894](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17894), [#17893](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17893), [#17839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17839), [#17896](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17896))

### Core Infrastructure and Deployment Improvements
Updates were made to `op-supernode` for versioning and Docker image targets, and `op-devstack` now dynamically assigns Geth subprocess P2P listening ports to prevent test flakes. Deployment testing was also re-enabled for v3 upgrades with new fork block numbers. ([#17906](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17906), [#17904](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17904), [#17852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17852))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Scalar Fix and DA Footprint Limit Implementation
Several issues related to the Scalar Fix and DA Footprint Limit were closed. This includes the implementation of the Scalar Fix specification ([#17002](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17002)) and the addition of acceptance tests ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17278)) and unit tests ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17395)) for the DA Footprint Limit.

### Sepolia Sequencer Updates
Two issues concerning the Sepolia sequencer were closed, indicating progress in infrastructure. This includes the deployment of a new `geth-f-sequencer-3` with Flashblocks ([#17682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17682)) and the demotion/lightening of `op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1` ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17683)).

### Dispute Monitor Sync Handling
An issue regarding `op-dispute-mon`'s handling of out-of-sync nodes was closed, with discussions around using the highest L2 block or `syncStatus.CurrentL1` to determine node sync. ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814))

## NEW ISSUES

### Jovian Upgrade Related Concerns
New issues highlight potential challenges with the upcoming Jovian upgrade, specifically regarding operator fee parameter testing ([#17897](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17897)) and the marshaling of new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` before Jovian activation, which is breaking some zk stacks ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17907)).

### Sequencer Operation Issues
A new issue reports a failure to start the sequencer with an "no unsafe head" error after linking the conductor, indicating a potential operational problem. ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17899))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Jovian Operator Fee Saturating Math
The discussion on [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17888) revolves around revisiting the saturating math issue in the `operatorFee` getter for the Jovian upgrade. The latest comment suggests that a recent analysis might imply no need for any saturating math, potentially simplifying the implementation.
