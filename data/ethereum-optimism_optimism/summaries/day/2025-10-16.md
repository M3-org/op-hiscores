# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant consensus-breaking feature for operator fees, alongside critical bug fixes in testing infrastructure. There was also a strong emphasis on enhancing test coverage and organization, particularly within the `contracts-bedrock` package.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Operator Fee Formula Update
A consensus-breaking feature was implemented to update the operator fee formula, aiming for increased utility. This change involved modifications across various components including `op-node`, `op-e2e`, and `contracts-bedrock`.
- Implemented a new operator fee formula ([#17366](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17366)).

### Testing Infrastructure Improvements
Several fixes and enhancements were made to the testing suite, addressing flakiness and improving test organization and coverage.
- Fixed flaky tests in `op-acceptance-tests` and simplified report generation ([#17891](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17891)).
- Removed environment variable manipulation from `VerifyOPCM` tests to prevent issues ([#17813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17813)).
- Reorganized `ReinitializableBase` tests for better structure and naming conventions ([#17839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17839)).
- Improved `SafeSend` test coverage and quality by converting to fuzz tests and adding edge case handling ([#17896](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17896)).
- Added new acceptance tests for EL Sync triggering via FCU retries and reorg/gap filling scenarios ([#17894](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17894), [#17893](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17893)).
- Made `_TestInit` contracts abstract to optimize build times ([#17889](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17889)).
- Re-enabled and updated the v3 upgrade test in `op-deployer` ([#17852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17852)).
- Added new tests for `TestEndToEndBootstrapApplyWithUpgrade` and `UpgradeSuperchainConfig` scripts ([#17826](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17826)).

### Supernode and Devstack Enhancements
Updates were made to the `op-supernode` and `op-devstack` components, including versioning, Docker image targets, and dynamic port assignment.
- Set `op-supernode` to v0.1.0 and configured Docker Image Target ([#17906](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17906)).
- Dynamically assigned geth subprocess p2p listening port in `op-devstack` to prevent test flakes ([#17904](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17904)).
- Updated `op-supernode` README for virtual node configuration and metrics routing ([#17878](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17878)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Scalar Fixes and DA Footprint Limits
Several issues related to scalar fixes and data availability footprint limits were closed, indicating progress in these areas.
- Implemented the Scalar Fix specification ([#17002](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17002)).
- Completed acceptance tests for DA Footprint Limit ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17278)).
- Added unit tests for DA Footprint Limit in `op-geth` ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17395)).

### Sepolia Sequencer Updates
Issues concerning the deployment and configuration of Sepolia sequencers were resolved, reflecting ongoing infrastructure management.
- Deployed a new `geth-f-sequencer-3` in Sepolia with Flashblocks ([#17682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17682)).
- Demoted and lightened `op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1` in Sepolia ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17683)).

### Dispute Monitor Sync Handling
A critical bug in the `op-dispute-mon` regarding the handling of out-of-sync nodes was addressed.
- Fixed `op-dispute-mon` handling of out-of-sync nodes to use in-sync nodes as source of truth ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Jovian Operator Fee Concerns
New issues have been raised concerning the `jovian/operator-fee` implementation, specifically regarding testing and potential breaking changes.
- Request for an explicit test to verify operator fee parameter changes post-Jovian fork ([#17897](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17897)).
- Concern about marshaling new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` before Jovian is active, potentially breaking zk stacks ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17907)).

### Conductor Sequencing Failure
A new issue reports a failure in `op-conductor` to start the sequencer due to a "no unsafe head" error.
- `op-conductor` failed to start sequencer with "no unsafe head" error after linking ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17899)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Jovian Operator Fee Saturating Math
The discussion on [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17888) revolves around revisiting the saturating math issue in the `operatorFee` getter for Jovian. The latest comment suggests that a recent analysis might imply no need for any saturating math, which could simplify the implementation and avoid potential overflow reverts.
