# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant consensus-breaking feature for operator fees, alongside critical bug fixes in testing infrastructure. There was also a strong emphasis on enhancing test coverage and organization, particularly within the `contracts-bedrock` package, and improvements to `op-supernode` and `op-devstack` configurations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Operator Fee Formula Update
A consensus-breaking change was implemented to update the operator fee formula, aiming for increased utility. This involved extensive modifications across core components and the addition of new tests to validate the updated logic.
- Implemented a new operator fee formula ([#17366](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17366)).

### Testing Infrastructure Improvements
Significant effort was directed towards improving the reliability and organization of the testing suite, including fixes for flaky tests, better test organization, and expanded test coverage.
- Fixed flaky tests and simplified report generation in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17891](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17891)).
- Refactored `ReinitializableBase` test organization for better clarity and adherence to conventions ([#17839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17839)).
- Improved `SafeSend` test coverage and quality by converting to fuzz tests and adding edge case handling ([#17896](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17896)).
- Added new acceptance tests for EL Sync triggering via FCU retries and reorg/gap filling scenarios ([#17894](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17894), [#17893](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17893)).
- Made `_TestInit` contracts abstract to optimize build times ([#17889](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17889)).
- Re-enabled and updated upgrade tests in `op-deployer` ([#17852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17852)).
- Added new end-to-end bootstrap apply and SuperchainConfig upgrade tests ([#17826](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17826)).

### Supernode and Devstack Enhancements
Updates were made to the `op-supernode` for versioning and Docker image targets, and `op-devstack` was improved for dynamic port assignment to prevent test flakes.
- Set `op-supernode` to v0.1.0 and configured Docker image targets ([#17906](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17906)).
- Dynamically assigned Geth subprocess P2P listening ports in `op-devstack` to avoid conflicts ([#17904](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17904)).
- Updated `op-supernode` README for virtual node configuration and metrics routing ([#17878](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17878)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Scalar Fix and DA Footprint Limit Implementation
Several issues related to the Scalar Fix and Data Availability Footprint Limit were closed, indicating progress in implementing and testing these features.
- The implementation of the Scalar Fix specification was completed ([#17002](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17002)).
- An acceptance test for the DA Footprint Limit was written ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17278)).
- Unit tests for the DA Footprint Limit were added ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17395)).

### Sepolia Sequencer Updates
Issues concerning the deployment and configuration of Sepolia sequencers were resolved, reflecting updates to the network's infrastructure.
- A new `geth-f-sequencer-3` with Flashblocks was deployed in Sepolia ([#17682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17682)).
- The `op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1` in Sepolia was demoted and lightened ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17683)).

### Dispute Monitor Sync Handling
A critical bug in `op-dispute-mon` related to handling out-of-sync nodes was addressed, improving the reliability of dispute monitoring.
- A fix was implemented for `op-dispute-mon` to correctly handle out-of-sync nodes ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Jovian Operator Fee Concerns
New issues highlight specific testing and marshaling challenges related to the upcoming Jovian upgrade's operator fee changes.
- An explicit test is needed for setting operator fee parameters before the Jovian upgrade ([#17897](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17897)).
- There's a concern about not marshaling new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SystemConfig` until Jovian is active, as it's breaking some zk stacks ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17907)).

### Conductor and Sequencer Stability
A new issue reports a problem with `op-conductor` failing to start the sequencer due to a "no unsafe head" error.
- `op-conductor` is failing to start the sequencer with an "no unsafe head" error after linking ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17899)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Jovian Operator Fee Saturating Math
The discussion on [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17888) revolves around revisiting the saturating math issue in the `operatorFee` getter for the Jovian upgrade. The latest comment suggests that a recent analysis might imply no need for any saturating math, which could simplify the implementation. The initial concern was whether to revert on an overflow caused by `* 100` or use `saturatingMul`.
