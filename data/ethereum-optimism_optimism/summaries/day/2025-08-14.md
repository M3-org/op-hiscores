## NEW ISSUES

### Audit Process and Security Readiness
A new issue, [#17069](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17069), was opened to track the audit process for the Dispute Game Creator Pattern refactor, outlining requirements for threat modeling and an audit readiness document.

### CLI Flag Recognition for op-up
Issue [#17076](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17076) was created to address `op-up`'s inability to recognize standard CLI flags like `--help` and `--version`, leading to errors.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Event Call Graph and System Refactoring
Discussion continued on [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16874), which aims to add logic to trace event flow. On Aug 14, `sashass1315` mentioned submitting a PR for review. However, on Aug 15, `pcw109550` indicated that the team is leaning towards removing the entire event system, suggesting the proposed changes might not be merged but the code could still be useful for understanding control flow during the removal process. The issue was later closed on Aug 25 by `mslipper` as similar functionality was implemented elsewhere.

### Migration of FP Recovery Tasks
On [#1162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1162), which concerns migrating blacklist games to a new template framework and removing old FP recovery tasks, `blmalone` offered assistance with sync time or async work and PR review on Aug 14. The issue was later closed on Aug 18.
