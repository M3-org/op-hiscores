# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on CI/CD pipeline improvements, including zstd support for contract scripts and machine size bumps to prevent timeouts. Significant enhancements were made to contract test coverage, alongside updates to op-deployer and op-e2e configurations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements & Stability**
    *   Added zstd support for contracts scripts, enabling default uploads in both formats ([#18237](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18237)).
    *   Disabled parallel composite uploads for `publish-contract-artifacts` to prevent CI job timeouts, accepting a longer upload time as a trade-off ([#18236](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18236)).
    *   Increased CI machine size for `publish-contract-artifacts` to 2xlarge to resolve out-of-memory issues during contract compilation ([#18257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18257)).
    *   Migrated CI workflows away from self-hosted runners and removed code persistence optimizations related to them ([#18260](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18260), [#18259](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18259), [#18251](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18251)).
    *   Introduced blobless checkouts for some low-risk CI jobs to optimize performance ([#18249](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18249)).

*   **Contract Test Coverage & Deployment Improvements**
    *   Enhanced RLPWriter test coverage by adding tests for `writeAddress` and `writeBool` functions, and introduced fuzz testing ([#18119](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18119)).
    *   Improved Hashing library test coverage and quality by converting hardcoded tests to fuzz tests ([#18195](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18195)).
    *   Updated `op-deployer` to include `AnchorStateRegistry` and `Opcm` components in `state.json` output, which were previously set to `0x000...000` ([#18241](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18241)).
    *   Added a recommendation for a Safe fallback owner to mitigate risks when removing `TimelockGuard` in `changeOwnershipToFallback` calls ([#18239](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18239)).

*   **E2E Testing and Node Logging**
    *   Modified `op-e2e` to only deploy the fast game in `AllocTypeFastGame` and use it in withdrawal tests, making the fast game genuinely fast ([#18263](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18263)).
    *   Ensured driver start logs are captured in `op-node` for better debugging and monitoring ([#18254](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18254)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Kona Action Tests for Jovian**
    *   The issue regarding ensuring Kona has passing action tests for Jovian has been closed, with confirmation that Jovian action tests are now included in `op-e2e/actions/proofs` and run by Kona's CI ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17303)).

*   **CI `check-for-changes` Step Failure**
    *   An issue concerning the intermittent failure of the `check-for-changes` step in CI, related to a `checkout` workaround, was created and subsequently closed on the same day ([#18258](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18258)).

## NEW ISSUES

*   **CI Stability Concerns**
    *   An intermittent failure in the `check-for-changes` step in CI, linked to a `checkout` workaround, has been reported and closed on the same day ([#18258](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18258)).
    *   Acceptance tests are sporadically timing out in CI, as observed in a failing run ([#18261](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18261)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **`op-node`: Single Aggregate Safe-Head Advancement FCU Message Per Channel** ([#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15393))
    *   The discussion revolves around optimizing the frequency of FCU (Fork Choice Update) messages sent by the `op-node` to the execution layer (EL), particularly when the batcher runs with a considerable `--max-channel-duration`.
    *   **Latest Update:** A recent merge ([#18234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18234)) is expected to help address the issue.
    *   **Previous Discussion:** The problem stems from "FCU spam" where many FCU calls are made in quick succession, potentially impacting performance, especially when the EL is not local. There was a suggestion to debounce the engine-controller FCU code. The `kona-node` has already implemented a solution to send only one FCU per span batch in the happy-path.
    *   **Open Questions:** Whether FCU calls should be sent with the `no_tx_pool` flag set when they are made very close to each other.

*   **Document `cannonKonaPrestate` Requirement for Upgrades** ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18095))
    *   The issue highlights the need to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for standard chains during upgrades, even though `opcm.upgrade` doesn't strictly enforce it.
    *   **Latest Update:** The devrel team agrees on the importance of highlighting this requirement in Optimism documentation, especially for the U18 upgrade. Updates will follow once the documentation is set up.

*   **Improve Safe Guards When Updating the Batcher on the SystemConfig** ([#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18246))
    *   This issue focuses on enhancing the safeguards when updating the batcher configuration on the SystemConfig.
    *   **Latest Update:** A related issue ([#17490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17490)) was referenced, suggesting similar concerns or approaches.
