# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on CI/CD pipeline enhancements, including zstd support for contract scripts and machine size bumps, alongside significant test coverage improvements for core contracts.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD Pipeline & Artifact Management Improvements
*   Added zstd support for contract scripts, enabling default uploads in both formats ([#18237](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18237)).
*   Disabled parallel composite uploads for `publish-contract-artifacts` to prevent timeouts, accepting a 2-3x increase in upload time ([#18236](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18236)).
*   Increased CI machine size for `publish-contract-artifacts` to 2xlarge to resolve out-of-memory issues during contract compilation ([#18257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18257)).
*   Migrated away from self-hosted runners and removed related checkout optimizations and `latitude-1` box usages in CircleCI configurations ([#18260](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18260), [#18259](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18259), [#18251](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18251)).
*   Introduced blobless checkouts for simple, low-risk jobs in CircleCI ([#18249](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18249)).

### Contract Test Coverage & Security Enhancements
*   Enhanced RLPWriter test coverage by adding tests for `writeAddress` and `writeBool`, and introducing a fuzz test ([#18119](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18119)).
*   Improved Hashing library test coverage and quality by converting a hardcoded test to a fuzz test ([#18195](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18195)).
*   Recommended a Safe fallback owner to mitigate risks when removing TimelockGuard in `changeOwnershipToFallback` ([#18239](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18239)).

### Deployer and Node Updates
*   Included `AnchorStateRegistry` and `Opcm` components in the `state.json` output for `op-deployer` ([#18241](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18241)).
*   Ensured driver start logs are captured in `op-node` ([#18254](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18254)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#18264](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18264) `build(contracts)`: Enforce compiler warnings and fix test return value checks.
*   [#18263](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18263) `op-e2e`: Only deploy the fast game in `AllocTypeFastGame`.
*   [#18262](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18262) Add deny warnings to default `test_command`.
*   [#18256](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18256) `ctb`: Add contracts release checklist to `release-process.md`.
*   [#18255](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18255) Merge upstream `op-node/v1.16.1`.
*   [#18252](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18252) `docs`: Add note about L2 gas price oracle updates.
*   [#18250](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18250) `op-e2e`: Enable Osaka on L1 by default.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### CI/CD Stability and Test Coverage
*   The issue regarding Kona having passing action tests for Jovian has been resolved, with Jovian action tests now included in `op-e2e/actions/proofs` and run by Kona's CI ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17303)).
*   An intermittent CI failure in the `check-for-changes` step, related to a `checkout` workaround, was identified and closed today ([#18258](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18258)).

## NEW ISSUES
### CI/CD Reliability Concerns
*   An intermittent failure in the `check-for-changes` step in CI has been reported, potentially linked to a `checkout` workaround ([#18258](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18258)).
*   Acceptance tests are sporadically timing out, indicating potential instability in the testing environment ([#18261](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18261)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-node`: Single Aggregate Safe-Head Advancement FCU Message Per Channel ([#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15393))
The discussion continues on optimizing the frequency of `FCU` (Fork Choice Update) messages. The latest comment from `teddyknox` suggests that a recently merged PR ([#18234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18234)) might help address the issue of excessive `FCU` calls. Previous comments highlighted that `FCU` spam occurs because every pending safe update event comes with `Concluding = true`, triggering an `FCU`. It was suggested that only the last `PromoteLocalSafeEvent` in a sequence should have `Concluding = true` to reduce `FCU` calls. The impact of `FCU` processing cost, especially with non-local ELs, was also discussed, with `protolambda` suggesting a debounce mechanism for `FCU` code if API calls are prohibitively expensive.

### Document `cannonKonaPrestate` Requirement for Upgrades ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18095))
The need to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades, particularly for standard chains, is being discussed. `Inphi` confirmed that after chatting with devrel, this requirement will be highlighted in the Optimism documentation, especially for the U18 upgrade.

### Improve Safe Guards When Updating the Batcher on the SystemConfig ([#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18246))
This issue, opened yesterday, is related to improving safeguards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig. `geoknee` noted a similar or related issue ([#17490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17490)), suggesting a broader concern around batcher updates.
