# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the introduction of a new feature to enhance testing capabilities, specifically adding EL engine mocking support to `op-sync-tester`. This development directly addresses an active issue concerning the validation of L2CL by mimicking different L2EL implementations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing Capabilities
A new feature was introduced to add EL engine mocking support to `op-sync-tester` ([#17645](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17645)). This is a significant step towards validating L2CL by allowing the simulation of various L2EL implementations, particularly for initial EL sync and diverse engine API responses.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#17645](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17645), titled "feat: add EL engine mocking support to op-sync-tester" was opened. This PR introduces a new feature to enhance testing.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-sync-tester: Mock different EL implementations for initial EL Sync
Discussion on [#17632](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17632) continued with a new comment from @avorylli. They indicated that an implementation of the proposed feature (mocking different EL implementations for initial EL Sync) has been made and requested a review from @pcw109550. This suggests progress on addressing the need to validate L2CL by mimicking multiple L2EL implementations.
