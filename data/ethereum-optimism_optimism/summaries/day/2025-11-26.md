# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 26, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `op-deployer` with Forge verification capabilities and improving the `OPContractsManagerV2` by preventing `address(0)` as `SystemConfig` for upgrades. Several internal code improvements and new pull requests were also initiated.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Deployment and Verification Tools
The `op-deployer` received significant updates, backporting Forge verification scripts to streamline the deployment and verification process for contracts. This includes new verification utilities, artifact handling, and integration tests.
- Forge verification scripts backported to `op-deployer` for `op-contracts/v5.0.0` ([#18352](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18352)).
- Introduction of `WithArchive` matcher in `op-devstack` for Pectra acceptance tests ([#18227](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18227)).

### Smart Contract Robustness Improvements
Improvements were made to the `OPContractsManagerV2` to enhance its robustness and prevent erroneous configurations during upgrades.
- `OPContractsManagerV2` now reverts if `address(0)` is provided as `SystemConfig` during an upgrade ([#18376](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18376)).
- Refactored contract testing to use `vm.prank(address,bool)` for `delegateCall`, removing the `DelegateCaller` contract ([#18331](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18331)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#18391](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18391): Integrates `StandardValidator.validate()` at the end of the apply process in OPCM.
- [#18390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18390): Adds a new check for strict pragma in contracts.
- [#18389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18389): Introduces new tests for existing behaviors in OPCMv2.
- [#18388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18388): Replaces mock contracts with `vm.mock` functions in contracts.
- [#18387](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18387): Aims to identify dependencies by intentionally breaking OPCM v1.
- [#18386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18386): Introduces a new `bgpo` module in `op-service`.
- [#18385](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18385): Fixes safe head debounce in `op-node`.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### ZK Proof Generation and Challenger Strategy
Discussions around ZK proof generation and challenging mechanisms are ongoing. For [#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18319), Inphi suggests the succinct Rust challenger should generate ZK proofs due to the shift towards a Rust stack and the complexities of reimplementing SPN interactions in Go. Regarding [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18322), Inphi believes the challenger logic is straightforward enough to be reimplemented in `op-challenger`, acknowledging that the Rust challenger might be adopted long-term.

### VM-Runner ZK Execution Support
Issue [#18325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18325) focuses on enabling ZK execution in `vm-runner`. Inphi clarified that while actual ZK execution requires Rust due to SP1 dependency, `vm-runner` could be updated to drive the executor, potentially by embedding the Rust executor within a Docker image.

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency Refinement
The discussion on [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18347) revolves around removing the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry`. Inphi suggests expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface to include an `AnchorStateRegistry` method, maintaining a sanity check for using the correct ASR. ajsutton questioned the necessity of this sanity check given existing deployment-time checks but acknowledged that adding `wasRespectedAtGameCreation` has already tied dispute game implementations to the ASR.

### Universal Proofs Runbook
Issue [#18372](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18372) concerns documenting a clear process for routing to the correct runbook for the Proofs system. Inphi has produced a runbook at a Notion link, aiming to clarify which runbook to use based on on-chain information for any given proofs deployment.
