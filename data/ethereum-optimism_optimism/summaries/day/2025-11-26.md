# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in `op-deployer` with the addition of Forge verification scripts and updates to OPCMv2 for stricter system configuration. Development also focused on refining testing infrastructure and contract interactions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Deployment and Verification Tools
The `op-deployer` received a new feature to integrate Forge verification scripts, improving the deployment and verification process for contracts. This includes updates to various configuration, utility, and testing files within the `op-deployer` package. ([#18352](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18352))

### Stricter Contract Management for Upgrades
OPCMv2 was updated to prevent users from providing `address(0)` as the `SystemConfig` during upgrades, ensuring more robust and secure contract management. ([#18376](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18376))

### Testing Infrastructure Improvements
The development stack was enhanced with a new `WithArchive` matcher for acceptance tests, specifically used in Pectra feature tests. Additionally, mock contracts were replaced with `vm.prank(address,bool)` for delegateCall operations, streamlining testing procedures. ([#18227](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18227), [#18331](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18331))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### ZK Proof Generation and Challenger Strategy
Discussions around ZK proof generation and challenging strategies are ongoing. For [#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18319) (SPIKE: Investigate which service should generate ZK proofs), Inphi suggests the succinct Rust challenger should generate ZK proofs due to the move towards a Rust stack and its native interaction with SP1 libraries, making it more efficient than extending the Go-based `op-proposer`. Regarding [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18322) (SPIKE: Decide how to support challenging ZK games), Inphi believes the challenger logic is straightforward enough to be reimplemented in `op-challenger`, acknowledging that a Rust challenger might be used long-term as the Rust stack evolves.

### ZK Execution Support in vm-runner
For [#18325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18325) (vm-runner: Support ZK execution), Inphi clarified that actual ZK execution needs to be written in Rust due to its dependency on SP1. However, an option could be added to `vm-runner` or the Rust executor could be embedded in the Docker image to drive the executor, allowing verification without full ZK proof generation.

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency Refinement
The discussion on [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18347) (Remove IFaultDisputeGame dependency from AnchorStateRegistry) centers on the necessity of a sanity check that the `anchorStateRegistry()` from the dispute game matches the `AnchorStateRegistry` itself. Inphi argues this check provides an extra layer of defense against accidentally using the wrong `AnchorStateRegistry` while reporting the correct one. Ajsutton questioned the necessity of this check given deployment-time checks via `OPStandardValidator`, but later conceded that requiring the method might not be a significant issue due to `wasRespectedAtGameCreation` tying dispute game implementations to the anchor state registry. Inphi suggested expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface to require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method.
