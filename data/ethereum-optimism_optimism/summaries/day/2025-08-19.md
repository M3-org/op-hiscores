# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Aug 19, 2025)

## OVERVIEW

Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, improving performance metrics, and refining batcher throttling. Key updates include migrating operator fee tests to a new framework, fixing a safe head database test, and adding i-cache miss metrics to Cannon and op-challenger.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing Framework and Reliability

Significant progress was made in improving the testing infrastructure. Operator fee acceptance tests were migrated from the legacy `devnet-sdk` to the new `op-devstack` framework, streamlining test execution and maintenance ([#17130](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17130)). A critical bug in the `TestNotTruncateDatabaseOnRestartWithExistingDatabase` test was fixed, ensuring its independent execution and reliability ([#17127](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17127)). Additionally, the `go-tests` timeout was reduced, optimizing CI efficiency ([#17126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17126)).

### Performance Monitoring and Optimization

New metrics were introduced to enhance performance monitoring. Cannon and op-challenger now report i-cache misses, providing valuable insights into instruction pre-heap efficiency ([#17123](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17123)). The op-batcher's default throttle parameters were improved, increasing both lower and higher thresholds to widen the throttling range and prevent premature throttling ([#17148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17148)).

### Codebase Refinements

A notable refactoring effort involved the removal of `ForceResetEvent` across multiple components, simplifying the codebase and potentially improving clarity in event handling ([#17061](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17061)). The `op-program` now relies on the `mise` install cache for prestate builds, which fixes the `preimage-reproducibility` CCI workflow ([#17124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17124)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Implementation and Exposure

Several issues related to Flashblocks were closed, indicating progress in its implementation and accessibility. This includes enabling Flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16688)) and exposing the Flashblocks-websocket for RPC providers ([#16811](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16811)).

### Testing and Release Readiness

Key issues related to testing and release readiness were resolved. This includes the completion of interop transaction fuzzing ([#15166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15166)), the initial release of `op-up` ([#17003](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17003)), and the revision of `safedb` EL sync tests in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17083](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17083)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Developer Experience and Tooling

Several new issues highlight a focus on improving developer experience and standardizing tooling. This includes adding an ASCII welcome message to `op-up` ([#17134](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17134)), prompting users with a survey link on `op-up` shutdown ([#17135](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17135)), and a broader initiative to standardize development tooling and define a "chain descriptor" ([#17146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17146), [#17147](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17147)).

### Flashblocks Operational Readiness and Documentation

New issues were opened to address operational aspects and documentation for Flashblocks. This includes coordinating and reviewing public documentation drafts ([#17141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17141)), planning on-call onboarding and revision for Flashblocks ([#17142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17142)), setting up alerts for unhealthy non-Flashblocks enabled sequencers ([#17143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17143)), and conducting infrastructure threat modeling related to Flashblocks delivery ([#17144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17144)).

### Testing and Metrics Refinements

Further refinements to testing and metrics were proposed. An issue was opened to revise `op-program`'s `verify-reproducibility` workflow due to fragility with the `mise` cache ([#17156](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17156)). There's also a need to improve the `op-batcher`'s throttling intensity metric for better visibility in Grafana ([#17149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17149)), and to investigate missing logs in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17151)).
