# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jun 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on refining the `op-batcher` by removing a redundant flag, streamlining its behavior. New pull requests were opened for devnet fixes and contract updates, while discussions continued on critical issues like sync testing and CI/CD SLAs.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Batcher Simplification
The `op-batcher` component saw a significant simplification with the removal of the `preferLocalSafeL2` flag ([#16413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16413)). This change makes the previous configurable behavior the default, streamlining the batcher's operation and reflecting confidence in fixes for related `op-node` bugs.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened:
- [#16449](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16449) aims to fix second-pass templating in `kurtosis-devnet` when no docker build jobs are defined.
- [#16451](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16451) proposes an update to v400 contracts hashes and the release tag.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed on this day.

## NEW ISSUES

### Sync Testing Enhancements
A new tracking issue, [#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16452), was opened to address the need for a service (`op-sync-tester`) for mock EL sync testing. This aims to facilitate long-range sync testing of the L2 consensus layer without requiring a full, large EL deployment.

### Acceptance Test Expansion
Two new issues were created to expand acceptance tests:
- [#16434](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16434) proposes adding a test to maximize the number of executing messages across two chains simultaneously.
- [#16435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16435) suggests adding a load test with invalid executing messages to assess their impact on valid message latency.

### CI/CD SLA Exploration
Issue [#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16437) was opened to spike the idea of adopting internal SLAs for the continuous integration pipeline, aiming to improve CI health and developer experience.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Configurable Dependency Set
Discussion continued on [#361](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/361), which seeks to allow configurable dependency sets for L2 chains in supersim. The latest comments suggest a flag like `--dependency-set <chains>` to specify which chains belong to a dependency set, with a reference to the Optimism dependency set specification for guidance. The goal is to enable testing applications both within and outside a dependency set.

### CI SLAs
On [#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16437), the discussion revolved around the proposed CI pipeline SLAs and accountability framework. Key points included:
- **Developer Perspective**: Some developers expressed skepticism about the direct impact of SLAs on their daily work, noting that issues would still be complained about regardless of SLA adherence.
- **Specific Metrics**: Concerns were raised about the proposed 5% expected failure rate being too high and the 1-hour PR feedback time being too long for pre-merge checks.
- **Flaky Tests**: There was a strong consensus that flaky tests are a major issue, with suggestions to either rapidly fix them or implement smarter mechanisms to prevent them from entering the repo (e.g., running new tests many times in parallel before admittance).
- **Disabling Checks**: The idea of disabling checks that are breaking was largely opposed, with a preference for reverting the PR that introduced the breakage.
- **PR Merge Time**: This metric was questioned as a CI SLA, being more dependent on reviewer availability and discussion than CI infrastructure.
- **Accountability**: The proposed accountability framework for bad test resolution and responsibility matrix for flaky test logic, infrastructure, and external dependencies were presented for feedback.
