# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, particularly for sync and cross-domain messaging, alongside critical updates to the OP Contracts Manager and TimelockGuard for improved security and functionality.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing and Sync Logic
Significant progress was made in bolstering the testing framework, including a new acceptance test to verify unsafe chain stalling when `ReqResSync` is disabled [#17696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17696). Additionally, comments related to unsafe payload queue syncing logic in `op-acceptance-tests` were corrected to accurately reflect the system's behavior [#17712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17712). A bug fix was also implemented to exclude Foundry VM addresses from L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger fuzz tests, preventing intermittent failures [#17709](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17709).

### OP Contracts Manager and TimelockGuard Updates
The OP Contracts Manager now supports Cannon and Kona games in `updatePrestates` through a new struct, allowing for incremental updates [#17512](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17512). A full implementation of the `TimelockGuard` was completed, featuring external signature validation for `cancelTransaction` and `configureTimelockGuard`, and a single struct per Safe [#17584](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17584).

### Beacon Client and Deployer Optimizations
The `op-deployer`'s default `GasPadFactor` was reduced from 2.0 to 1.2 to ensure `opcm.deploy` transactions remain under the 16.77Mgas limit imposed by EIP-7825 [#17710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17710). Furthermore, the `op-service/L1BeaconClient` now allows blob proof verification to be skipped via a new `l1.beacon.skip-blob-verification` flag, which has also been added to `op-program` and `op-challenger` [#17713](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17713), [#17718](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17718).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#17717](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17717): This pull request aims to correct a `console.log` format string within the `ManageDrippie` script.
- [#17720](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17720): This pull request proposes a refactor to improve the test coverage and quality of `ProtocolVersions` tests.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fusaka Activation Test
The issue regarding the need for a Fusaka activation test, similar to the L1 Prague fork test, has been closed [#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17500). This was addressed via PR #17666.

### Validation Chain Config Negative Testing
The long-standing issue concerning the addition of chain config negative testing for validation code has been closed [#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/686). The decision was made to close it as it is no longer relevant, given the shift to a report-based approach instead of a validation-based one.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon: Support go1.25 [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17060)
Discussion continues regarding the compatibility of Cannon with Go 1.25. @sebastianst inquired if Optimism is affected, to which @pauldowman confirmed that it does affect them, with @ajsutton providing more context. @ajsutton further elaborated that all keccak hashes are incorrect when running in Cannon with Go 1.25, impacting block hash calculations. A Notion document detailing the diagnosis was linked, pointing to a specific Go issue as the underlying problem.

### validation: add chain config negative testing [#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/686)
This issue was closed today. @alfonso-op confirmed with @bitwiseguy that the issue is no longer relevant due to a shift from a validation-based approach to a report-based one.
