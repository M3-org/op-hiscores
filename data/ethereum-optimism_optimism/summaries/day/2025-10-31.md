# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 31, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing test coverage for core contracts, improving the stability of acceptance tests, and updating deployment tools to support new fault dispute game contracts and features. Several long-standing issues related to CI stability and Superchain Registry configuration were also closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Contract Test Coverage
Significant progress was made in bolstering the test suite for critical smart contracts. New tests were added to improve coverage and organization for the `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract, including previously untested functions like `version()` and `receive()` ([#18028](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18028)). Similarly, the `OperatorFeeVault` test file was enhanced to improve coverage and align with repository conventions, including a new `OperatorFeeVault_Version_Test` ([#18087](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18087)).

### Improved Acceptance Test Stability
Efforts were made to increase the stability of acceptance tests, particularly for DA footprint tests running on real networks. This included skipping initial scalar tests if a non-zero scalar is already set and fixing the `WaitForBlockNum` helper ([#18098](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18098)). The `op-acceptor` was also updated to v3.6.1 ([#18086](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18086)).

### Deployment Tooling Updates
The `op-deployer` tool received updates to support working with V2 fault dispute game contracts, including deploying implementations and handling dispute game configurations ([#18024](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18024)). Additionally, `opcm` was updated to support `CANNON_KONA` for upgrades, enhancing its capabilities for managing contract migrations and features ([#18059](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18059)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Registry and Tooling Improvements
Several issues related to the Superchain Registry and associated tooling were closed. This includes addressing the need to add chain names to `addresses.json` ([#999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/999)), updating the `add-chain` script to handle input variations ([#220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/220)), improving SuperchainRegistry diff tools ([#284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/284)), and checking in config parameters for each chain ([#294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/294)). Flaky CI issues related to `add-chain` ([#477](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/477)) and `golang-validate-all` ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/644)) were also resolved.

### Contract Configuration and Deployment
Issues concerning contract configuration and deployment were closed. This includes adding `L2ProxyAdminOwner` to TOML files ([#470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/470)), supporting Holesky testnets ([#518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/518)), and adding contract implementation addresses to superchain config ([#520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/520)). An issue regarding the overhaul of fault proof contract address storage and discovery ([#604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/604)) was also closed.

### CI and Documentation Cleanup
Various CI and documentation-related issues were closed. This includes making acceptance tests blocking ([#16270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16270)), adding verification guides to OP docs ([#17145](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17145)), standardizing development tooling ([#17146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17146)), and initial ideation for devtools ([#17147](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17147)). An issue to move L1 RPC URL from superchain init to validation ([#609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/609)) was also closed.

### Miscellaneous Fixes and Updates
Other closed issues include updating the `upgrade` method ([#17742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17742)), tuning the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy-upstream-messages-low` alert for Sepolia ([#17716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17716)), and improving `op-deployer` logs and Etherscan verification on Sepolia ([#18089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18089)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Deployment and Logging Improvements
- **Increased Log Verbosity for Deployed Contracts**: A new issue highlights the need for more explicit logs when contracts are already deployed at the same address, rather than silently skipping them ([#18099](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18099)).

### Blob Transaction Priority Fee Tracking
- **Blob Priority Fee Tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr`**: A new issue proposes implementing blob priority fee tracking within `op-batcher/txmgr`, noting that blob transactions have effectively separate priority fees compared to regular transactions ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18102)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Reporting and Parallelization
- **Report Unused Acceptance Tests**: @janjakubnanista questioned if reporting unused acceptance tests is still desired, following up on @alfonso-op's earlier suggestion for a "staging" gate for tests ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16273)).
- **Parallelize "memory-all" job**: @janjakubnanista inquired if parallelizing the "memory-all" job is still a priority, given that the PR addressing it was auto-closed ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17525)).

### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerts
- **Alert for Non-Flashblocks-Enabled Sequencer**: @zhwrd asked if this ticket is still relevant or if there's an existing way to detect if Flashblocks is disabled, following up on @jelias2's comment about creating an alert after a specific PR lands ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16867)).

### Superchain Registry Refactor and Configuration
- **Investigate L2 Key Handover Test**: @janjakubnanista asked @bitwiseguy if this issue is still relevant after the recent refactor ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/643)).
- **Encode ProxyAdminOwner Exceptions**: @janjakubnanista questioned @bitwiseguy if this issue has been addressed with SCR 2.0, following @alfonso-op's comment that it was blocked on Unichain launch and @bitwiseguy's earlier questions about specific addresses and scope ([#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/675)).

### Proxyd Backwards Time Travel
- **Proxyd: backwards time travel is possible when backends are not in sync**: @alfonso-op linked this issue to a related one ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/501)).
