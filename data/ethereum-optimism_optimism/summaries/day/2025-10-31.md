# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 31, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing test coverage for core contracts, improving the stability of acceptance tests, and updating deployment tools to support new fault dispute game contracts and features. Several long-standing issues related to testing, tooling, and Superchain Registry configurations were also closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Test Coverage and Stability
Significant efforts were made to improve the robustness of the Optimism ecosystem through expanded test coverage and increased stability. This included adding comprehensive tests for `L2ToL1MessagePasser` and `OperatorFeeVault` contracts, ensuring critical functionalities are thoroughly validated [#18028](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18028), [#18087](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18087). Additionally, stability improvements were implemented for DA footprint acceptance tests, particularly when running on real networks, by optimizing scalar tests and block number helpers [#18098](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18098).

### Deployment Tooling Updates
The `op-deployer` tool received updates to support V2 fault dispute game contracts, streamlining the deployment process for new game configurations. This involved updating deployment scripts and integration tests to accommodate the new contract versions [#18024](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18024). Furthermore, `opcm` was updated to support `CANNON_KONA` features during upgrades, enhancing the flexibility and capabilities of the deployment and management tools [#18059](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18059).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Registry and Configuration Improvements
Several issues related to the Superchain Registry and chain configurations were closed, indicating progress in standardizing and refining how chain parameters are managed. This includes addressing the need to add chain names to `addresses.json` [#999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/999), improving the `add-chain` script to handle input variations [#220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/220), enhancing diff tools for the Superchain Registry [#284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/284), and checking in config parameters for each chain [#294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/294). Additionally, issues concerning the `L2ProxyAdminOwner` in TOML files [#470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/470) and the overhaul of fault proof contract address storage [#604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/604) were resolved.

### Test Workflow and Tooling Refinements
Improvements to testing workflows and development tooling were completed. This involved making the `acceptance-test` workflow blocking [#16270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16270), addressing flakey nil pointer dereferences during `add-chain` tests [#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/635), and updating the `golang-validate-all` job to provide better summaries [#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/644).

### Documentation and Feature Support
Documentation and feature support issues were also closed. This includes adding verification guides to OP docs for `op-deployer` [#17145](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17145), standardizing development tooling [#17146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17146), and supporting Holesky testnets [#518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/518).

### Miscellaneous Closures
Other closed issues include updating the `upgrade` method [#17742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17742), tuning `flashblocks-websocket-proxy-upstream-messages-low` alerts [#17716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17716), and improving `op-deployer` logs and Etherscan verification on Sepolia [#18089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18089).

## NEW ISSUES

### Logging and Debugging Enhancements
New issues highlight the need for more explicit logging and improved debugging capabilities. This includes increasing log verbosity for pre-computed contracts that are already deployed, to provide clearer output instead of silent skips [#18099](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18099).

### Blob Transaction Priority Fee Tracking
A new issue addresses the tracking of blob priority fees within `op-batcher/txmgr`. The challenge lies in the fact that blob transactions have a separate priority fee mechanism compared to regular transactions, which are typically retrieved via `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` RPC calls [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18102).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Unused Acceptance Tests
Discussion continues on whether to report unused acceptance tests [#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16273). @janjakubnanista questioned if this is still a desired feature, while @alfonso-op previously suggested a "staging" gate for tests to run without blocking merges, allowing for eventual promotion to blocking checks.

### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerts
The relevance of alerting when a non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off is being discussed [#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16867). @zhwrd asked if the ticket is still relevant or if a detection mechanism for disabled flashblocks already exists. @jelias2 previously noted that an alert would be created after a specific PR lands.

### Parallelizing Acceptance Tests
The parallelization of the "memory-all" job in `op-acceptance-tests` is under consideration to prevent increased CI duration once the workflow becomes blocking [#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17525). @janjakubnanista inquired if this is still a priority, given that a related PR was auto-closed.

### `proxyd` Time Travel Issue
A new issue has been identified where `proxyd` can "travel back in time" by returning previous blocks as the `unsafe` block if backends are out of sync [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/501). This can be semi-reliably reproduced by querying the unsafe block and then sending an `eth_call` against it. @alfonso-op linked this to a related issue with more details [#17688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17688).

### L2 Key Handover Test Investigation
An investigation into the L2 key handover test is ongoing [#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/643). @janjakubnanista asked @bitwiseguy if this issue remains relevant after recent refactoring efforts.

### ProxyAdminOwner Exceptions for Base and Unichain
The encoding of `ProxyAdminOwner` exceptions for Base and Unichain is being discussed [#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/675). @janjakubnanista believes this has been addressed with SCR 2.0 and asked @bitwiseguy for confirmation. Previously, @alfonso-op noted it was blocked on Unichain launch, and @bitwiseguy had questions regarding the standard address, mainnet/sepolia applicability, and whether to enshrine the 3/3 address in TOML files.
