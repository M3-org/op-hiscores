# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing deployment processes, improving CI/CD security, and expanding testing for core contracts. Key updates include a new `op-deployer` build for artifact publishing and critical CI permission reductions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Deployment and Artifact Management
Improvements were made to the deployment process, specifically integrating `op-deployer`'s build and compress commands for publishing artifacts, ensuring consistency and enabling uploaded artifacts. Additionally, the `FeesDepositor` address and minimum withdrawal amount were updated in genesis configurations.
- [#18488](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18488)
- [#18490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18490)

### CI/CD Security and Workflow Refinements
The CI/CD pipeline saw significant security enhancements with reduced permissions for fork builds and fixes for tag releases. Docker CI workflows were split to handle release tag pushes and branch/PR distinctions more securely.
- [#18501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18501)

### Expanded Testing and Health Monitoring
New tests were added for `OPContractsManagerV2.deploy` to improve contract reliability. Furthermore, `op-conductor` now includes first-class support for Kona health checks, alongside existing rollup-boost health checks, to ensure robust monitoring.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Deployment Configuration Updates
The issue regarding setting the `FeesDepositor` address on the deployer upon deployment has been resolved. This involved hardcoding the L1 `FeesDepositor` address in `op-deployer/pkg/deployer/standard/standard.go` and updating it in the superchain-ops repository.
- [#17505](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17505)

### Acceptance Test Environment Fix
A bug in the `op-acceptance-test` related to environment settings in the `sysgo` module and mismatched L1 genesis hash in the L2 rollup configuration was identified and promptly closed.
- [#18511](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18511)

### Documentation Theme Fix
The long-standing issue concerning the theme-switcher button text visibility in light mode on the Optimism docs site has been closed, with the resolution attributed to a framework switch.
- [#1752](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1752)

## NEW ISSUES

### Synchronization and Test Failures
New issues highlight problems with `op-node` synchronization after upgrading to v1.16.3, affecting Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments. Additionally, a bug in `op-acceptance-test` related to `sysgo` module environment settings and mismatched L1 genesis hash in L2 rollup config was reported and quickly closed.
- [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18510)
- [#18511](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18511)

### Dispute Game and Withdrawal Proof Enhancements
Several issues were opened to enhance the dispute game and withdrawal proof mechanisms. These include implementing `rootClaim(uint256 l2ChainID)` in `SuperFaultDisputeGame.sol`, adding this method to `IDisputeGame`, and ensuring `OptimismPortal2.proveWithdrawalTransaction` uses this interface for verification.
- [#18518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18518)
- [#18516](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18516)
- [#18517](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18517)

### Supernode API Integration and Transaction Submission
New issues focus on integrating supernode APIs into `dispute-mon` and `challenger` to replace supervisor API usage. There's also a proposal to support `eth_sendRawTransactionSync` in `proxyd` to reduce transaction submission latency.

- [#18524](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18524)
- [#18522](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18522)

### Flashblocks and Proposer Improvements
An issue was opened to ensure `op-acceptance-tests/flashblocks` covers block hash divergence in `op-rbuilder` to prevent incidents like the Jovian hardfork. Another issue proposes that the proposer should provide the super root preimage when creating `SuperFaultDisputeGame`s.
- [#18515](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18515)
- [#18521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18521)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-acceptance-tests: sysgo to support flashblocks / rbuilders
@geoknee inquired if the task is complete, following up on @teddyknox's previous comment about validating the `kona-node + rollup-boost` change. The current status is pending confirmation.
- [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16450)

### create a new op-spammer component for deployment in devnets
@geoknee suggested that existing prior art, specifically https://github.com/flashbots/contender, might fulfill the requirements for a simple service to periodically send user transactions to catch devnet bugs.
