# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing deployment processes, improving CI/CD security, and expanding testing for core contracts. Key updates include a new `op-deployer` build for artifact publishing and refined CI permissions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Deployment and Artifact Management
Improvements were made to the deployment process, specifically by integrating `op-deployer`'s build and compress commands for artifact publishing, ensuring consistency and enabling uploaded artifacts. Additionally, the `FeesDepositor` address and minimum withdrawal amount were updated in genesis configurations.
- feat(op-deployer): use op-deployer build for publish-artifacts ([#18488](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18488))
- chore: update fees depositor address and min withdrawal amount on genesis ([#18490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18490))

### CI/CD Security and Testing Improvements
The CI workflows were refined to reduce permissions for fork builds and fix tag releases, separating release tag pushes from branch and PR builds for enhanced security. New tests were also added for `OPContractsManagerV2.deploy`.
- ci: reduce permissions of fork builds & fix tag releases ([#18501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18501))
- test: add tests for OPCMv2.deploy ([#18486](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18486))

### Conductor Healthcheck Expansion
The `op-conductor` now includes first-class support for Kona health probes, alongside the existing rollup-boost healthcheck, addressing the need for a dedicated health endpoint for Kona.
- Add kona-healthcheck support to conductor ([#18453](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18453))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Deployment Configuration Updates
The issue regarding setting the `FeesDepositor` address on the deployer upon deployment has been resolved, with the address now updated in `op-deployer` and the superchain-ops repo.
- Set `FeesDepositor` address on deployer upon deployment ([#17505](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17505))

### Acceptance Test Environment Fix
A bug in `op-acceptance-test` related to environment settings in the sysgo module and mismatched L1 genesis hash in the L2 rollup config has been identified and closed.
- op-acceptance-test: env setting in sysgo mod, mismatched L1 genesis hash in L2 rollup config ([#18511](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18511))

## NEW ISSUES

### Dispute Game and Withdrawal Proof Enhancements
Several new issues focus on improving the dispute game mechanism and withdrawal proofs, including implementing `rootClaim(uint256 l2ChainID)` in `SuperFaultDisputeGame.sol`, extending the `IDisputeGame` interface, and ensuring `OptimismPortal2.proveWithdrawalTransaction` uses chain-specific root claims.
- contracts: Implement rootClaim(uint256 l2ChainID) in SuperFaultDisputeGame.sol ([#18518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18518))
- contracts: Add rootClaim(uint256 l2ChainId) to IDisputeGame ([#18516](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18516))
- contracts: Prove withdrawals using chain-specific root claim ([#18517](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18517))
- proposer: Propose super roots with its preimage ([#18521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18521))

### Infrastructure and Tooling Updates
New issues address critical infrastructure and tooling needs, such as updating `op-node` to v1.16.3 due to synchronization problems, adding coverage for block hash divergence in `op-rbuilder`, supporting `eth_sendRawTransactionSync` in `proxyd`, and migrating `dispute-mon` and `challenger` to supernode APIs.
- Update op-node v1.16.3. EL node can’t synchronize ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18510))
- op-acceptance-tests/flashblocks: ensure we have coverage for a block hash divergence in op-rbuilder ([#18515](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18515))
- proxyd: support `eth_sendRawTransactionSync` ([#18522](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18522))
- dispute-mon: Migrate to supernode APIs ([#18523](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18523))
- challenger: Introduce supernode provider ([#18524](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18524))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-acceptance-tests`: Sysgo Flashblocks/Rbuilders Support
The discussion on [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16450) revolves around enabling sysgo to support flashblocks and rbuilders, which is currently not possible. The latest comment from @geoknee asks for an update on whether this task is completed, following @teddyknox's earlier statement that it would be done to validate kona-node + rollup-boost changes.

### `op-spammer` Component for Devnets
Issue [#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18482) discusses creating a new `op-spammer` component for devnet deployments to periodically send user transactions and catch bugs. The latest comment from @scharissis points to `flashbots/contender` as prior art, specifically mentioning an issue within that project. @geoknee also suggested `flashbots/contender` as a potential reference.

### Docs Theme-Switcher Button Visibility
Issue [#1752](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1752) concerning the theme-switcher button text visibility in light mode on the Optimism docs site has been closed. The latest comment from @sbvegan indicates that the framework switch should resolve this issue.
