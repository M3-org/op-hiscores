# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, particularly for Jovian tests against Pectra and BPO2, alongside critical bug fixes in acceptance tests and refactoring of AI engineering prompts.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
Significant work was done to expand the `op-acceptance-tests` suite. Jovian tests are now configured to run against Pectra and BPO2, broadening test coverage for different L1 configurations [#18005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18005). A bug fix was also implemented to guard against empty tests in CI, preventing pipeline failures [#18238](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18238).

### AI Engineering Prompt Refinement
The AI engineering prompt for contract test maintenance was refactored to remove unnecessary test reordering instructions. This change aims to reduce diff sizes and improve PR reviewability without impacting functional value [#18248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18248).

### Core System Stability and Tooling
Improvements were made to the `op-node` to debounce FCU updates, enhancing system stability [#18234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18234). A general-purpose GitHub release binary downloader was introduced in `op-service`, providing a reusable tool for downloading dependencies like `forge` [#18245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18245). Additionally, `op-devstack` now includes error handling for malformed multiaddr responses, improving P2P connection reliability [#18240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18240).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Core Infrastructure Updates**: A PR to update Go to version 1.25.4 has been opened [#18247](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18247).
- **Contract and Deployment Enhancements**: New PRs address contract changes required for OPCMv2 [#18244](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18244) and the inclusion of AnchorStateRegistry + Opcm components in `state.json` for `op-deployer` [#18241](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18241).
- **Bug Fixes and Documentation**: A fix for `op-up` to cancel RPC calls upon HTTP client disconnection is proposed [#18243](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18243). Documentation for a contract release checklist requirement has been added [#18242](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18242).
- **Security Recommendation**: A PR recommending a Safe fallback owner has been opened [#18239](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18239).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Expanded Test Matrix for Jovian Tests
The issue concerning the expansion of `op-acceptance-tests` to matrix Jovian tests across Pectra and Fusaka L1s has been closed [#17980](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17980). This indicates successful implementation of testing Jovian against different L1 configurations.

## NEW ISSUES

### System Configuration Safeguards
A new issue has been opened to improve safeguards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig [#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18246). This highlights a need for enhanced protection mechanisms during critical system updates.
