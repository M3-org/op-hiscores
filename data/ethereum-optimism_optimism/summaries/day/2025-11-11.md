# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 11, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, particularly for Jovian tests across different L1 configurations, alongside general code improvements and bug fixes.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
Significant work was done to expand the `op-acceptance-tests` suite. This includes running Jovian tests against Pectra and BPO2 configurations, broadening test coverage for different L1 environments [#18005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18005). A bug fix was also implemented to guard against empty tests in CI, preventing failures [#18238](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18238).

### Code Refinements and Utilities
A refactoring effort removed unnecessary test reordering in the AI engineering prompt, simplifying diffs and review processes [#18248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18248). Additionally, a general-purpose GitHub release binary downloader was introduced, improving utility for fetching tools like `forge` [#18245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18245).

### System Stability and Error Handling
Improvements were made to system stability, including debouncing FCU updates in the `op-node` to optimize performance [#18234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18234). Error handling in `op-devstack` was also enhanced to correctly manage malformed multiaddr responses, ensuring more robust peer information retrieval [#18240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18240).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#18247](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18247) chore: Update go to 1.25.4: This PR proposes an update to the Go language version.
- [#18244](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18244) feat: contracts changes required for OPCMv2: This PR introduces contract changes necessary for OPCMv2.
- [#18243](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18243) fix(op-up): cancel RPC calls when HTTP client disconnects: This PR aims to fix RPC call cancellations upon HTTP client disconnections.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Expanded Test Matrix for Jovian Tests
The issue concerning the expansion of Jovian tests to cover Pectra and Fusaka L1s has been closed [#17980](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17980). This indicates successful implementation of a broader test matrix for the Jovian test suite.

## NEW ISSUES

### System Configuration Safeguards
A new issue has been opened to improve safeguards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig [#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18246). This aims to enhance the robustness of batcher updates.
