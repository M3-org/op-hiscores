# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `op-deployer` with feature flag migrations and artifact recompilation fixes, improving `op-acceptance-tests` stability, and refining `contracts-bedrock` with SaferSafes version checks and L1FeeVault test coverage. Significant progress was also made on Jovian DA footprint testing and dispute game related deployments.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-deployer` Enhancements and Dispute Game Integration
The `op-deployer` received significant updates, including migrating `DeployImplementations` script tests to use feature flags for better control and modularity ([#17985](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17985)). A critical bug fix was implemented to prevent embedded artifacts from recompiling unnecessarily, improving build efficiency ([#17699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17699)). Furthermore, new integration tests were added to cover the upgrade flow for the `DEPLOY_V2_DISPUTE_GAME` feature ([#17991](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17991)), and the deployment logic was refined to avoid deploying V1 dispute game blueprints when V2 is enabled ([#17973](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17973)).

### `op-acceptance-tests` and `op-node` Stability & Feature Testing
Efforts were made to improve the stability of `op-acceptance-tests` by fixing a flakey job URL issue ([#17993](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17993)) and isolating anvil environments for `TestCLIBootstrap` subtests to prevent flakiness ([#18006](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18006)). A new Jovian DA footprint test was added to `op-e2e/actions` ([#17947](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17947)), and the `op-node/rollup` was updated to drop non-empty batches for the Jovian activation block, aligning with new fork specifications ([#17984](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17984)).

### `contracts-bedrock` Refinements and Security
The `contracts-bedrock` package saw several important updates. Version checks in SaferSafes were fixed ([#18004](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18004)), and state changes were moved to `checkTransaction` in SaferSafes to improve the CEI pattern ([#17995](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17995)). Test coverage and quality for `L1FeeVault` were enhanced ([#17934](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17934)), and `OPContractsManagerStandardValidator` tests were re-enabled and updated to validate the proposer ([#17955](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17955)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dispute Game V2 Implementation and Testing
Several issues related to the deployment and testing of Dispute Game V2 were closed. This includes the resolution of [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15789) concerning Fault Proof creator contract OPCM changes, [#17256](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17256) which involved deploying new FDG and PDG implementations in `op-deployer`, and [#17773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17773) which added acceptance tests for upgrading FDG v2 implementations with `op-deployer`.

### `OPContractsManagerStandardValidator` Updates
Issues related to the `OPContractsManagerStandardValidator` were addressed, specifically [#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17267) which focused on updating the validator to handle new dispute game contracts, and [#17933](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17933) which aimed for forwards-compatible `gameType` retrieval in OPCM.

### Jovian Fork and DA Footprint Limit
Progress on the Jovian fork led to the closure of [#17704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17704), ensuring that the Jovian activation block only contains deposit transactions. Additionally, issues related to the DA Footprint Limit, specifically [#17945](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17945) for adding action proof tests and [#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17946) investigating a 0 gas scalar after genesis, were resolved.

### Deployment Logic Refinement
The issue [#17599](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17599), which aimed to ensure `DeployImplementation.s.sol` checks the bitmap input and only deploys either v1 blueprints or v2 implementations, was closed.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flaky Test: `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch`
The issue [#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17966) regarding a flaky test `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` remains active. The latest comment from @geoknee on 2025-10-23T11:48:03Z indicates that the issue cannot be reproduced locally and requests links to failures for further investigation. This suggests that the team is actively trying to diagnose the root cause of the intermittent test failures.
