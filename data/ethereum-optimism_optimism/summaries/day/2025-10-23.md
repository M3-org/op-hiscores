# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `op-deployer` with feature flag migrations and artifact recompilation fixes, alongside significant testing improvements for `OPContractsManagerStandardValidator` and Jovian DA footprint. Several critical bug fixes were also implemented for `op-acceptance-tests` and `SaferSafes`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Deployment and Artifact Management
Improvements were made to the `op-deployer` to streamline deployment processes. This included migrating `DeployImplementations` script tests to consistently use feature flags ([#17985](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17985)) and fixing an issue that caused embedded artifacts to recompile unnecessarily, speeding up development workflows ([#17699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17699)). Additionally, the deployment of V1 dispute game blueprints is now skipped when V2 is enabled, ensuring a cleaner and more efficient deployment process ([#17973](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17973)).

### Robust Testing and Validation for Core Contracts
Significant efforts were directed towards strengthening the testing framework. Tests for the `OPContractsManagerStandardValidator` were re-enabled and updated to validate the proposer for V2 contracts ([#17955](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17955)). New integration tests were added for the `op-deployer` to cover the upgrade flow for the `DEPLOY_V2_DISPUTE_GAME` feature ([#17991](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17991)). The `L1FeeVault` test coverage and quality were also improved ([#17934](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17934)).

### Jovian Fork Preparations and Bug Fixes
Preparations for the Jovian fork continued with the addition of a DA footprint test ([#17947](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17947)) and a critical update to drop non-empty batches for the Jovian activation block, aligning with new specifications ([#17984](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17984)). Bug fixes included addressing incorrect URL appending in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17993](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17993)) and resolving version check issues in `SaferSafes` ([#18004](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18004)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dispute Game Contract Updates
The `OPContractsManagerStandardValidator` has been updated to handle new dispute game contracts, resolving an issue where it pulled data from V1 implementations that are no longer accessible in V2 ([#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17267)). Additionally, the `DeployImplementations.s.sol` script was updated to deploy either V1 blueprints or V2 implementations based on feature flags, preventing the deployment of both ([#17599](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17599)).

### Jovian Fork Activation Rules
The Jovian activation block now strictly enforces that it must only contain deposit transactions, mirroring the Interop fork rules. This change aligns with recent specification updates ([#17704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17704)).

### Enhanced Testing for Dispute Game Upgrades
Acceptance tests have been added to verify that the `op-deployer` upgrade command functions correctly with and without the V2 flag enabled for FDG V2 implementations ([#17773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17773)).

### DA Footprint Limit and Gas Scalar Fixes
Issues related to the DA Footprint Limit were addressed, including the addition of action proof tests ([#17945](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17945)). A bug where the block right after genesis still had a 0 gas scalar was investigated and fixed, ensuring the correct default scalar is applied ([#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17946)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flaky Test: TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch
The test `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17966)) has been flagged as flaky. The latest comment indicates that the issue is still being investigated, with a request for links to specific failures to aid in reproduction and debugging.
