# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the `op-dispute-mon` to improve its handling of output root discrepancies and node synchronization, with a key change distinguishing 404 errors from actual "output root not found" scenarios.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Dispute Monitor Robustness
The `op-dispute-mon` received an important update to differentiate between a transport-level 404 error and an actual "output root not found" condition, which is crucial for multi-node support. This change improves the accuracy of output agreement enrichment. ([#17819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17819))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A pull request was opened to remove a redundant p2p private key path from the quickstart guide, streamlining the setup process. ([#17829](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17829))
- Another pull request proposes to consider a node invalid in `op-dispute-mon` if it has not processed L1 past the game head, aiming to improve the reliability of dispute monitoring. ([#17831](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17831))

### Addressing Out-of-Sync Node Handling in `op-dispute-mon`
Discussions on [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814) continue to focus on how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes when configured with multiple rollup RPCs. The core challenge is to ensure the monitor uses the in-sync node as the source of truth rather than incorrectly flagging disagreements. A recent comment suggests that relying solely on the highest L2 block might be misleading, as it could originate from an incorrect fork. Instead, the `CurrentL1` from the sync status should be used to determine if a node has processed the relevant L1 block for the dispute game, indicating sufficient synchronization. An earlier comment noted that [#17819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17819) will partially mitigate the problem by reducing "output root not found" errors. A general solution proposed involves using `syncStatus` to identify the highest unsafe block across all nodes as the expected current L2 head, ignoring results from nodes that are behind if the requested L2 block is not a future proposal.
