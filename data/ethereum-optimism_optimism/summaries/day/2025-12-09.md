# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the OP Stack with new features like revenue sharing audit reports and improved `op-deployer` testing. Critical bug fixes addressed fuzzing failures and CI support for external PRs. Several issues were closed, including a critical `op-node` synchronization problem.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Protocol Enhancements & Security Audits
Significant updates were made to the core protocol, including the addition of a revenue sharing audit report to bolster transparency and security ([#18103](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18103)). The `SystemConfig` was also updated to store a reference to the last used `OPContractsManager` ([#18547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18547)), improving contract management.

### Developer Tooling & Deployment Improvements
The `op-deployer` test script now supports Docker and GitHub binaries, streamlining release testing ([#18551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18551)). A new contract check runner tool was introduced to enhance code quality and security within the contracts repository ([#18553](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18553)).

### Critical Bug Fixes & CI/CD Reliability
A fuzzing failure in the `SystemConfig` test was resolved ([#18550](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18550)), improving test suite robustness. Additionally, a fix was implemented to ensure external pull requests can properly utilize the `force-use-fresh-artifacts` label in CI, enhancing workflow for external contributors ([#18557](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18557)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Critical `op-node` Synchronization and Batcher Stability
A critical issue where `op-node` v1.16.3 failed to synchronize was resolved by upgrading and resyncing `op-geth` ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18510)). The `op-batcher` was also updated to ensure a full shutdown on critical throttling RPC errors, preventing partial failures and enabling automatic recovery ([#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17768)).

### Documentation and Infrastructure Improvements
The issue regarding the lack of log retention on CloudFlare was addressed, enabling better investigation of networking and security issues ([#17859](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17859)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Critical Contract Fuzzing Failure
A new critical issue was reported concerning a fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when `_7702Target` is set to `address(0)` ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18554)). This indicates a potential incorrect behavior when handling deposits involving the zero address and its impact on aliasing.

### CI/CD Workflow Optimization
An issue was opened to remove the "Sign" step from the Docker publishing workflow in CircleCI, as it is no longer necessary ([#18558](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18558)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Documentation Updates for Node Operators
The issue concerning the update of the JSON-RPC API documentation ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1773)) was closed today, with the latest comment confirming it has been fixed. Similarly, the issue regarding the unavailability of ENV variables in documentation ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1874)) was also closed, with the latest comment from `sbvegan` confirming the fix.
