# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the OP Stack with new features, including revenue sharing audit reports and improved `op-deployer` testing. Critical bug fixes addressed fuzzing failures and CI support for external PRs. Several issues were closed, improving stability and documentation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Protocol Enhancements & Security Audits
Significant updates were made to the core protocol, including the addition of Spearbit's audit report for the revenue sharing feature, enhancing transparency and security. The `SystemConfig` was updated to reference the last used `OPContractsManager`, improving contract management. A new contract check runner tool was also introduced to bolster contract integrity.

- [#18547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18547)
- [#18553](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18553)

### Developer Tooling and CI/CD Improvements
The `op-deployer` test script now supports Docker and GitHub binaries, streamlining release testing. A critical fix was implemented to ensure external pull requests can utilize the `force-use-fresh-artifacts` label in CI, improving workflow for external contributors.
- [#18551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18551)
- [#18557](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18557)

### Stability and Error Handling
A fuzzing failure in the `SystemConfig` test was addressed, improving the robustness of the system. The `op-batcher` was updated to exit the process on critical throttling RPC errors, preventing partial failures and ensuring system stability.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Node Synchronization and Stability
An issue where `op-node` v1.16.3 failed to synchronize was resolved by upgrading and resyncing `op-geth`. Additionally, a critical fix was implemented for `op-batcher` to ensure a full shutdown when "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" errors occur, preventing partial failures and enabling automatic recovery.

## NEW ISSUES

### Critical Contract Vulnerability
A critical bug has been reported in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` where `_7702Target = address(0)` causes a fuzzing test failure, indicating potential incorrect behavior when handling deposits involving a null address and its impact on aliasing. This issue has been flagged as a high priority for immediate resolution.
- [#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18554)

### CI/CD Optimization
An issue has been opened to remove the "Sign" step from the Docker publishing workflow in CircleCI, as it is no longer necessary, aiming to streamline the CI/CD process.
- [#18558](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18558)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Critical Contract Vulnerability: `_7702Target = address(0)` in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18554))
The discussion highlights the critical nature of this fuzzing test failure, which points to potentially incorrect behavior when handling deposits with a null address and its aliasing implications. The issue has been prioritized with `bug` and `critical` (or `security`) labels. An immediate assignment to a contracts developer is recommended to address the logical error in line 2688, where empty bytes are etched. The urgency stems from ensuring the L1/L2 bridge functions correctly even with extreme parameter values.
