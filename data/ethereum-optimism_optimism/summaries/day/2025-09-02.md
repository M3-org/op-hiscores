# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure by porting additional acceptance tests to Devstack and updating the `op-geth` dependency. Significant progress was made in improving `op-deployer` configurability and adding sync namespace support to `op-sync-tester`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
Efforts were concentrated on migrating existing acceptance tests to the Devstack environment, improving the robustness and coverage of the testing suite. This included porting Fjord (Holocene) tests and critical smoke tests.
- Ported Fjord (Holocene) tests to Devstack, requiring modifications to default fees in `init.go` e2e to ensure compatibility ([#16920](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16920)).
- Completed the migration of `TestSmokeTestFailure` and `TestInteropSystemNoop` to Devstack, finalizing the porting of remaining tests ([#17300](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17300)).
- Added support for the sync namespace (`sync_getSession`, `sync_deleteSession`, `sync_listSessions`) within `op-sync-tester`, enhancing its capabilities for session management and diagnostics ([#17299](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17299)).

### Dependency Updates and Deployment Enhancements
Key dependencies were updated, and the `op-deployer` tool received an important configurability improvement.
- Updated the `op-geth` dependency to `v1.16.2`, incorporating upstream merges ([#17228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17228)).
- Introduced a configurable `chainIntent.GasLimit` field in `op-deployer`, allowing users to set custom gas limits for chains in their intent files, with a default fallback to `standard.GasLimit` during initialization ([#17271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17271)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

- [#17307](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17307) `min-base-fee`: Integrates `op-geth` code related to minimum base fees.
- [#17309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17309) `fix(op-node)`: Fixes issues with p2p gossip parameters parsing.
- [#17310](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17310) `feat(op-acceptance-tests)`: Introduces `op-acceptor v3.1.0`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Sync Tester Functionality
The `op-sync-tester` now fully supports the sync namespace, enabling better session management and diagnostic capabilities for test harnesses.
- The issue tracking the implementation of `sync_getSession`, `sync_deleteSession`, and `sync_listSessions` in `op-sync-tester` has been closed ([#16778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16778)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Testing and Compatibility
New issues have been opened to address flakiness in existing tests and ensure compatibility with upcoming protocol changes.
- An issue was created to tame the flakiness of `TestPreNoInbox` in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17298)).
- Issues were opened to ensure `op-program` and Kona have passing action tests for Jovian ([#17302](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17302), [#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17303)).
- An issue was created to support U16a changes ([#17306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17306)).

### Protocol Design and Bug Tracking
Discussions have begun on the design of an aggregate dispute game, and a bug related to p2p gossip configuration has been identified.
- A new issue tracks the initial design phase for an aggregate dispute game (multi-proofs) ([#17305](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17305)).
- A bug was reported where `ConfigureGossip` in `op-node/p2p/gossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17308)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona + Cannon Compatibility
Discussions on [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17285) and [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17286) revolve around ensuring compatibility of `OPContractsManager` (OPCM) and `op-dispute-mon` with the Kona + Cannon game types. For OPCM, the main point is to support deploying the new game type, specifically updating the `if` block that handles game type implementations. For `op-dispute-mon`, the discussion clarified that it must return an error for unsupported game types and needs to be updated to specifically support `cannon-kona` game types, rather than just looking at "specific game types." The issue description for `op-dispute-mon` was updated to reflect this.
