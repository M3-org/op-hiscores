# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining contract security, enhancing AI-driven contract testing, standardizing test naming, and improving L2 synchronization mechanisms.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Contract Security and Deployment Enhancements
Protocol versions were added to restrictions to prevent non-deterministic optimizer results, improving contract verification reliability. Additionally, forge callers were set up for applying deploy scripts, preparing for more robust deployment processes.
- feat: add ProtocolVersions to restrictions ([#17651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17651))
- op-deployer: setup forge callers for apply deploy scripts ([#17637](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17637))

### AI-Driven Contract Testing Improvements
The AI contract testing system received updates to handle API timeouts with retries, prevent redundant work by excluding recently processed files, and address prompt issues, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of automated contract testing.
- fix(ai-contracts-test): handle 504 timeout, prevent duplicate work, prompt changes ([#17616](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17616))

### Test Suite Refinement and L2 Sync Optimization
Test contract naming was standardized by replacing "Unclassified" with "Uncategorized" for consistency. The L2 sync test was tweaked to verify chain advancement beyond genesis, and the `ReceivedUnsafePayloadEvent` was removed to streamline the rollup driver's synchronization logic.
- refactor(test): standardize Unclassified to Uncategorized in test naming ([#17650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17650))
- op-e2e: Tweak EL Sync Test to check non genesis ([#17440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17440))
- op-node/rollup: remove ReceivedUnsafePayloadEvent event ([#17530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17530))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **op-test-sequencer bug fixes**: A new pull request ([#17653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17653)) aims to fix bugs introduced by a previous change related to L1 Geth subprocess support.
- **op-geth upgrade**: Another pull request ([#17655](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17655)) proposes upgrading `op-geth` across the codebase.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks RPC Deployment and Evaluation
Several issues related to the deployment and evaluation of flashblocks-rpc nodes and rollup-boost as a flashblocks forwarder were closed. This included deploying a flashblocks-rpc node ([#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16764)), implementing rollup-boost as a flashblocks forwarder ([#17457](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17457)), deploying these changes on eris-0 ([#17458](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17458)), and conducting load tests for the flashblocks forwarder on eris-0 ([#17462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17462)). The load tests were performed and documented, with notes on latency due to geographical distance.

## NEW ISSUES

### Sequencer Block Progression
A new issue ([#17654](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17654)) has been opened regarding the sequencer not advancing blocks when the node is in ELSync. The problem requires diagnosing the failure mode and consolidating `sync.CLSync` and `sync.ELSync` into a consistent path.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### L2CL<>L2EL: Find out condition of L2EL for starting EL Syncing ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17628))
The discussion on this issue revolves around understanding the conditions under which the Execution Layer (EL) can start EL Syncing, particularly for `op-geth` with `op-sepolia`. Recent comments clarify that the EL client should simply sync, and the method of backfilling blocks (e.g., snap-sync vs. full block execution) is an implementation detail of the EL. The consensus is that the EL doesn't need to trigger snap-sync if it already has a finalized sync, but it will still sync to the new chain head. The ticket may be closed as the issue might be handled by `engineController.insertUnsafePayload` when removing ReqRes sync.
