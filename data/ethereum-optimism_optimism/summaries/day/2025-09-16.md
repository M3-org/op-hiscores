# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure for the `min-base-fee` feature, improving CI efficiency, and fixing bugs in the `op-deployer`. Significant progress was made in preparing for the Jovian activation and Fusaka.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing for Min-Base-Fee Feature
Extensive tests were added for the `min-base-fee` functionality, ensuring its correct behavior across various scenarios, including e2e and acceptance tests. This work involved updates to `kurtosis-devnet`, `op-acceptance-tests`, `op-devstack`, `op-e2e`, `op-node`, and `op-service` components. ([#17441](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17441))

### CI/CD and Developer Tooling Improvements
The CI pipeline saw an upgrade with the parallelization of `go-test` jobs, aiming for faster and more reliable test execution. Additionally, the `op-acceptor` tool was updated to v3.3.0, streamlining acceptance testing processes. ([#17467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17467), [#17468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17468))

### Bug Fixes in Deployment and Contract Verification
Several bugs in the `op-deployer`'s verification command were addressed, alongside fixes in `contracts-bedrock` that previously hindered proper contract verification. This improves the reliability of deployment processes. ([#17478](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17478))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Min-Base-Fee Feature Completion
Several issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature were closed, including the addition of acceptance tests ([#16841](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16841)), loading the minimum base fee value from `SystemConfig` contract events ([#17340](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17340)), and adding `actions/proof` tests ([#17479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17479)).

### Documentation and Deployment Fixes
A godoc fix for `MinBaseFee` in the `op-service SystemConfig` struct was completed ([#17480](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17480)). An issue regarding the installation of the forge binary in docker builds for the Forge Deployer was also resolved ([#17485](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17485)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Preparations for Fusaka and Jovian Activations
New issues were opened to prepare for upcoming network upgrades. This includes updating the `withdrawal op-chain-ops` command for U16a ([#17470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17470)) and preparing the `op-batcher` for Fusaka, which will require sending blob transactions with cell proofs instead of blob proofs ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17472)).

### Testing and Documentation Enhancements
An issue was created to re-add `op-reth` to the Jovian Kurtosis devnet once it supports the `min-base-fee` ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17475)). Further testing for `min-base-fee` was proposed by running `actions/proof` tests against Kona ([#17483](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17483)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `TestPreNoInbox` Flakiness
The issue [#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17298) concerning the flakiness of `TestPreNoInbox` in `op-acceptance-tests` remains active. A recent comment from `scharissis` on Sep 16, 2025, reported another flake, indicating the problem persists despite attempts to fix it. `pcw109550` later confirmed on Sep 17, 2025, that a recent PR did not resolve the issue.

### Token Bridging Clarification
Issue [#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1203) discusses a token bridging problem. `AlexBHarley` commented on Sep 16, 2025, suggesting that the token at `0x431151F26c48B4D4BEFc34048a0966Bf960A0c50` might not be an `OptimismMintableERC20`, which would explain why the generated entry lacks a bridge address. Verification of the implementation was suggested to confirm this.

### `protocol/system-config.md` Cleanup
Issue [#771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/771) focuses on cleaning up the `protocol/system-config.md` documentation. `joshklop` on Sep 16, 2025, relayed a suggestion from `sebastianst` to include both the numerical value and the canonical name (e.g., `MIN_BASE_FEE` and `6`) for config update enums, and to link to fork-specific specs for hard fork-added config updates.
