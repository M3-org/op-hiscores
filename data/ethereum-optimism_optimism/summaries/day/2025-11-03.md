# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on CI/testing improvements, `op-deployer` enhancements, and core protocol refactoring. Key updates include running upgrade tests with dev flags, optimizing `op-deployer` build processes, and centralizing fork definitions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/Testing Enhancements and Fixes
Significant work was done to improve the CI pipeline and testing infrastructure. This includes enabling dev flags for upgrade tests to ensure more comprehensive coverage ([#18133](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18133)), renaming a critical CI job to match required checks for proposal branches ([#18139](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18139)), and adding guidance for interpreting CI failures to streamline developer workflow ([#18127](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18127)).

### `op-deployer` Optimizations and Bug Fixes
The `op-deployer` tool received several updates to enhance its efficiency and correctness. This involved speeding up the `just build` command by using `build-no-tests` ([#18130](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18130)), updating `justfile` to use current CLI flags ([#18142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18142)), and fixing the default MIPS version and local `op-deployer` usage ([#18132](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18132), [#18129](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18129)).

### Core Protocol Refactoring and Cannon-Kona Support
The codebase saw refactoring efforts to improve organization and support new features. This included updating `OPContractsManager.migrate` to support Cannon-Kona games ([#18078](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18078)), removing unused `DeployProxy` solidity and Go scripts ([#18122](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18122)), and moving fork definitions into a new `op-core/forks` package for better modularity ([#18121](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18121)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   **Supernode and RPC Activities:** A new PR introduces runnable and RPC activities with a heartbeat example for `op-supernode` ([#18141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18141)).
*   **CI Improvements:** Updates to CI include using cached Solidity compilers ([#18140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18140)) and adjusting CI to use normal proof times ([#18134](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18134)).
*   **Testing Enhancements:** Efforts to improve testing include flake-shaking and test promotions in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#18128](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18128)) and enhancing RLPWriter test coverage ([#18119](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18119)).
*   **`op-node` Development:** A series of PRs focus on `op-node` improvements, covering context/timeout management ([#18117](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18117)), architecture documentation ([#18117](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18117)), retry systems ([#18116](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18116)), configuration validation ([#18115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18115)), unit tests for config functions ([#18114](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18114)), error handling and logging ([#18113](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18113)), health checks and graceful shutdowns ([#18112](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18112)), and enhanced metrics ([#18111](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18111)).
*   **Contract Updates:** A PR to update `ForkLive` to support Cannon Kona in contracts ([#18110](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18110)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Reporting
The issue regarding reporting unused acceptance tests ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16273)) has been closed. The decision was made as the team has switched to primarily using gateless mode, making the original requirement less relevant.

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-deployer` and `op-node` Functionality Concerns
*   **`op-deployer` Intent Issue:** An issue was opened regarding `op-deployer`'s `Intent.SuperchainConfigProxy` not working as expected, specifically concerning the re-use of the pause ability ([#18123](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18123)).
*   **`op-node` EL Sync Issues:** Two issues were identified in `op-node` related to safe head advancement during EL sync ([#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18124)) and the unsafe not being rewound when `INVALID` during EL sync ([#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18125)). These are tracking potential problems found during the deprecation of RR Sync.

### Testing and Flakiness
*   **`op-sync-tester` Support:** A new issue requests support for Jovian in `op-sync-tester` and the addition of Jovian HF tests ([#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18126)).
*   **Flaky Tests:** Two specific tests were identified as flaky: `TestBreakTimestampInvariant` ([#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18137)) and `TestMissingBatchE2E` ([#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18138)).
*   **Tracking BALs:** A general tracking issue for BALs was created ([#18136](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18136)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Documentation
Discussion on the [DA Footprint Limit] Documentation issue ([#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1742)) suggests that this issue could be tracked concurrently with the documentation efforts for the MinBaseFee feature ([docs#1710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1710)). The latest comment indicates that the issue is considered "pretty self explanatory" and could be integrated into existing documentation work. The issue emphasizes the importance of carefully setting the scalar to avoid excluding too much traffic or being ineffective against spam.
