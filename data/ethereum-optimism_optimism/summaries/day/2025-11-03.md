# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on CI/testing improvements, `op-deployer` optimizations, and core infrastructure refactoring, including updates for Cannon-Kona games and moving fork definitions to a new `op-core/forks` package.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/Testing Enhancements and Developer Experience
*   CI now runs upgrade tests with dev flags enabled for OP chains, improving test coverage and ensuring compatibility with development features ([#18133](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18133)).
*   Guidance was added to the prompt for interpreting CI status, helping developers focus on relevant failures and skip unrelated checks ([#18127](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18127)).
*   The `contracts-bedrock-tests` CI job was renamed to match required status checks, ensuring proper integration with proposal branches ([#18139](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18139)).

### `op-deployer` Optimizations and Fixes
*   The `just build` command in `op-deployer` now uses `build-no-tests` to speed up build times ([#18130](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18130)).
*   `op-deployer` was updated to use the default MIPS version (v8 for Go 1.24 support) and invoke `op-deployer` via `go run` instead of requiring a pre-built binary ([#18132](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18132), [#18129](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18129)).

### Core Infrastructure Updates
*   The `OPContractsManager.migrate` function was updated to support setting up `SUPER_CANNON_KONA` games when the `CANNON_KONA` dev feature is enabled ([#18078](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18078)).
*   Unused `DeployProxy` Solidity and Go scripts, along with their tests, were removed to streamline the codebase ([#18122](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18122)).
*   Fork names were moved into a new `op-core/forks` package, centralizing core protocol code and improving organization ([#18121](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18121)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

*   [#18119](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18119) enhances RLPWriter test coverage and organization for contracts.
*   A series of PRs ([#18118](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18118), [#18117](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18117), [#18116](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18116), [#18115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18115), [#18114](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18114), [#18113](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18113), [#18112](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18112), [#18111](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18111)) focus on `op-node` improvements, including context/timeout management, architecture documentation, retry systems, configuration validation, unit tests, error handling, structured logging, health checks, graceful shutdowns, and enhanced metrics.
*   [#18110](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18110) updates contracts to support ForkLive for Cannon Kona.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Reporting
*   The issue of discovering and reporting unused acceptance tests ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16273)) has been closed. The team no longer deems this necessary as they have switched to primarily using gateless mode for tests.

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-deployer` and `op-node` Functionality Concerns
*   An issue was reported regarding `op-deployer`'s `Intent.SuperchainConfigProxy` not working as expected, specifically concerning the re-use of the pause ability ([#18123](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18123)).
*   Potential issues were identified in `op-node` related to safe head advancement during EL Sync ([#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18124)) and the unsafe not being rewound when `INVALID` during EL Sync ([#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18125)). These are tracking tickets from the deprecation of RR Sync.

### Testing and Flakiness
*   A new issue was opened to support Jovian in `op-sync-tester` and add Jovian HF tests ([#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18126)).
*   Tracking issues were created for flaky tests: `TestBreakTimestampInvariant` ([#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18137)) and `TestMissingBatchE2E` ([#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18138)).
*   A tracking issue for BALs was also created ([#18136](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18136)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Documentation
*   Discussion on the DA Footprint Limit Documentation ([#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1742)) continues, with the latest comment suggesting that this issue could be tracked concurrently with the documentation of the MinBaseFee feature. The commenter believes the issue is "pretty self explanatory." The documentation should emphasize the risks of setting the scalar too high (excluding traffic) or too low (ineffective protection against spam/backlogs) and its relationship with Gas Limit changes.
