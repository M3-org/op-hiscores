# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in foundational technology with the introduction of OPCM v2, enhancing contract management. Improvements were also made to deployment verification processes and test validation scripts.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Contract Management and Deployment Enhancements
A major feature, OPCM v2, was introduced, significantly overhauling contract management within the Bedrock contracts. This includes new interfaces, updated deployment scripts, and extensive testing for the new version. Additionally, support for Blockscout verification was added to the `VerifyOPCM` script, improving deployment verification flexibility.

- [#18373](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18373)
- [#18384](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18384)

### Scripting and Testing Infrastructure Improvements
The test validation script was updated to correctly check interfaces and libraries, resolving a previous oversight. A new script for deploying the `FeesDepositor` was also added, following established deployment patterns.

- [#18223](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18223)

### Network Configuration and Acceptance Testing
The default activation of the Jovian fork at genesis for new chains was implemented in the `op-deployer`. Acceptance tests for Ecotone fees were updated to run only against compatible networks.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Default Fork Activation
The issue concerning making Jovian the default fork to activate at genesis for new chains has been resolved. This update ensures that new chains will default to the Jovian fork configuration.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node sequencer recover mode bug ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18350))
Discussion continues regarding a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recover mode. The issue describes a scenario where the sequencer enters recover mode during normal operation, leading to "not found" errors when requesting L1 origin blocks that do not yet exist. This prevents the L1 origin from advancing and can violate the sequencer drift rule, potentially stalling derivation if a bad batch gets on L1. A possible fix snippet was proposed by @sebastianst to prevent temporary errors when recover mode catches up to the tip. @geoknee noted that the temporary error might persist even with the proposed fix and is investigating the influence of async L1 origin fetching. The core challenge is ensuring recover mode correctly handles L1 origin advancement without stalling or violating sequencer drift rules.
