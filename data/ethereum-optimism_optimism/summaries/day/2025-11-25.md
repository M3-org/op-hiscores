# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant advancements in the OP Contracts Manager (OPCM) with the introduction of OPCM v2, alongside enhancements to deployment verification processes. Key updates also include the activation of Jovian at genesis by default for new chains and the addition of a script for deploying the FeesDepositor.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### OP Contracts Manager (OPCM) v2 Development
A major feature, OPCM v2, has been introduced, involving extensive changes across contracts, interfaces, and deployment scripts. This update includes new interfaces for `IOPContractsManager`, `ISystemConfig`, and `IStorageSetter`, along with new contract implementations for `OPContractsManager` and `SystemConfig`. The development also encompasses new test cases and snapshot updates for ABI and storage layouts, indicating a significant overhaul of the contracts management system.

### Enhanced Deployment Verification
Support for Blockscout has been added to the `VerifyOPCM` script, making it the default verification method. This enhancement improves the flexibility and robustness of contract verification during deployment.

- [#18384](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18384)

### Core Infrastructure and Deployment Tooling
The `op-deployer` now activates Jovian at genesis by default, streamlining the setup for new chains. Additionally, a new script for deploying the `FeesDepositor` has been added, following established deployment patterns and including corresponding tests. A bug fix was also implemented to validate interfaces and libraries during test artifact checking, ensuring more comprehensive test coverage.

## NEW ISSUES

### OPCMv2 Enhancements and Future Work
Two new issues have been opened concerning OPCMv2. One highlights the need to use `getStartingAnchorRoot` once U18 is deployed for better diff reduction ([#18381](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18381)). The other points out the need to remove the `DelayedWETH` allowance in a future upgrade, as it's currently permitted for re-deployment to support the unified `DelayedWETH` model ([#18382](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18382)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node sequencer recover mode
Discussion continues on a possible bug in the `op-node` sequencer recover mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18350)). The latest comments indicate that when the sequencer is in recover mode but the chain is "healthy," it might request an L1 origin block that doesn't exist, leading to "not found" errors. This prevents the L1 origin from advancing and can violate the sequencer drift rule, potentially stalling derivation if a bad batch gets on L1. Possible solutions include rewinding the sequencer and turning off recover mode, or turning off recover mode and allowing the bad batch to be reorged out. The current implementation's temporary error might persist, and an explicit check on sequencer drift is being skipped in recover mode. The influence of async L1 origin fetching from a previous PR is also being investigated. A possible fix snippet has been proposed to prevent temporary errors when recovery mode catches up to the tip.
