# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on solidifying the Cannon-Kona and DisputeGame-V2 as default behaviors by removing feature flags, enhancing AI contract testing with no-change tracking, and improving `op-deployer` error handling. Significant work also went into supporting `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrades and integrating new submodules for acceptance testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dispute Game V2 and Cannon-Kona Defaulting
The project moved towards making Cannon-Kona and DisputeGame-V2 the default behavior by removing associated feature flags. This change streamlines the system by eliminating the need for explicit toggles for these core components.
- Removed Cannon-Kona dgv2 feature flags ([#18208](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18208)).

### Enhanced AI Contract Testing and Deployment Tooling
Improvements were made to the AI-driven contract testing framework to prevent redundant analysis and to the `op-deployer` for better error handling and upgrade support.
- Added no-changes tracking to AI contracts test to prevent ranker loops ([#18601](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18601)).
- Fixed error handling in `add_game_type` CLI parsing within `op-deployer` ([#18591](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18591)).
- Implemented support for `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrades in `op-deployer` and `op-validator` ([#18586](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18586), [#18585](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18585)).

### Acceptance Testing Infrastructure Updates
The acceptance testing environment was bolstered by integrating new submodules and improving the discovery and compilation of necessary binaries.
- Added Kona, Rollup-Boost, and OP-Rbuilder submodules for acceptance testing, replacing environment variable requirements with automatic binary discovery and optional JIT compilation ([#18540](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18540)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A total of 14 new pull requests were opened today, covering a range of features, chore tasks, and fixes. Key new features include core filtering logic for `op-interop-filter` ([#18603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18603)) and a fallback mechanism to L1 if AltDA fails ([#18602](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18602)). Several chore PRs were opened to skip specific AI tests that already have comprehensive coverage ([#18600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18600), [#18599](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18599), [#18598](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18598), [#18597](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18597), [#18596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18596), [#18595](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18595)). Other notable PRs include adding a timeout to `vm-runner` ([#18594](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18594)), adding OPCM v2 support for chain upgrades to `op-deployer` ([#18593](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18593)), and improvements to L1 origin selection in `op-node/sequencing` ([#18589](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18589)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Feature Toggle Removal
The issue concerning the removal of feature toggles for Kona and Cannon was closed today, indicating the successful integration and defaulting of these components.
- Kona + Cannon: remove feature toggles ([#18181](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18181)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Release Process Documentation
A new issue was opened to address the need for comprehensive documentation regarding the release process.
- Write a p/ps for our release process ([#18592](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18592)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Replica Healthcheck for op-rbuilder
The issue [#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17685), which proposes a dedicated replica healthcheck for `op-rbuilder` to ensure it does not diverge from `op-geth`, received a new comment today. User "Himess" expressed interest in taking on this task, indicating potential progress on this issue.
