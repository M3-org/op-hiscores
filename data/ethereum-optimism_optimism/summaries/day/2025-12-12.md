# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on solidifying the Cannon-Kona and DisputeGame-V2 as default behaviors by removing feature flags, enhancing AI contract testing with no-changes tracking, and improving error handling in the `op-deployer` CLI. Significant work was also done on integrating `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrades and adding new submodules for acceptance testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Protocol Enhancements & Feature Flag Removal
The project moved to make `cannon-kona` and `disputegame-v2` the default behavior by removing their associated feature flags, streamlining the core protocol. This change simplifies the deployment process and ensures these advanced features are standard.
- Removed `cannon-kona` dgv2 feature flags ([#18208](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18208))

### Improved Testing Infrastructure & AI Contract Test Maintenance
Significant updates were made to the testing framework, including the addition of new submodules for acceptance testing and a crucial fix to prevent AI contract test ranker loops. These improvements enhance the reliability and efficiency of the testing process.
- Added Kona, Rollup-Boost, and OP-Rbuilder submodules for acceptance testing ([#18540](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18540))
- Fixed AI contracts test by adding no-changes tracking to prevent ranker loops ([#18601](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18601))

### `op-deployer` and `op-validator` Updates
The `op-deployer` received a critical fix for error handling in its `add_game_type` CLI parsing, preventing erroneous exits. Additionally, both `op-deployer` and `op-validator` were updated to support the `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrade, ensuring compatibility with the latest contract versions.
- Fixed error handling in `add_game_type` CLI parsing in `op-deployer` ([#18591](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18591))
- Cherry-picked `op-deployer` 5.0.0 upgrade validation ([#18586](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18586))
- `op-deployer` now supports `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrade ([#18585](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18585))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A total of 14 new pull requests were opened today, covering a range of features, fixes, and chore tasks. Key new features include implementing core filtering logic for `op-interop-filter` ([#18603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18603)) and adding a fallback to L1 if AltDA fails ([#18602](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18602)). Several chore PRs were opened to skip specific AI tests that already have comprehensive coverage ([#18600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18600), [#18599](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18599), [#18598](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18598), [#18597](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18597), [#18596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18596), [#18595](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18595)). Other notable PRs include adding a timeout to `vm-runner` ([#18594](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18594)), adding OPCM v2 support for chain upgrades to `op-deployer` ([#18593](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18593)), verifying OPCM v2 ([#18590](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18590)), improving L1 origin selection in `op-node/sequencing` ([#18589](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18589)), removing cannon-kona dgv2 feature flags ([#18588](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18588)), and avoiding `claimData` calls for non-matching game types in `op-proposer` ([#18587](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18587)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Feature Toggle Removal
The issue concerning the removal of feature toggles for Kona and Cannon has been successfully closed today, indicating that these features are now considered stable and integrated into the main codebase without the need for toggles.

## NEW ISSUES

### Release Process Documentation
A new issue has been opened to address the need for comprehensive documentation regarding the release process. This highlights a focus on improving operational clarity and standardization.
- Write a p/ps for our release process ([#18592](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18592))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-rbuilder` Replica Healthcheck
The discussion around implementing a replica healthcheck for `op-rbuilder` is ongoing. The latest comment from Himess indicates interest in taking on this task, suggesting potential progress on this issue. The healthcheck aims to ensure `op-rbuilder` does not diverge from `op-geth`, maintaining consistency within the system.
