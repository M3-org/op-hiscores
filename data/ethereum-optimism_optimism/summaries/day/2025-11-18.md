# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 18, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing smart contract functionality, fixing critical build and Cannon issues, and improving testing infrastructure. Significant progress was made on Light CL features and preparing for ZK game support, alongside addressing several long-standing issues related to the Superchain Registry.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Smart Contract Enhancements and Build Process Improvements
A new feature was added to the `SystemConfig.sol` contract, allowing for an address overload in `setBatcherHash` ([#18298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18298)). Critical bug fixes addressed a failing artifact publishing job due to a shell typo ([#18275](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18275)) and enabled a fallback mechanism for contract artifact builds to optimize PR testing ([#18310](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18310)).

### Cannon and Sync Tester Updates
Support for state version 7 in Cannon's latest Docker builds was fixed by ensuring older Cannon versions are used for compatibility ([#18311](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18311)). Additionally, Cannon was updated to ensure temporary files are properly removed before exiting ([#18312](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18312)). The `op-sync-tester` received updates to include Verifier Engine APIs for Jovian, enhancing testing capabilities ([#18307](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18307)).

### Light CL Development
Progress was made on the Light CL feature within `op-node` by introducing frontend flags for `l2.unsafe-only` and `l2.follow.source`, providing more control over L2 synchronization behavior ([#18270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18270)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#18324](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18324) aims to unify the transport websocket client and update devstack and conductor to use it.
- [#18318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18318) proposes adding subprocess flashblocks support to `sysgo`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Registry and Hardfork Management
Several issues related to the Superchain Registry (SCR) and hardfork management were closed. This includes changes to the `add-chain` tool to allow chains to opt-in to hardforks ([#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/610)), and updates to the `golang-validate-all` CI job for better pass/fail summaries ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/644)). An investigation into L2 key handover tests was also closed as no longer relevant after SCR 2.0 refactor ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/643)).

### Jovian Hardfork and Sync Tester Support
Issues related to the Jovian hardfork were resolved, including adding explicit tests for setting operator fee parameters before Jovian activation ([#17897](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17897)) and patching the Sync Tester to support Jovian and add relevant tests ([#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18126)).

### Build and Deployment Process Improvements
A long-standing issue regarding how `standard-versions.toml` is used in `op-deployer` was closed, indicating a move away from file I/O patterns for this configuration ([#12067](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12067)). Additionally, a critical issue concerning failing artifact publishing workflows was resolved ([#18273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18273)).

## NEW ISSUES

### ZK Game Support and Infrastructure
A series of new issues were opened to track the development of ZK game support. This includes monitoring ZK games and reporting output agreement ([#18323](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18323)), updating `vm-runner` to support ZK proof programs ([#18325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18325)), and adding acceptance tests for ZK games ([#18326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18326)). Spikes were also created to investigate which service should generate ZK proofs ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18319)) and how to support challenging ZK games ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18322)).

### Light CL Implementation Milestones
New issues outline the milestones for the Light CL feature. This includes a tracking issue for Light CL development ([#18315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18315)), disabling derivation in `op-node` with an `--l2.unsafe-only` flag ([#18316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18316)), and implementing external following for safe/finalized data using a `--l2.follow.source` flag ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18317)).

### Proposer Metrics and Challenger Updates
New issues address exposing metrics for proving tokens in the proposer ([#18320](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18320)) and updating `op-challenger` to support challenging ZK game types ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18321)).

### Jovian Fork Activation
An issue was created to make Jovian the default fork to activate at genesis for new chains ([#18314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18314)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cleanup of Event System Refactor Comments ([#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16917))
The issue was reopened due to numerous outstanding TODOs related to the event system refactor. The discussion highlights the need to move these TODOs from code comments to GitHub issues for better tracking.

### `op-devstack`: `sysext`: fix address book ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15817))
This issue was reopened as there are still TODOs related to updating the hardcoded address keys in the `sysext` address book, which became outdated after the `kt` local devnet description was updated.

### `op-supervisor`: Drop multi-node support ([#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16174))
The issue was reopened due to a remaining TODO referencing it. The discussion from May 2025 suggested dropping multi-node support completely for now and re-introducing it later.

### Interop: Remove anchor point RPC ([#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16140))
This issue was reopened due to several TODOs still referencing it. The original discussion noted that the anchor block RPC is no longer used, but the database is initialized from genesis data if Interop is active at genesis.

### `op-node`: Let sync-start not cross into Interop activation ([#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16141))
The issue was reopened due to a remaining TODO. The `op-node`'s sync-start algorithm needs to be aware of Interop activation, as it's not responsible for resets post-Interop. The latest comment emphasizes using GitHub issues over TODOs in code.

### `op-supervisor`: remove check-access-list backward compat chainID fallback ([#16245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16245))
This issue was reopened due to several TODOs still referencing it. The `op-supervisor` currently implements backward compatibility for the chainID in the access-list check RPC, which should be removed once `op-reth` is updated.

### `op-node`: On the Initial EL Sync UX and Correctness ([#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17631))
The latest comment suggests addressing this issue once req/res sync is fully deprecated. An earlier observation highlighted an edge case during initial EL Sync where `insertUnsafePayload` might miss a state transition if `newPayload` returns SYNCING.

### `op-node`: Safe Head Advancement during EL Sync ([#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18124))
The latest comment indicates this issue can be punted until the full deprecation of RR sync. It tracks a potential issue found during the deprecation of RR Sync.

### `op-node`: Unsafe not rewound while `INVALID` during EL Sync ([#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18125))
Similar to [#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18124), this issue can also be punted until the full deprecation of RR sync. It tracks a potential issue where the unsafe head is not rewound on invalid states during EL Sync.

### `fusaka-on-l2`: finalize design ([#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/355))
The latest comment indicates that the design will be finalized after
