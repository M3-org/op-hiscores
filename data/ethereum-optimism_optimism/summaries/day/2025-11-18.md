# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 18, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing contract functionality, fixing critical build and Cannon issues, and improving testing infrastructure. Significant progress was made in supporting the upcoming Jovian hardfork and laying groundwork for ZK game integration.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Contract Enhancements and Bug Fixes
A new feature was added to the `SystemConfig` contract, allowing for an address overload in the `setBatcherHash` function ([#18298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18298)). Critical bug fixes addressed a failing artifact publishing job due to a shell typo ([#18275](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18275)) and ensured proper support for state version 7 in Cannon's latest Docker builds ([#18311](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18311)).

### Testing and CI/CD Improvements
Improvements were made to the CI/CD pipeline by enabling a fallback mechanism for contract artifact builds to optimize PR testing ([#18310](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18310)). The `op-sync-tester` was updated to include Verifier Engine APIs for the Jovian hardfork, expanding testing capabilities ([#18307](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18307)).

### Node and Cannon Tooling Updates
The `op-node` received updates to its light CL frontend flags, introducing optional `l2.unsafe-only` and `l2.follow.source` configurations ([#18270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18270)). Additionally, Cannon's `multicannon` tool was improved to ensure temporary files are properly removed before exiting by returning `cli.Exit` errors instead of using `os.Exit` ([#18312](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18312)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#18324](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18324) Unify on a single transport websocket client and update devstack and conductor to use it
- [#18318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18318) Add subprocess flashblocks support to sysgo

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Registry and Deployment Process Refinements
Several issues related to the Superchain Registry (SCR) and deployment tools were closed, indicating progress in streamlining these processes. This includes changes to how `standard-versions.toml` is used in `op-deployer` ([#12067](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12067)), modifications to the `add-chain` tool to allow chains to opt into hardforks ([#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/610)), and updates to the `golang-validate-all` CI job for better pass/fail summaries ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/644)). An investigation into L2 key handover tests was also concluded as no longer relevant after SCR 2.0 refactor ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/643)).

### Jovian Hardfork Readiness
Issues related to the upcoming Jovian hardfork were addressed, including adding explicit tests for setting operator fee parameters before Jovian activation ([#17897](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17897)) and patching the `op-sync-tester` to support Jovian and add relevant tests ([#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18126)).

### CI/CD and Build Stability
A critical issue concerning failing artifact publishing workflows was resolved ([#18273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18273)), improving the stability of the CI/CD pipeline.

## NEW ISSUES

### ZK Game Integration and Support
A series of new issues were opened to track the integration and support for ZK games within the Optimism ecosystem. This includes monitoring ZK games and reporting on output agreement and expected root claims in `dispute-mon` ([#18323](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18323)), updating `vm-runner` to support running ZK proof programs ([#18325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18325)), and adding acceptance tests for ZK games ([#18326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18326)). Further spikes were created to investigate which service should generate ZK proofs ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18319)) and how to support challenging ZK games ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18322)).

### Light CL Development and Milestones
Several issues were created to track the development of the Light CL feature. This includes a tracking issue for the overall Light CL project ([#18315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18315)), and specific milestones for disabling derivation with `--l2.unsafe-only` ([#18316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18316)) and following external sources with `--l2.follow.source` ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18317)).

### Proposer Metrics and Fork Activation
New issues include exposing metrics for proving tokens in the proposer ([#18320](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18320)) and making Jovian the default fork to activate at genesis for new chains ([#18314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18314)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Persistent TODOs and Deprecated Features
Discussions on several long-standing issues highlight the presence of numerous TODOs in the codebase, particularly related to the Event System Refactor ([#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16917)). Comments from ajsutton indicate a need to move these TODOs to GitHub issues for better tracking. Issues like `op-devstack: sysext: fix address book` ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15817)), `op-supervisor: Drop multi-node support` ([#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16174)), `Interop: Remove anchor point RPC` ([#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16140)), and `op-node: Let sync-start not cross into Interop activation` ([#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16141)) were reopened due to remaining TODOs or ongoing relevance despite previous attempts to close them. The `op-supervisor: remove check-access-list backward compat chainID fallback` issue ([#16245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16245)) also has outstanding TODOs.

### EL Sync and Deprecation of RR Sync
Discussions around `op-node: On the Initial EL Sync UX and Correctness` ([#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17631)), `op-node: Safe Head Advancement during EL Sync` ([#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18124)), and `op-node: Unsafe not rewound while INVALID during EL Sync` ([#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18125)) indicate that these issues are being punted until the full deprecation of Request/Response (RR) sync. mslipper commented that these are to be addressed once RR sync is fully deprecated. pcw109550 provided a detailed observation on an edge case during initial EL Sync for `insertUnsafePayload` in issue [#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17631).

### Fusaka-on-L2 Design Finalization
The issue `fusaka-on-l2: finalize design` ([#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/355)) remains active, with mslipper commenting that finalization will occur after checking with customers.
