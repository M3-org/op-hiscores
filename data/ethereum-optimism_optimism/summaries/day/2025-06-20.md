# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jun 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the opening of two new pull requests focusing on `op-supervisor` consistency testing and `devnet-sdk` validation. Several new issues were opened concerning `op-node` interop logic and reset improvements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No completed work to report for this day.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened today:
- A fix to add read handle consistency testing for `op-supervisor` ([#16518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16518)).
- A feature to add chain descriptor validation to the `devnet-sdk` ([#16523](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16523)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

No issues were closed on this day.

## NEW ISSUES

### Interop Mode for `op-node`
Several new issues were opened to discuss and implement different modes for `op-node` to handle interop logic, particularly for trivial interop cases without requiring a supervisor:
- An issue to allow `op-node` to work in a trivial-interop mode without a supervisor ([#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16519)).
- An issue to add a mode for `op-node` to use pre-Interop logic in the trivial-Interop case ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16520)).
- An issue to add a shim to `op-node` to provide Interop proofs RPCs for the trivial-Interop case ([#16521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16521)).

### Improved Reset Logic
A new issue was created to improve the reset logic for `op-node` and `op-supervisor`, consolidating related existing issues ([#16524](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16524)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### GoReleaser for Release Pipeline
Discussion continued on using GoReleaser for the `op-node`/`batcher`/`proposer`/`challenger` release pipeline ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16097)). The latest comments focus on improving changelog generation. @geoknee suggested wiring up `op-workbench` to automatically execute `git cliff` commands for release notes and potentially push them to GitHub. They also provided a lighter-weight solution for changelog generation using `git cliff`. Earlier discussions highlighted the need to consolidate build systems and avoid adding more ways to build services without removing existing ones, emphasizing a monorepo-first approach for GoReleaser.
