# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, particularly for Pectra and Ecotone features, and improving deployment tools. Significant work was also done on gnosis CLI utilities and migrating custom memory reservation tests.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing and Devstack Integration
Efforts were made to port Pectra and Ecotone tests to the devstack environment, integrating them into the acceptance test suite. This expands the coverage and robustness of the testing framework. Additionally, custom memory reservation tests for Cannon were migrated to a new DiffTester framework, streamlining differential testing.

- [#16727](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16727)

### Deployment Tooling Improvements
A new command was added to `op-deployer` to simplify `OPCM.migrate` calls, enhancing the deployment process. This streamlines a critical operation for chain management.

### Gnosis CLI and Interoperability Updates
Work continued on the Gnosis CLI, including adding a command-line interface for sending transactions and refactoring code for better modularity and importability into other projects like `netchef`. Furthermore, `rollup.interopmempoolfiltering` was added to ELs in Kurtosis, aiming to align the acceptance test topology more closely with production environments.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolution of Interop Test Failures
An issue where interop acceptance tests were failing due to an `op-geth` version bump has been closed. The resolution is expected to come from a related pull request.
- [#16731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16731)

### Interop Network Acceptance Test Closure
The long-standing issue to add an acceptance test for basic interop network functionality has been closed, with the note that it will be handled by the Protocol team.
- [#298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/298)

## NEW ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Topology Discrepancy
A new issue has been opened to address the discrepancy between the current local Kurtosis interop devnet topology and the production environment. The current setup exposes the sequencer publicly, which does not match real-world production topologies.
