# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 6, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes for FFI builds and updates to acceptance tests, alongside active community engagement on several open issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Build System Enhancements
A critical bug affecting FFI builds with blobless checkouts was resolved by reintroducing full checkouts for affected builds, ensuring build stability and reliability ([#18527](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18527)).

### Testing Infrastructure Updates
The `op-acceptance-tests` were updated to `v3.8.0` of `op-acceptor` and a new chore was added to delete acceptance testing log directories older than 60 days to prevent disk space issues ([#18530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18530), [#18529](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18529)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request was opened to add `ReinitializableBase` test to the exclusion list for AI engineering ([#18531](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18531)).
- Another pull request was opened to use file-based sequencer key loading for Kona in `op-devstack` ([#18528](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18528)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Contract Interface Clarification
Discussion continued on whether `IOptimismMintableERC20.bridge` should be a view function ([#9697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/9697)). A community member, Himess, inquired about taking on the issue.

### MIPS64 Memory Comments
Community members, including Himess, expressed interest in addressing issues related to incorrect comments in `MIPS64Memory.sol` regarding byte size versus word size ([#13435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13435)) and inaccurate return value descriptions for `readMem` and `readMemUnchecked` ([#13436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13436)).

### Bedrock Contracts Test Setup
Himess also inquired about working on the issue where the Bedrock contracts test setup fails due to incorrect Solady library mapping ([#15220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15220)).

### Devnet Spammer Component
Discussion on creating a new `op-spammer` component for devnet deployments continued, with scharissis highlighting `flashbots/contender` as prior art ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18482)).

### Batcher Code Simplification
Himess expressed interest in taking on the task of removing `isPectra` from the batcher, noting that it would involve changes in approximately five Go files ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18479)).

### op-node Synchronization Issues
A user reported `op-node` synchronization issues after upgrading to `v1.16.3` ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18510)). geoknee requested more detailed logs and metrics, suggesting that the reported log line is not uncommon after a restart and recommended upgrading `op-geth`.
