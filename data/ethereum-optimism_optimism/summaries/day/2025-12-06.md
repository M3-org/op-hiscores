# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 6, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes for FFI builds and updates to acceptance tests, alongside active community engagement on several open issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Build System Enhancements
A critical bug affecting FFI builds with blobless checkouts was resolved by reintroducing full checkouts for affected builds, ensuring build stability ([#18527](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18527)).

### Testing Infrastructure Updates
The `op-acceptance-tests` were updated to `v3.8.0` of `op-acceptor`, improving testing capabilities. Additionally, a chore was implemented to delete acceptance testing logs older than 60 days to prevent disk space issues ([#18530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18530), [#18529](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18529)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request was opened to add `ReinitializableBase` test to the exclusion list for AI engineering ([#18531](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18531)).
- Another pull request was opened to update `op-devstack` to use file-based sequencer key loading for Kona ([#18528](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18528)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Contract Interface Clarification
Community members inquired about the status of an issue regarding `IOptimismMintableERC20.bridge` potentially being a view function, with Himess asking "Is it live ? Can i take ?" ([#9697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/9697)).

### Documentation and Comment Accuracy
Discussions continued on issues related to incorrect comments in `MIPS64Memory.sol`. Himess expressed interest in taking on the task of correcting comments about word size and return values for `readMem` and `readMemUnchecked` ([#13435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13435), [#13436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13436)).

### Bedrock Contracts Test Setup
Himess also inquired about contributing to the issue concerning the `op-program` Bedrock contracts test setup failing due to incorrect Solady library mapping, asking "Can i work on this ?" ([#15220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15220)).

### Devnet Spammer Component
Discussion on creating a new `op-spammer` component for devnet deployments included a suggestion from scharissis to consider `flashbots/contender` as prior art ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18482)).

### Batcher Code Simplification
Himess expressed interest in taking on the task of removing `isPectra` from the batcher, noting that changes would be needed in approximately five Go files ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18479)).

### `op-node` Synchronization Issues
Regarding the `op-node` v1.16.3 update causing synchronization problems, geoknee requested more detailed logs and metrics, particularly concerning safe and unsafe heads, and recommended upgrading `op-geth` to `v1.101603.5` ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18510)).
