# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining testing infrastructure by replacing mock contracts with Foundry's built-in `vm` functions, enhancing efficiency and reducing code overhead. Several new pull requests were opened, indicating active development across various components.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Testing Infrastructure Refinement
The testing suite saw an improvement with the replacement of mock contracts with `vm.mock` functions, streamlining the testing process for `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, `FeeVault`, `L2CrossDomainMessenger`, `SequencerFeeVault`, and `Transactor` within the `contracts-bedrock` package. This change aims to simplify test setups and reduce reliance on custom mock implementations. ([#18388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18388))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A pull request titled "break opcmv1, rebuild op-deployer" ([#18438](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18438)) was opened, suggesting significant changes to the `op-deployer` and potentially the `opcmv1` component.
- Two pull requests, "test/falco" ([#18437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18437)) and "falco/reproduce codeql error" ([#18434](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18434)), indicate work related to Falco testing and reproducing CodeQL errors.
- A pull request to disable CodeQL ([#18436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18436)) and another to reproduce a CodeQL error in an unprotected context ([#18435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18435)) were opened.
- A pull request to remove `TraceType` and use `GameType` in `op-challenger` ([#18433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18433)) was initiated.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-deployer` Configuration Issue Resolved
An issue where `op-deployer` reverted when using custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values has been closed. The problem was identified as a validation check requiring `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` to be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration`. The resolution involved overriding `PreimageOracleChallengePeriod` for testnet deployments. ([#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18407))
