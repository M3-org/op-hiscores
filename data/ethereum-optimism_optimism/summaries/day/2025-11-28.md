# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining testing infrastructure by replacing mock contracts with Foundry's built-in `vm` functions, enhancing efficiency and reducing code overhead. Several new pull requests were opened, indicating active development across various components.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Testing Infrastructure Refinement
The testing suite saw an improvement with the replacement of mock contracts with `vm.mock` functions in several test files. This change streamlines testing by leveraging Foundry's native capabilities, reducing the need for custom mock contracts. The `GasBurner` contract remains as the only mock contract without a direct `vm.sol` replacement. ([#18388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18388))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **OP-Deployer and OPCMv1 Updates:** A pull request was opened to break `opcmv1` and rebuild `op-deployer` ([#18438](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18438)).
- **CodeQL and Falco Related PRs:** Several pull requests are related to CodeQL and Falco, including `test/falco` ([#18437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18437)), `disabled codeql` ([#18436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18436)), `unprotected/reproduce codeql error` ([#18435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18435)), and `falco/reproduce codeql error` ([#18434](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18434)).
- **Op-Challenger Refinement:** A pull request aims to simplify the `op-challenger` by removing `TraceType` and directly using `GameType` ([#18433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18433)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fault Game Configuration
An issue regarding `op deployer` reverting with custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values was closed. The problem was identified as a validation check requiring `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` to be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration`. The user confirmed that overriding `PreimageOracleChallengePeriod` resolved the issue for testnet deployments. ([#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18407))
