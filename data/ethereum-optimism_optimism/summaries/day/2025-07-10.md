# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes in `op-node` and `op-supervisor` to enhance stability and prevent deadlocks. Significant progress was also made on integrating the Standard Validator into OPCM, alongside updates to documentation and testing infrastructure.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Protocol Stability and Reliability
Critical bug fixes were implemented to improve the stability of core Optimism components. The `op-node` received a fix to ensure proper mutex unlocking ([#16617](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16617)), preventing potential deadlocks. Similarly, the `op-supervisor` was updated to remove redundant locks and resolve a deadlock issue ([#16642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16642)), addressing previously reported event overflow and congestion problems.

### OPCM and Standard Validator Integration
Significant work was completed on integrating the Standard Validator into the Optimism Contracts Manager (OPCM) ([#16237](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16237)). This integration aligns the Standard Validator with existing OPCM patterns, enhancing the modularity and maintainability of the contract system.

### Developer Tooling and Documentation Improvements
Documentation for the Smart Contract Style Guide was updated to reflect new test conventions and validation workflows ([#16614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16614)), providing clearer guidelines for developers. Additionally, new log formats (`logfmtms` and `jsonms`) were added to `op-service` ([#16645](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16645)), improving logging capabilities for debugging and monitoring.

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
The `op-acceptance-tests` received an update to unify stopping conditions for interop load tests ([#16640](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16640)). This change streamlines testing procedures by ensuring consistent budget depletion or timeout conditions across different test schedules.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#16666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16666), was opened by Dependabot to bump the `github.com/docker/docker` dependency from `27.5.1+incompatible` to `28.3.2+incompatible`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Supervisor Stability and Event Handling
Several issues related to the `op-supervisor`'s stability and event handling were closed. This includes the resolution of an event overflow problem on large unsafe head gaps ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16335)) and an investigation into spikes of `local-derived` events ([#16603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16603)). The discussions highlighted the complexity of event processing within the supervisor, with initial speculation pointing towards `ChainsDB` or `GlobalSyncExec` deadlocks. While a full panic stack trace was desired for complete confirmation, the fixes implemented are expected to mitigate these issues.

### Interoperability and Genesis Configuration
An issue concerning the check for EL prestate regarding pre-interop `CrossL2Inbox` configuration faults ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15765)) was closed. The decision was made to close this issue as the execution client is not ideally positioned to perform this validation, and the risk of incorrect genesis generation has been significantly reduced through improvements in the `op-deployer` tooling. The `op-deployer` now automatically determines the inclusion of `CrossL2Inbox` based on the presence of multiple chains, ensuring correct deployment without requiring complex checks within the execution client.

### OPCM Integration of Standard Validator
The task to integrate the `StandardValidator` into the OPCM ([#15799](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15799)) was successfully closed. This work involved aligning the `StandardValidator` with existing OPCM patterns, such as `OPCMDeployer` and `OPCMUpgrader`, prioritizing consistency and minimizing complexity.

## NEW ISSUES

### Forge Test Linting Limitations
A new issue, [#16662](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16662), was opened to address limitations in the `lint-forge-tests-check-no-build` script. The script currently excludes test files under `test/libraries/` due to its inability to properly process artifacts for Solidity libraries, as it assumes contract-style ABIs. This prevents comprehensive linting for library-related tests.
