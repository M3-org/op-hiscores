## NEW ISSUES
Four new issues were opened today, primarily focusing on configurable parameters and system alerts:
- **Configurable System Parameters:**
    - [#16839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16839) proposes adding a `minBaseFee` configuration variable to the `SystemConfig` contract, including a new `setMinBaseFeeLog2` method and `ConfigUpdate` event.
    - [#16843](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16843) tracks the rollout and release of `op-batcher`.
- **Flashblocks System Alerts:**
    - [#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16867) suggests an alert for when a non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off, indicating a potential issue.
    - [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16868) proposes an alert for low peer count health of flashblocks-enabled sequencers, specifically when the count drops below 3 or 4.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Min Base Fee Tracking:**
    - [#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16807) continues to track the implementation of the minimum base fee. The latest comments highlight ongoing work, including a reth draft ([https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/17704](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/17704)) and related in-flight work on op-alloy ([https://github.com/alloy-rs/op-alloy/pull/580](https://github.com/alloy-rs/op-alloy/pull/580)) and a relevant pull request ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16852)).
