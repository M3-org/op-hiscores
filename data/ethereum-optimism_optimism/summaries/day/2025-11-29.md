## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Documentation Clarity for Simulation Links
Discussion continued on [#789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/789) regarding updating `NESTED.md` and `SINGLE.md` to reflect changes in Base's simulation link printing. Himess noted that while some updates have occurred since the issue's creation in March, further clarification is possible. A PR ([#1311](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/1311)) has been submitted to provide more detailed guidance, with Himess offering to close the issue if the PR is deemed sufficient.

### Porting SuperchainConfig Type
On [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/741), Himess provided an update on porting the `SuperchainConfig` type from `superchain-registry`. Documentation for the `SuperchainDefinition` type has been added to the specs, with a commit available for review. Himess inquired if this meets the original request and noted that the referenced PR ([op-rs/kona#2562](https://github.com/op-rs/kona/pull/2562)) does not appear directly related to this specific change. Himess is ready to open a PR if the proposed changes are satisfactory.
