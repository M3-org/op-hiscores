### Documentation Clarity for Simulation Links
Discussion on [#789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/789) revolved around updating `NESTED.md` and `SINGLE.md` to reflect Base's new two-step simulation link format. A user noted the issue was old but still relevant for clearer documentation, suggesting a new PR for more detailed guidance or closing the issue.

### Superchain Configuration Type Porting
On [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/741), there was a discussion about porting the `SuperchainConfig` type from `superchain-registry` to the specs. A user provided a commit with documentation for the `SuperchainDefinition` type, asking for confirmation if it met the requirements and noting a potential discrepancy with a referenced PR.
