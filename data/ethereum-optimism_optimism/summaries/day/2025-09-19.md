# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in developer tooling with new integration tests for `op-deployer` and fixes for CI/CD processes. Security was also a focus with the addition of a new security review report. Several key issues related to Superchain integration and address struct standardization were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Deployment Tooling and Testing
Improvements were made to the `op-deployer` with the introduction of CLI-based integration tests, ensuring more robust testing of deployment workflows. Additionally, fixes were implemented to address issues with Forge verbose installation and version checks within the CI environment.
- [#17511](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17511)
- [#17534](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17534)
- [#17540](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17540)
- [#17541](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17541)

### Security and Protocol Updates
A new security report for U16a was added to the documentation, enhancing transparency and trust. Initial implementation of the LivenessModule2 specification was drafted, aligning the codebase with proposed design for improved liveness mechanisms.
- [#17538](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17538)
- [#17272](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17272)

### CI/CD and Acceptance Test Refinements
The acceptance tests were refactored to move network presets directly into the tests, reducing reliance on the `config.yaml` and making the CI configuration more streamlined. Support for Cannon+Kona games was also added to the `OPContractsManager` behind a dev feature toggle.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Integration and Registry
The issue tracking the integration of the Superchain Registry for interop-enabled networks has been closed. This work ensures that production-style configurations are used in devnets, with a sub-issue for proofs team also being tracked.
- [#15847](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15847)

### Codebase Standardization
The effort to create a single source of truth for address structs across `op-deployer` and `op-chain-ops` has been completed and the issue closed. This addresses redundancy and improves consistency within the codebase.
- [#14977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14977)

### CI/CD and Testing Infrastructure
The issue related to adding a nightly CI job for `op-sync-tester` to sync using the latest `op-node` has been closed, indicating successful implementation of this testing mechanism.
- [#17253](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17253)

### Dependency Updates
The issue concerning the update of `optimism-package` to support Fusaka on L1 has been closed, indicating the necessary dependency bumps have been completed.
- [#17521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17521)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Network Upgrade Transaction Conventions
Discussion continues on [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/781) regarding enshrining new conventions for Network Upgrade Transactions that deploy new contracts. The latest comment from @protolambda provides a detailed analysis of address collision resistance for `CREATE`, `CREATE2`, and upgrade source-hashes, noting that the start of the keccak preimage always differs, preventing collisions. A suggestion was made to use the `CREATE2` computation with a system address as the deployer and the source-hash as salt for extra safety, fitting within existing address computation frameworks and preventing user collisions.
