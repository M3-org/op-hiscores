# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Aug 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw new pull requests focused on code simplification and removal of an event system component. Several new issues were opened, including a potential `op-devstack` host issue, a request to revise `op-acceptance-tests`, and a new task for the DA Footprint Limit specification. Discussions continued on supporting Go 1.24 in Cannon and the future of the `op-service` event system.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Code Simplification and Refactoring
Efforts are underway to streamline the codebase, with a new pull request aiming to simplify code within `op-service`. This indicates a focus on improving maintainability and readability.
- [#17085](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17085)

### Event System Refinement
A pull request was opened to remove `StepEvent` from `op-node`, suggesting a move towards a more refined or potentially redesigned event handling mechanism within the system.
- [#17097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17097)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened:
- [#17085](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17085) `op-service: simplify code` aims to reduce complexity in the `op-service` component.
- [#17097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17097) `op-node: Remove StepEvent` proposes the removal of a specific event type from `op-node`.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed on this day.

## NEW ISSUES
### Development Environment and Testing Issues
A potential issue with the default host in `op-devstack` was reported, leading to consistent errors in `sysgo` tests for a Base user. Additionally, a new issue was opened to revise the `safedb EL sync` tests within `op-acceptance-tests`.
- [#17082](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17082)
- [#17083](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17083)

### Data Availability and Cannon Support
A new task was created to write the specification for the DA Footprint Limit. Furthermore, an issue was opened to track the necessary changes to support the release of Cannon with Go 1.24, including updates to OPCM and `op-deployer`.
- [#17087](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17087)
- [#17095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17095)

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Cannon Go 1.24 Support
Issue [#14760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14760) was reopened by pauldowman, who noted that this tracker issue will remain open until the Go 1.24 support for Cannon is shipped. A sub-issue for OPCM changes will also be added.

### Event System Refactoring in op-service
Discussion on [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16874) regarding `op-service: Event Call Graph` continued. pcw109550 commented that while sashass1315's contribution was appreciated, the team is leaning towards removing the entire event system, meaning the proposed changes would not be merged. The existing code might still be used to follow control flow during the event system's removal.

### DA Footprint Limit Design
On [#17009](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17009), mslipper provided an update, linking to the design document for the DA Footprint Limit.
