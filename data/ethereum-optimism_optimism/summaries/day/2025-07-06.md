# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing test infrastructure. Key activities included re-enabling a critical fault proofs test in CI and refining acceptance tests by removing debug print statements, contributing to a more robust and production-ready testing environment.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Test Infrastructure Improvements
Efforts were made to strengthen the project's testing suite. A previously disabled `op-e2e/faultproofs` test was re-enabled in CI, ensuring comprehensive coverage for the dispute game ([#16398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16398)). Additionally, print statements were removed from `op-acceptance-tests` to prepare them for execution on live networks, improving test cleanliness and efficiency ([#16602](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16602)).
