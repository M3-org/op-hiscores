# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the dispute monitoring system to check output roots against multiple rollup nodes and refining contract interfaces by removing duplicated structs.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dispute Monitoring Enhancements
The dispute monitoring system (`op-dispute-mon`) was updated to allow checking output roots against multiple rollup nodes, improving the robustness of the monitoring process. This change aligns with the goal of enhancing protocol security and decentralization. ([#16490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16490))

### Contract Refinements
A duplicated struct within the `contracts-bedrock` interfaces was removed, streamlining the codebase and improving maintainability. This contributes to overall code quality and efficiency. ([#16621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16621))
