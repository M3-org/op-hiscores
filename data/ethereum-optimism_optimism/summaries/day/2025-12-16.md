# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a significant feature addition to OPCMv2, enhancing upgrade ordering checks. Several new pull requests were opened focusing on pipeline metrics, comment accuracy, and challenger improvements. New issues were raised concerning blob tip oracle activation, proposer simplification, and proof action testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Upgrade Ordering for OPCMv2
A new feature was added to OPCMv2 to ensure proper ordering for chain upgrades, improving protocol security and stability. This involved modifications to core contract interfaces and utilities.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Feature Development and Metrics:** A new pull request, [#18623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18623) "Feat/pipeline metrics", was opened, likely focusing on adding metrics to development pipelines.
- **Code Quality and Documentation:** [#18622](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18622) "chore: improve comments accuracy (#741)" aims to enhance the clarity and accuracy of code comments.
- **Challenger Improvements:** Two pull requests address the `op-challenger`: [#18619](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18619) "challenger: Fix kona-interop host args" and [#18617](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18617) "op-challenger: PoC for super node trace provider", indicating ongoing work to refine its functionality and support for supernodes.

## CLOSED ISSUES

## NEW ISSUES

### Protocol Enhancements and Simplification
- [#18618](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18618) "follow-up issue to activate blob tip oracle" tracks the activation of the blob tip oracle.
- [#18620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18620) "proposer: Remove l2oo support" proposes simplifying the `op-proposer` logic by removing support for the L2OutputOracle.

### Proofs and Supernode Testing
- [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18621) "SPIKE: Rework Proofs Action Testing to Support Supernodes" identifies a need to re-evaluate and adapt current action testing for proofs to be compatible with the Supernode architecture.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona-SP1 Optimization for ZK Proofs
Issue [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18533) "kona-sp1: Ensure expensive operations are offloaded to the host" discusses optimizing `kona-sp1` for ZK Proofs by offloading expensive operations like keccak and sha2 to the host. The latest comment from @lnphi clarifies a username confusion and acknowledges the ongoing work, while @rdin777 previously inquired about the progress in identifying all areas requiring offloading and other potentially expensive operations.

### Interoperability and Replacement Transactions
Issue [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574) "interop: evaluate and rework injected replacement Tx" focuses on the mechanism of injected replacement transactions for invalid interop transactions. The latest comment from @rdin777 summarizes a consensus to simplify the protocol by eliminating the additional deposit transaction for proofs, suggesting architectural refactoring and an update to the Interop specification. @Inphi and @axelKingsley previously discussed the necessity of the additional transaction for proofs versus the Supernode's ability to generate needed data, with @ajsutton emphasizing its criticality for the proofs system and gas limit considerations.

### Node Synchronization Issues
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581) "the node is not synchronized" addresses problems with node synchronization, often indicated by "missing trie node" errors. The latest comment from @yaki-1337 asks for guidance on downloading snapshots with the latest blocks, following @rdin777's request for detailed environment information (client configurations, full logs, and flags) to diagnose the issue. Previous comments from @tsulhc and @bayardar also highlight similar synchronization problems with `op-geth` and publicnode snapshots.
