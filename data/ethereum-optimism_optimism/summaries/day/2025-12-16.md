# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 16, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the OP Stack's upgrade mechanisms with a new feature for ordered upgrades in OPCMv2, alongside active discussions on critical issues like node synchronization and interop transaction handling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Protocol Upgrade Safety
A new feature has been added to the OP Contracts Manager V2 (OPCMv2) to enforce proper ordering for chain upgrades. This ensures a more secure and predictable upgrade path for the Superchain ecosystem. ([#18583](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18583))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Pipeline Metrics & Challenger Enhancements**: New pull requests include adding pipeline metrics ([#18623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18623)), improving comment accuracy ([#18622](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18622)), fixing host arguments for the challenger's kona-interop ([#18619](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18619)), and a Proof of Concept for a super node trace provider in the op-challenger ([#18617](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18617)).

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Protocol Simplification and Optimization
- **Blob Tip Oracle Activation**: A follow-up issue has been created to address all `TODO(18618)` markers related to activating the blob tip oracle ([#18618](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18618)).
- **Proposer L2OutputOracle Removal**: An issue proposes removing L2OutputOracle support from the op-proposer to simplify its logic, as it's no longer supported by the OP Stack ([#18620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18620)).

### Testing Infrastructure Improvements
- **Proofs Action Testing Rework**: A spike has been initiated to rework Proofs Action Testing to better support the Supernode architecture, aiming to simplify the migration of proofs tests ([#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18621)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Node Synchronization and Execution Client Issues
Discussion on [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581) (the node is not synchronized) continues with users reporting "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. The latest comments from @yaki-1337 indicate using a full node without an archive, no improper shutdowns, and OP-GETH. They are seeking guidance on where to download OP-GETH or if switching to Reth is advisable. @rdin777 provided troubleshooting steps, suggesting the error points to an incomplete or corrupted state database and asking for clarification on node type, shutdown history, and execution client.

### Interoperability and Replacement Transaction Evaluation
Issue [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574) (interop: evaluate and rework injected replacement Tx) is actively being discussed. The latest comments from @ajsutton highlight two downsides of the super node just recording data: lack of consensus-based accuracy checks and data availability issues if derivation isn't run locally. They note these are not showstoppers for the current system but become less concerning with ZK proofs, where derivation would always be re-run. @rdin777 summarized a consensus to simplify the protocol by eliminating the additional deposit transaction for proofs and requested architectural refactoring and an update to the Interop specification. @Inphi agreed that the Supernode should be able to generate necessary proof data, supporting protocol simplification. @axelKingsley questioned why the original block hash couldn't be supplied by the Supernode, treating its recorded denylists as a "SafeDB for replacements." @ajsutton previously emphasized the criticality of the additional transaction for the proofs system to prevent overwhelming honest challengers and dismissed concerns about exceeding block gas limits.

### Kona-SP1 Optimization for ZK Proofs
The discussion on [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18533) (kona-sp1: Ensure expensive operations are offloaded to the host) revolves around optimizing cryptographic operations for the SP1 zkVM. @lnphi received a notification for this issue, clarifying a username confusion. Previously, @rdin777 inquired about the progress in identifying all areas where keccak and sha2 are performed outside the EVM and if other computationally expensive operations might require similar offloading.
