# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining core components, with significant refactoring in `op-batcher` for improved code quality and critical bug fixes addressing CI stability and test timeouts. Progress was also made in transitioning acceptance tests away from fast games.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Batcher Refactoring and Test Stability
The `op-batcher` saw substantial code refactoring, removing dead code and streamlining the `channel` and `ChannelBuilder` components without altering behavior ([#18174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18174)). Additionally, test stability was improved by increasing timeouts for `cliRunner` tests to address flakiness ([#18179](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18179)).

### Acceptance Test Enhancements and CI Fixes
Acceptance tests were updated to replace fast games with regular FaultDisputeGames, simplifying `op-deployer` and OPCM ([#18152](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18152)). A critical CI issue related to a missing Slack token context was also resolved ([#18156](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18156)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A significant number of new pull requests were opened, primarily focusing on documentation enhancements across various sections (e.g., [#18171](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18171), [#18170](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18170), [#18169](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18169), [#18168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18168), [#18167](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18167), [#18166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18166), [#18165](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18165), [#18164](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18164), [#18163](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18163), [#18162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18162), [#18161](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18161), [#18160](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18160), [#18159](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18159), [#18158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18158), [#18157](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18157)). Other notable PRs include an update for Superroot API Activity ([#18180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18180)), test fixes after preimageOracle removal ([#18176](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18176)), and preparations for Kona prestate verification ([#18175](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18175)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dependency and Migration Updates
The long-standing issue regarding a broken dependency in `op-chain-ops` related to `github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39` was closed, having been fixed by a previous pull request ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16612)). Additionally, the issue tracking updates to the `migrate` method, specifically for OPCM changes, was closed as the relevant updates were completed ([#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17743)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Batcher Synchronization and Feature Toggle Removal
A new issue highlights a potential problem with `op-batcher` not staying in sync with `op-node` rollup configuration after initial startup, which could lead to brittle behavior ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18178)). Another issue proposes the removal of feature toggles for Kona and Cannon, with a decision needed on whether this can occur after an audit ([#18181](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18181)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher Rollup Config Synchronization ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18178))
Discussion revolves around the `op-batcher`'s current behavior of only fetching the rollup config once at startup, making it vulnerable to out-of-date configurations. One suggestion is to make the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher to clarify dependencies. Another approach proposed is to integrate with the active endpoint provider to signal changes, triggering a reload of the rollup config, as relying on error handling for outdated configs could be brittle.
