# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining core components, with significant refactoring in the `op-batcher`, bug fixes for flaky tests and CI, and updates to acceptance tests to remove fast games. Several documentation enhancements were also initiated.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-batcher` Refactoring and Optimization
The `op-batcher` saw significant internal refactoring, removing dead code and streamlining the `channel` and `ChannelBuilder` components without altering existing behavior. This effort aims to improve code maintainability and clarity.
- Refactoring `op-batcher` components ([#18174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18174))

### Test Stability and CI Improvements
Efforts were made to enhance the stability of integration tests and the continuous integration pipeline. This included increasing test timeouts to address flakiness and ensuring proper token context for CI jobs.
- Increasing `cliRunner` test timeouts ([#18179](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18179))
- Fixing CI Slack token context ([#18156](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18156))

### Acceptance Test Modernization
The acceptance test suite was updated to replace "fast games" with regular FaultDisputeGames, simplifying `op-deployer` and OPCM by removing support for older testing mechanisms.
- Replacing fast games with regular FDGs in acceptance tests ([#18152](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18152))

### Contract Management Enhancements
The contract loading mechanism was improved to dynamically load CANNON game implementations from the DisputeGameFactory, reducing reliance on static artifacts.
- Loading CANNON game implementation from DisputeGameFactory ([#18155](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18155))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dependency Resolution and Migration Updates
Two issues related to dependency management and migration processes were closed today, indicating progress in updating and maintaining the codebase.
- `op-chain-ops`: broken dependency `github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39` ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16612))
- Update `migrate` method ([#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17743))

### `ForkLive.s.sol` Update
An issue tracking the update of `ForkLive.s.sol` was closed, with previous work partially addressing the problem and remaining tasks focused on deployment output visibility.
- Update `ForkLive.s.sol` ([#17741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17741))

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-batcher` Rollup Config Synchronization
A new issue highlights a potential brittleness in the `op-batcher`'s rollup configuration, as it only fetches the config once at startup. This could lead to inconsistencies if the `op-node`'s rollup config changes.
- `op-batcher`: stay in sync with `op-node` rollup config ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18178))

### Kona + Cannon Feature Toggle Removal
An issue was opened to track the removal of feature toggles for Kona and Cannon, with a decision needed on whether this can occur after the audit.
- Kona + Cannon: remove feature toggles ([#18181](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18181))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-batcher` Rollup Config Synchronization ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18178))
Discussions revolve around the `op-batcher`'s current method of fetching the rollup config only once at startup, which is deemed brittle. Solutions proposed include making the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher, or having the active endpoint provider signal changes to trigger a reload. The trade-off for the latter is the need for a new batcher release for each Superchain Registry config change if not explicitly provided.
