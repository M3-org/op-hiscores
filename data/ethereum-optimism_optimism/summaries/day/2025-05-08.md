## CLOSED ISSUES

**Creator Pattern Consolidation**
The issue [#13168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13168) related to implementing the new Creator Pattern was closed. This closure is due to the consolidation of all related sub-issues under a main parent issue, [#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421).

## NEW ISSUES

**Fault Proof System Enhancements**
A new issue, [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15789), was opened to investigate and address the necessary OPCM (Optimism Protocol Compatibility Module) changes required for the Fault Proof creator contract, ensuring compatibility with recent updates.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes**
The issue [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15789) was opened to address the OPCM changes for the Fault Proof creator contract. While the issue was created on May 8, 2025, subsequent comments indicate ongoing work and a detailed plan for resolution. A comment from stevennevins on July 9, 2025, outlines a comprehensive checklist of tasks, including moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, removing `anchorStateRegistry` from `StandardValidatorOverrides`, unskipping and updating tests in `DeployOPChain.t.sol`, reviewing comments, addressing TODOs, rebasing updates from EVM safety, and fixing Go updates in integration tests. An earlier comment from stevennevins on June 10, 2025, links to a pull request, https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16340, which is likely related to the progress on this issue.
