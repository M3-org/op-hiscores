# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant updates to the `op-deployer` and `op-validator` tools, including an upgrade to v6.0.0 and the addition of new validation tests. There was also a notable effort in test maintenance, specifically skipping redundant AI-generated tests.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-deployer` and `op-validator` Upgrade
The `op-deployer` and `op-validator` tools received a substantial upgrade to version 6.0.0. This feature includes copying over the embedded upgrade for `op-deployer` and integrating `op-validator` v6.0.0 with new tests to ensure its functionality.
- feat(op-deployer): op-validator and upgrade to v600 ([#18662](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18662))

### Test Maintenance and Optimization
An AI-generated test for `StandardBridge.t.sol` was skipped due to existing comprehensive coverage, streamlining the testing process.
- chore(ai-test): skip test/universal/StandardBridge.t.sol - already has comprehensive coverage ([#18671](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18671))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A variety of new pull requests were opened, including several dependency updates for Go modules such as `golang.org/x/crypto`, `github.com/docker/docker`, `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace`, and `golang.org/x/mod` ([#18683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18683), [#18682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18682), [#18681](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18681), [#18680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18680)). Other notable PRs include a rule for immutable variables in `OPContractsManagerV2` ([#18679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18679)), a migration of Docker builds to GitHub Actions ([#18678](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18678)), a new feature for `DelegatedDisputeGame` ([#18677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18677)), removal of asterisc support in `op-challenger/op-dispute-mon` ([#18670](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18670)), integration of a super node trace provider in `op-challenger` ([#18668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18668)), and a cherry-pick for the `op-deployer` and `op-validator` upgrade ([#18686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18686)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-node` Light CL Implementation
The `op-node`'s implementation of Light CL, specifically the "Follow External Source" feature, has been completed. This allows the `op-node` to mirror external safe/finalized feeds using the `--l2.follow.source` flag.
- [M2] op-node: Light CL: Follow External Source ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18317))

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-contracts` Deployment Boundary Bug
A critical bug has been identified in `op-contracts` where deployment fails on fresh EVM environments due to the 24KB contract size limit, although this is masked on Mainnet and Sepolia by pre-deployed contracts.
- op-contracts: Blueprint Deployment Boundary Bug ([#18685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18685))

### `op-challenger` and `vm-runner` Updates
There is a new issue to update the `vm-runner` to utilize the super node instead of the supervisor, which will simplify maintenance as supervisor support was never released. This will likely require a `syncStatus` API.
- op-challenger: Update vm-runner to use super node ([#18669](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18669))

### `kona-node` and `op-devstack` Sync and Testing Challenges
Several issues have been raised regarding the `kona-node` and `op-devstack`, including the need for a Light CL implementation in `kona-node` ([#18672](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18672)), incorrect `current_l1` selection in `optimism_syncStatus` ([#18673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18673)), and problems with sequencer detection and testing within `op-devstack` and `kona` ([#18674](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18674), [#18675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18675)). Additionally, there's a need to check L2 reorgs due to L1 reorgs in `kona` ([#18676](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18676)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-challenger`: Review correct trace output when next super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18643))
Discussion on this issue confirms that the super node trace provider now correctly handles cases where the next super root is not found. While the `op-supervisor` will not be fixed as it's being deprecated, the issue remains open until an integration test verifies `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. There was an initial concern about the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test's correctness, and the behavior of `op-supervisor`'s superroot RPC regarding local-safe blocks was clarified.
