# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, fixing critical bugs in the `op-deployer` and CI, and streamlining contract deployment processes by removing legacy code. Significant progress was made in improving test coverage and reliability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing and CI Reliability
Improvements were made to the CI pipeline, including a fix for the `op-e2e-fuzz` job's dependency on `cannon-prestate` ([#18041](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18041)). Go tests were moved to regular runners for better performance ([#18032](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18032)), and `op-acceptance-tests` were de-flaked to address asynchronous EL syncing issues ([#18029](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18029)). Test coverage for `BaseFeeVault` was also improved ([#17996](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17996)).

### `op-deployer` Bug Fixes and Refinements
A critical error handling bug in `op-deployer`'s `add_game_type` CLI parsing was resolved, preventing erroneous exits ([#18026](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18026)). Additionally, the `op-deployer` was updated to use production contract bindings for fetching VM in `DisputeGameFactoryHelper` ([#18025](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18025)).

### Legacy Contract Code Removal
Efforts continued to streamline the codebase by removing outdated contract deployment scripts. This included the removal of `DeployDisputeGame.s.sol` ([#18002](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18002)) and `DeployAuthSystem.s.sol` ([#18033](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18033)), transitioning to newer, more efficient formats.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Enhanced `op-deployer` Testing
The issue [#16842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16842), which aimed for more end-to-end testing in `op-deployer`, was closed. This was due to the recent introduction of many new CLI-level integration tests, addressing the need for improved test coverage.

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-deployer` Migration to V2 Deployment Scripts
Several new issues were opened to complete the migration of `op-deployer` to V2 deployment scripts, following the "strangler fig" strategy:
*   [#18034](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18034) tracks the migration to `DeployMIPS2.s.sol`.
*   [#18035](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18035) focuses on migrating to `DeployProxy2.s.sol`.
*   [#18036](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18036) addresses the migration to `DeployPreimageOracle2.s.sol`.

### Feature Request for Test Dashboards
A new feature request, [#18039](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18039), was opened to preconfigure dashboards for `sysgo` metrics, aiming to improve test observability.
