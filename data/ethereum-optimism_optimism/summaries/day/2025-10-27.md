# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 27, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, fixing critical bugs in deployment tools, and streamlining contract management. Significant efforts were made to improve test coverage and reliability, alongside removing legacy contract deployment scripts.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing and CI/CD Reliability
*   Improved `BaseFeeVault` test coverage and naming consistency [#17996](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17996).
*   Migrated Go tests to regular runners for improved performance and efficiency [#18032](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18032).
*   Addressed flakiness in `TestL2ELP2PCanonicalChainAdvancedByFCU` within acceptance tests [#18029](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18029).
*   Fixed a CI issue related to `op-e2e-fuzz` job dependency on `cannon-prestate` [#18041](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18041).

### Deployment Tooling Improvements and Bug Fixes
*   Corrected error handling in `op-deployer`'s `add_game_type` CLI parsing, resolving an issue where it exited with an error message when no error occurred [#18026](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18026).
*   Removed the legacy `DeployDisputeGame.s.sol` script from `op-deployer` following refactoring [#18002](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18002).
*   Removed abandoned `DeployAuthSystem.s.sol` code from `op-contracts` [#18033](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18033).
*   Updated `DisputeGameFactoryHelper` in `op-e2e` to use production contract bindings for VM fetching, supporting V1 and V2 contracts [#18025](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18025).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#18043](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18043) adds a u17 audit report.
*   [#18042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18042) proposes new accelerated precompile input limits for Jovian in `op-program`.
*   [#18040](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18040) introduces a standard versions generation script.
*   [#18038](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18038) updates the version of foundry tooling to v1.2.3.
*   [#18037](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18037) focuses on flake-shake and test promotions for `op-acceptance-tests`.
*   [#18031](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18031) adds a test to the base gate for unsafe gossip / head progression in `op-acceptance-tests`.
*   [#18028](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18028) enhances `L2ToL1MessagePasser` test coverage and organization.
*   [#18027](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18027) adds flags for new v2 dispute game implementations options in `op-deployer`.
*   [#18024](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18024) enables `op-deployer` to support working with V2 fault dispute game contracts.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-deployer` End-to-End Testing
*   The issue [#16842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16842) concerning the need for more end-to-end testing in `op-deployer` has been closed. This was due to the recent introduction of many new CLI-level integration tests, addressing the initial concern.

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-deployer` Migration to V2 Deployment Scripts
*   Migration to `DeployMIPS2.s.sol`: [#18034](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18034) outlines the need to remove the legacy `DeployMIPS.s.sol` and fully adopt the new `DeployMIPS2.s.sol` format.
*   Migration to `DeployProxy2.s.sol`: [#18035](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18035) proposes removing `DeployProxy.s.sol` in favor of `DeployProxy2.s.sol`.
*   Migration to `DeployPreimageOracle2.s.sol`: [#18036](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18036) suggests replacing `DeployPreimageOracle.s.sol` with `DeployPreimageOracle2.s.sol`.

### Testing and Metrics
*   Preconfigure dashboards for sysgo metrics: [#18039](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18039) requests a feature to preconfigure dashboards for system Go metrics.
