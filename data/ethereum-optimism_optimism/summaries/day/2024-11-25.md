## NEW ISSUES
### op-challenger Performance Optimization
A new issue was opened to address the `op-challenger`'s frequent calls to the L1 node and its processing of games. The issue proposes adding an option to limit how often games are processed to reduce the load on the L1 node, as `op-challenger` currently tracks all games from the last 28 days and loads all claims for each game, leading to excessive calls.
