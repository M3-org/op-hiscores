# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes for Superchain configuration upgrades, enhancements to the `op-challenger` for Kona support, and significant refactoring in `op-e2e` for improved testing. New features included README updates and the introduction of `PermissionedDisputeGameV2`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Configuration & Contract Upgrades
Significant work was done to address and fix a bug related to `superchainConfig` upgrades, ensuring proper version comparison and supporting multiple configurations. This involved separating upgrade logic and introducing a new `SemverComp` library for robust version handling. Additionally, a new `PermissionedDisputeGameV2` was introduced to support migrating chain-specific configurations.

- [#17368](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17368)
- [#17290](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17290)

### `op-challenger` and Kona Support Enhancements
The `op-challenger` received updates to fix metric label names for `asterisc-kona` deployments and gained support for `cannon-kona` trace functionality. This includes adding `CANNON_KONA` and `SUPER_ASTERISC_KONA` game types to contracts to maintain synchronization with the Go implementation.

- [#17358](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17358)

### Developer Tooling and Documentation Improvements
The `README.md` was updated to reflect the current directory structure, including newly added directories. The `op-e2e` testing framework was refactored to use the `ActivateForkAtOffset` utility, simplifying future fork activation tests. Documentation for `op-e2e/system` also received a deprecation notice.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#17373](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17373), was opened by Dependabot to bump the `golang.org/x/sync` dependency from version 0.14.0 to 0.17.0.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Throttling Metric Improvement
The issue [#17149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17149) regarding improving the `op-batcher`'s throttling intensity metric was closed. The proposed solution involves only setting the metric value for the active controller, making it easier to visualize in Grafana.

### Large Genesis File Initialization
Issue [#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/668), concerning `op-geth` init with large genesis files and a LevelDB panic, was closed. The discussion highlighted that the large genesis state spec is optional and can be omitted during initialization, with the state hash included in the chain config for snap-syncing.

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-deployer` Deployment on Alt L1
A new issue, [#17365](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17365), was opened regarding the `op-deployer` not deploying `OPChain` on alternative L1s (non-standard chains). This suggests a potential limitation or bug in the deployment process for non-mainnet environments.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis: Local `op-geth` Build
Issue [#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16975) discusses the desire for Kurtosis to use local `op-geth` builds. The latest comment suggests leveraging the templating system to automatically override the `op-geth` image. This could involve resolving to a Docker image URL constructed from the `go.mod` githash or building a local Docker image from cloned source code. The goal is to enable developers to test with their local `op-geth` changes more easily.
