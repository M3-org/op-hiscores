# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant upgrades to the Optimism Protocol Contracts Manager (OPCM) for U17, alongside critical op-node improvements for L1 genesis hash checks and an op-geth bump for Superchain registry configuration. Several long-standing issues related to devnet spinup, Isthmus withdrawals, and test retries were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Protocol Contracts Manager (OPCM) Upgrade for U17
A major feature was added to set up the OPCM for U17, removing U16 code and updating it for the new version. This enhancement also improves the OPCM's maintainability for future developers. ([#17406](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17406))

### Op-Node Stability and Configuration Updates
The op-node now skips L1 genesis hash checks if the block is unavailable from the L1, addressing issues with pruned block and receipt data on L1 nodes. Additionally, op-geth was bumped to include new Superchain registry configurations for the arena-z-sepolia isthmus hardfork. ([#17407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17407), [#17437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17437))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#17439](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17439) op-batcher: throttle config overhaul (pending-DA defaults, always-limit, step alignment)
- [#17442](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17442) feat(kurtosis-devner): guard concurrent writes to build output buffer

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Devnet and Testing Infrastructure Improvements
Several issues related to development and testing infrastructure were closed. This includes the completion of a script for permissionless devnet spinup ([#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/346)), and the closure of issues concerning Isthmus withdrawals root Action Tests ([#168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/168)), test retries ([#188](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/188)), and returning test stdout & stderr ([#198](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/198)).

### Geth Merge and Related Bug Fixes
The issue tracking the completion of the Geth v1.16.2 merge was closed ([#17223](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17223)).

## NEW ISSUES
- No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Abnormal CPU Usage with op-geth ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/613))
The discussion around abnormal CPU usage with op-geth v1.101511.0 continued, with the latest comment from `cpuchainorg` on 2025-09-12T12:15:48Z suggesting that CPU usage has decreased after the log indexing introduced by Geth 1.15.x finished. Earlier comments from `PierrickGT` and `jsvisa` provided guidance on how to capture pprof metrics to diagnose the issue, with `PierrickGT` noting that the performance issue was likely due to an index update that took about 24 hours. `hekich` also confirmed that CPU usage returned to normal after the index upgrade.

### Receipt Correction: Failed to decode RLP receipts ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/679))
This issue, opened today, reports crashes with "Receipt Correction: Failed to decode RLP receipts" when using op-geth v1.101602.0 and op-node v1.13.6 on op-mainnet during a full sync. `cpuchainorg` provided the initial report and noted that full logs are unavailable due to Geth crashing. `sebastianst` confirmed experiencing the issue during snap-syncing an op-mainnet node and is investigating, also providing a link to a potential fix.
