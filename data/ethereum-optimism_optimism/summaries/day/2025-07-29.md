# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the opening of two new pull requests focusing on Go implementation updates for a creator pattern and initial execution multiplexing. A new issue was opened to explore event call graph tracing, while an active issue regarding congestion-based builder transaction reordering received a new comment.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No completed work was reported for this day.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened today:
- [#16869](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16869) Go implementation updates for CWIA creator pattern.
- [#16873](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16873) op-node, op-devstack: initial execution multiplexing.

## CLOSED ISSUES

No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES

### Event System Tracing
A new issue, [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16874), was opened to add logic for tracing the event flow within `op-service`, aiming to visualize call traces for events like `p2p.ReceivedBlockEvent`. This issue was later closed on August 25, 2025, as similar functionality was found in another pull request.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Congestion-based Builder Transaction Reordering
The active issue [#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/306), concerning congestion-based builder transaction reordering, received a new comment from @moonfury-ops, who expressed interest in collaborating with @sebastianst on the topic. The issue's body describes the idea of tracking DA usage excess over time with an exponential cost/score penalty, suggesting it could be implemented outside the protocol to test the concept for an L1 congestion cost component.
