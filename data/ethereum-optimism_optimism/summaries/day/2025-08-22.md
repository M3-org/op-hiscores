# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Aug 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on advancing the fault dispute game with a new V2, enhancing the `op-program`'s stability, and significantly bolstering the `op-sync-tester` with new engine APIs and E2E test integration, improving overall system robustness and testability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Fault Dispute Game V2 Implementation
A new version of the fault dispute game, `FaultDisputeGameV2`, was introduced to validate the creator pattern flow. This foundational feature is crucial for future dispute resolution mechanisms.
- [#16929](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16929)

### Enhanced Sync Tester Capabilities and E2E Testing
Significant progress was made in the `op-sync-tester`, adding Verifier Engine APIs for Isthmus, Ecotone, Fjord, Granite, and Holocene. This was complemented by the integration of `SyncTester` into `op-devstack` for initial E2E testing, and improvements to acceptance tests to ensure follower nodes are in sync before test execution.
- [#17072](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17072)
- [#17132](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17132)
- [#17179](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17179)
- [#17181](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17181)

### `op-program` Stability Improvement
A critical bug fix was implemented in `op-program` to ensure proper resource cleanup in `pebbleKV.Get` by moving the `closer.Close()` call to a defer statement, preventing potential resource leaks.
- [#17166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17166)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#17182](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17182): Documentation update to fix a default value related to throttling.
- [#17185](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17185): A fix for address book initialization within `op-devstack`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dispute Game Invalidation
An issue related to creating a U16-compatible `superchain-ops` template to invalidate existing dispute games by updating the retirement timestamp has been closed. This is a key step in the fault proofs recovery runbook.
- [#16827](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16827)

## NEW ISSUES

### Test Flakiness and CI/CD Improvements
Two new issues were opened focusing on improving test reliability and developer experience with the CI/CD pipeline. One addresses flakiness in `TestWrapETH` within acceptance tests, while the other aims to enhance the usability and testability of the CircleCI configuration.
- [#17180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17180)
- [#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17184)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Chain Configuration Validation Testing
Discussions on [#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/686) continue to focus on improving validation tests for chain configurations. The latest comments from @bitwiseguy and @teddyknox (from 2025-09-03) highlight the desire to run high-value monorepo CI jobs locally, particularly `kurtosis` and `go-tests-short`. Key pain points include the manual prerequisite setup for local testing and the lack of local validation for CircleCI config syntax. There's an interesting proposal to dynamically sort Go tests by run time to optimize test job durations, allowing developers to run more tests within their time budget. The idea is to have a script that updates test manifests based on local run durations, which can then be committed to VCS. The discussion also touches on moving complexity into pure functions for easier testing and increasing code coverage.
