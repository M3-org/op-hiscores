## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened:
*   [#16350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16350) chore(deps): bump requests from 2.32.0 to 2.32.4 in /ops/check-changed: This PR updates a dependency.
*   [#16369](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16369) feat: set up U18 OPCM base: This PR introduces a new feature.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed on this date.

## NEW ISSUES
Two new issues were opened:
*   **Contract Assertions Refinement**
    *   [#16362](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16362) Remove redundant assertions outside of the StandardValidator: This issue proposes to centralize all necessary checks within the `StandardValidator` and remove redundant checks from `ChainAssertions.sol` and deploy scripts. A plan was outlined to remove existing checks and then move `ChainAssertions.sol` checks to `StandardValidator`, potentially using a child contract if codesize limits are exceeded.
*   **Supervisor Rewinder Review**
    *   [#16355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16355) op-supervisor: Revisit rewinder's use of `ChainRewoundEvent`: This issue aims to re-evaluate how the `Rewinder` in `op-supervisor` handles `LocalSafeUpdateEvent` and the emission of `ChainRewoundEvent`.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
*   **Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes**
    *   [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15789) Fault Proof creator contract OPCM changes: The latest comment from stevennevins on July 9, 2025, outlines a detailed plan of action. Key tasks include moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, removing `anchorStateRegistry` from `StandardValidatorOverrides`, unskipping and updating tests in `DeployOPChain.t.sol`, reviewing comment responses, addressing TODO comments, rebasing updates from EVM safety, and fixing Go updates on Go test/integration. A related PR [#16340](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16340) was linked on June 10, 2025.
*   **op-supervisor: Event Overflow on Large Unsafe Head Gap**
    *   [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16335) op-supervisor: Event overflow on large unsafe head gap: Discussions revolve around the supervisor crashing due to an event overflow when the unsafe head gap is too large. On June 10, 2025, axelKingsley clarified that `ChainIndexingContinueEvent`s do not stack up and are a fix to previous behavior, with a 1:1 emit:consume ratio. They noted that while their previous fix eliminated queue-depth issues, other problems in the event system might still exist. Later comments (June 17-19) from sebastianst and nonsense suggest adding gauges for in-flight events and per-event type counters to better diagnose the issue, with a PR [#16473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16473) opened to add a gauge for all in-flight events.
