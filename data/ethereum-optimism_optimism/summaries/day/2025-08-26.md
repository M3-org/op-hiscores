# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Aug 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining testing infrastructure, addressing CI stability, and making minor tooling adjustments. Key updates include an `op-sync-tester` refactor and a CI fix.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Testing Infrastructure Enhancements
The `op-sync-tester` was significantly refactored to implement the `L2ELNode` interface, simplifying network setup for testing. This change streamlines the integration of the sync tester with other components like `op-geth` and `op-reth`. ([#17200](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17200))

### CI/CD and Tooling Improvements
A critical CI issue was resolved by removing a problematic "Todo" that was causing build failures. Additionally, documentation for `op-deployer` was updated to correct an outdated link, and basic CLI argument handling was added to `op-up`. ([#17229](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17229), [#17204](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17204), [#17208](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17208))

### Contract Reversions and CI Stability
A previous change related to FDG legibility was reverted in the U16a proposal branch. Furthermore, a CI adjustment was made to write cannon preimage commit information to a temporary file before uploading, aiming to improve `gsutil cp` retries and reduce flakiness. ([#17209](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17209), [#17219](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17219))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Three new pull requests were opened today:
- [#17221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17221): Focuses on fixing typos within the codebase.
- [#17222](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17222): Introduces a feature to enable flashblocks tests within the Kurtosis devnet.
- [#17227](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17227): Proposes removing the super root migration from the portal as part of the U16a update.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Testing and Development Tooling
The issue of supporting `sysgo` within `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` was closed, indicating progress in integrating these components for testing. Additionally, the `op-up` tool now recognizes and responds to standard CLI flags, improving its usability. ([#16702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16702), [#17076](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17076))

### Challenger Support in `op-up`
The issue concerning `op-up`'s support for the challenger was closed. A comment noted that distributing the challenger in `op-up` for `sysgo` use might be too complex, suggesting a focus on other backends like Docker that don't require binary distribution. ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17005))

## NEW ISSUES

### Core Protocol Development
A new issue was opened to track the completion of the Geth v1.16.2 merge, indicating ongoing efforts to update core dependencies. ([#17223](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17223))

### Security and Auditing
A new issue was created to resolve an ImmuneFi divergence report, highlighting a focus on addressing security findings. ([#17224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17224))

### Developer Experience and Tooling
Two new issues were opened to enhance developer experience: one to define a configuration schema for `op-up` and another to improve the CircleCI config for job dependency references, making CI setup more intuitive. ([#17225](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17225), [#17226](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17226))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-proposer` Transaction Failures ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13502))
The latest comment confirms that setting `--game-type=1` fixed the "Failed to create a transaction" error for a user, suggesting that misconfiguration of the game type is a common cause. Previous discussions highlighted that the error often relates to `NoImplementation` due to misconfigured contracts or an incorrect `game-type` for `op-proposer`.

### Sync Testing with `op-sync-tester` ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16703))
The issue was reopened as not all Hardfork (HF) transitions were tested. New test case ideas include checking every OP Stack HF transition (not just Isthmus), testing multiple CLs with a single Sync Tester, and validating user transactions within L2 blocks. Items 2 and 3 are being tracked in a separate issue.

### Flashblocks Load Testing ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16756))
A comment from today indicates that the issue was accidentally marked as done and that a report summarizing the load test scenarios, networks, and results is currently being worked on.

### Flashblocks Alerting ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16867), [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16868))
For [#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16867) (alert when non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active), a PR for `rollup-boost` is pending, after which the alert will be created. For [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16868) (alert on low peer count health), it was noted that peer count alerting for `op-node` sequencer peering already exists. The plan is to add `reth`/`op-rbuilder` peer count for this specific alert.
