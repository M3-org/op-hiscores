# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 24, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing contract safety checks, integrating AI for test maintenance, and refining custom gas token functionalities. Significant progress was also made in streamlining CI processes and addressing various technical debt issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Smart Contract Enhancements and Safety
Safety checks for the `ETHLockbox` feature in the `setFeature` function were added to the `SystemConfig.sol` contract, improving protocol security. Compiler optimization runs were explicitly set to 0 for the lite profile to reduce compile times. Additionally, Codecov coverage was enabled for MIPS64 contracts, reflecting updated test coverage.
- feat: add safety checks for lockbox in setFeature ([#17559](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17559))
- perf: explictly set compiler runs to 0 to reduce profiles ([#17572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17572))
- codecov: enable coverage for MIPS64 contracts ([#17409](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17409))

### AI-Powered Test Maintenance and CI Improvements
The AI Contract Test Maintenance System was expanded with Devin API integration, enabling automated test improvement workflows. Concurrently, Kurtosis-based CI acceptance tests were removed due to deprecation, streamlining the CI pipeline.
- feat(ai-contracts-test): add devin API integration ([#17602](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17602))
- chore(op-acceptance-tests): ci; remove kurtosis jobs. ([#17581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17581))

### Custom Gas Token Refinements
Review comments for the custom gas token rebase were addressed, leading to fixes across acceptance tests, deployer configurations, and e2e utilities, ensuring robust functionality.
- fix: custom gas token rebase review comments ([#17577](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17577))
