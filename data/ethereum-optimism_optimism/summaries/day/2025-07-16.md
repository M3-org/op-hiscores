# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Jul 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure with new sysgo support and improved SuperchainConfig test coverage, alongside migrating Cannon memory reservation tests. Several long-standing issues were closed, streamlining the project backlog.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
Significant progress was made in bolstering the project's testing capabilities. New in-memory (sysgo) tests were added to CI and local environments, improving the efficiency and scope of testing for `op-acceptance-tests` ([#16550](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16550)). Additionally, the `SuperchainConfig` test suite saw a substantial increase in coverage and quality, notably being the first PR created entirely with AI assistance ([#16675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16675)).

### Cannon Test Framework Migration
Memory reservation-related tests within the Cannon project were migrated to utilize the new DiffTester framework, streamlining the testing process for `mipsevm` components ([#16709](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16709)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Streamlining Configuration and Release Processes
Several issues related to project configuration and release workflows were closed. This includes discussions around a PR-based release workflow ([#12683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12683)) and the replacement of Makefiles with Justfiles for improved monorepo setup ([#12686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12686)). An issue regarding an outdated NPM package for `contracts-bedrock` was also closed, with a note that NPM packages are no longer being updated ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13459)).

### Addressing Sequencer Stability and Recovery
Issues concerning sequencer stability and recovery mechanisms were resolved. This includes the recovery from sequence window expiration incidents, with "recover mode" already implemented ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/11228)). An issue where the sequencer was halting on temporary errors was also closed, with a request to reopen if the problem persists ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12240)).

### Node Startup and Operation
A problem preventing new nodes from starting with `op-node` was closed, with the assumption that it was resolved and a request to reopen if the issue reoccurs ([#15411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15411)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Optimism Portal Contract Manager (OPCM) Upgrade Input Refinement
Two new issues were opened regarding the `OpChainConfig` struct used as input for the `OPCM.upgrade()` function. Both issues propose removing the `proxyAdmin` field from this struct, as it is no longer required and can be derived from `systemConfigProxy.proxyAdmin()` ([#16728](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16728), [#16729](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16729)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Porting TestChainFork to Devstack
The discussion on [#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/413) regarding porting `TestChainFork` to devstack saw recent activity. A comment from `scharissis` questioned if this issue is a duplicate of `infra/issues/367` and suggested closing one of them. Previously, `serpixel` noted that the issue was implemented in [#16594](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16594).
