# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant feature enabling custom gas tokens for OP Stack chains, alongside CI/CD improvements and critical bug fixes. Several new issues were opened concerning Base Mainnet performance and RPC stability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Custom Gas Token Integration
A major feature was introduced to allow OP Stack chains to utilize assets other than ETH as their native fee currency. This involved extensive modifications across acceptance tests, chain operations, deployer configurations, and bedrock contracts. ([#18076](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18076))

### CI/CD and Testing Enhancements
Improvements were made to the CI/CD pipeline, including updating heavy fuzz tests to incorporate dev feature matrices and allocating more resources to `op-e2e-cannon-tests` to prevent resource limits from killing jobs. A bug fix was also implemented to skip validation for missing test artifacts. ([#18368](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18368), [#18359](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18359), [#18367](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18367))

### Safe Contracts Updates
All Safe directory changes from the `develop` branch were cherry-picked to the `op-safe-contracts/v1.0.0` branch, ensuring the v1.0.0 branch reflects the latest improvements. ([#18371](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18371))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Feature Development:** A new PR aims to add support for Blockscout in VerifyOPCM ([#18373](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18373)). Another PR proposes a light CL follow source for `op-node` ([#18365](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18365)).
- **Bug Fixes and Testing:** A fix is proposed to validate interfaces and libraries in test artifact checking ([#18370](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18370)). A PR addresses a potential panic in `op-daployer` by guarding `L1()` against a nil state ([#18361](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18361)). Additionally, a PR focuses on adding `AddressAliasHelper` coverage and fixing a flaky `SystemConfig` test ([#18360](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18360)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fault Proof System Documentation
An issue related to updating OP Labs runbooks for the procedure to switch to Kona + Cannon as a fault proof was closed, indicating progress in documenting the fault proof system. ([#17287](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17287))

### `op-reth` Integration in Acceptance Tests
The issue tracking the re-addition of `op-reth` to the Jovian Kurtosis devnet for `op-acceptance-test` was closed, with confirmation that `op-reth` is now integrated into the acceptance tests within `op-rs/kona`. ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17475))

## NEW ISSUES

### Base Mainnet Performance and RPC Stability
Several new issues highlight concerns regarding Base Mainnet performance. These include intermittent timeouts for `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_sendTransaction` during high gas price periods ([#18362](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18362)), and L2 RPC request failures with custom Base Sequencer configurations ([#18364](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18364)).

### Gas Price Prediction and Batch Submission
A feature request was opened for a Base Mainnet gas price prediction API endpoint to improve dApp user experience ([#18363](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18363)). Additionally, a bug was reported concerning `op-batcher` delays during high transaction volume on Base Mainnet, leading to increased L1 gas costs and delayed finality ([#18366](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18366)).

### Proofs System Runbook Routing
A new issue was created to document a clear process for identifying the correct runbook for any given proofs deployment based on on-chain information ([#18372](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18372)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Docker Image References in Documentation ([#1657](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1657))
The issue concerns incorrect Docker image references on the `node-operators/releases` page. A community member, yasnazariel, has expressed interest in working on this issue.

### Missing Environment Variable Documentation ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1874))
This issue points out that environment variable descriptions corresponding to flags for `op-node` and `op-geth` are no longer available in the documentation. yasnazariel has also volunteered to address this issue.
