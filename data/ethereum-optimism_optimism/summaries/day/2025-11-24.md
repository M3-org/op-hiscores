# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing OP Stack flexibility with custom gas tokens, improving CI/CD robustness, and addressing critical issues related to Base Mainnet performance and fault proof systems.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### OP Stack Flexibility and Custom Gas Tokens
Significant progress was made in enabling OP Stack chains to utilize assets other than ETH as their native fee currency. This involved extensive modifications across acceptance tests, chain operations, deployer configurations, and bedrock contracts to support a minimal, flexible, and standardizable Custom Gas Token (CGT) implementation. This feature enhances the versatility of the Superchain ecosystem.
- [#18076](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18076)

### CI/CD and Testing Infrastructure Improvements
Efforts were directed towards strengthening the continuous integration and deployment pipeline. This included updating heavy fuzz tests to incorporate the dev feature matrix for more comprehensive testing and increasing resource allocation for `op-e2e-cannon-tests` to prevent job failures due to resource limits. A fix was also implemented to skip validation for missing test artifacts, improving CI stability.

- [#18359](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18359)
- [#18367](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18367)

### Safe Contracts and Release Binary Provider Updates
Maintenance and improvements were made to the Safe contracts, with cherry-picked changes from the `develop` branch ensuring the `v1.0.0` branch reflects the latest enhancements. Additionally, the GitHub release binary provider was updated with version checks and a static cache pather for improved reliability.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#18365](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18365) "op-node: Light CL: Follow Source" proposes changes to the op-node for light client functionality.
- [#18361](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18361) "op-daployer: guard L1() against nil state to prevent panic" aims to prevent panics in the op-deployer by adding a nil state guard.
- [#18360](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18360) "test(contracts): add AddressAliasHelper coverage and fix SystemConfig flaky test" focuses on improving contract test coverage and stability.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fault Proof System Documentation and Testing
An issue related to updating runbooks for Kona + Cannon fault proof systems was closed, indicating progress in documenting the procedure for switching to these systems and addressing risks associated with different game types across the Superchain. Another issue concerning the re-addition of `op-reth` to acceptance tests was also closed, with confirmation that `op-reth` is now integrated into `op-rs/kona` acceptance tests.

## NEW ISSUES

### Base Mainnet Performance and RPC Stability
Several new issues highlight concerns regarding Base Mainnet performance. These include intermittent RPC timeouts during high gas price periods for `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_sendTransaction`, and occasional L2 RPC request failures with custom Base Sequencer configurations.
- [#18362](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18362)
- [#18364](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18364)

### Gas Price Prediction and Batch Submission Efficiency
A feature request was opened for a Base Mainnet gas price prediction API endpoint to improve dApp user experience. Additionally, a bug was reported regarding `op-batcher` delays during high transaction volume on Base Mainnet, leading to increased L1 gas costs and delayed transaction finality.
- [#18363](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18363)
- [#18366](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18366)

### Proofs System Runbook Routing
A new issue was created to document a clear process for identifying the correct runbook for any given proofs deployment based on on-chain information.
- [#18372](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18372)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Docker Image References
Issue [#1657](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1657) concerns incorrect Docker image references on the node-operators releases page. The latest comment indicates a community member, yasnazariel, has expressed interest in working on this issue.

### Missing Environment Variable Documentation
Issue [#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1874) addresses the absence of corresponding environment variable descriptions for `op-node` and `op-geth` flags in the documentation. yasnazariel has also offered to take on this task.
