# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining CI processes, removing deprecated feature flags for dispute game v2, and enhancing proof-related testing with Jovian fork. Several new issues were opened concerning client libraries and withdrawal scripts.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD Enhancements and Infrastructure Improvements
Efforts were made to improve the CI pipeline with caching and retries, utilizing a development release of `circleci-utils` for testing. Additionally, a utility for safe file renaming was introduced to address issues with GitHub release binary providers.
- [#18572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18572)
- [#18610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18610)

### Dispute Game v2 Feature Flag Removal
The `cannon-kona dgv2` feature flags were removed across various components, including acceptance tests, deployer configurations, and bedrock contracts, signifying a step towards full integration of the dispute game v2.
- [#18588](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18588)

### Proofs and Node Synchronization Updates
Significant work was done to enable the Jovian hard fork for proofs precompile tests, addressing a previously open issue. The `op-node` was updated to always follow the source using the CL, and the pinned Kona client version for proofs was updated.
- [#18606](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18606)
- [#18571](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18571)
- [#18611](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18611)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#18609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18609) test(contracts): improve AdminFaucetAuthModule test coverage
- [#18607](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18607) Remove compiled binaries from repository

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Jovian Fork for Precompile Tests
The issue tracking the implementation of Jovian fork for precompile fault proof tests was closed, indicating successful integration.
- [#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17348)

## NEW ISSUES
### `op-challenger` Panic on BlobBaseFee
A new issue reports that `op-challenger` panics with an "invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference" error when the L1 does not support `blobBaseFee`, suggesting a need for more robust handling of L1 client capabilities.
- [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18608)

### Deprecated Field Cleanup and Interop Test Assurance
Two issues were opened to address cleanup of deprecated OPCMv1 fields in the `ReadSuperchainDeployment` script and to ensure that Kona interop action tests are not disabled.
- [#18612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18612)
- [#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18613)

### Withdrawal Proving Logic Updates
New issues highlight the need for client libraries to use timestamps instead of block numbers for proving withdrawals and for the `op-chain-ops` prove withdrawals script to be updated to use output roots for interop.
- [#18614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18614)
- [#18615](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18615)

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-challenger` Panic on BlobBaseFee ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18608))
The issue describes a panic in `op-challenger` due to a nil pointer dereference when the L1 client does not support `blobBaseFee`. The user confirmed this occurs with a local private chain running an old Geth version that doesn't support Dencun. The user suggested adding a flag similar to `--data-availability-type=calldata` in `op-batch` to prevent the panic. A maintainer requested more information on the `op-challenger` version, L1 client, and L1 configuration to diagnose the `RecordBlobBaseFee` error, suspecting an uninitialized field related to `BlobBaseFee` metrics.

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574))
Discussion revolves around the necessity and implementation of injected replacement transactions for invalid interop transactions. A maintainer emphasized that the additional transaction recording the replaced block hash is critical for the proofs system to prevent overwhelming honest challengers. Another maintainer suggested that the Supernode should be able to generate the necessary data for proof, potentially simplifying the protocol by not adding an extra deposit transaction.

### Node Synchronization Issues ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581))
Users are reporting issues with nodes not synchronizing, with errors like "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload." These errors typically indicate that the L1 Execution Client cannot provide the `Op-Node` with necessary state data. A maintainer requested detailed information on client configurations (L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client), full logs, and startup flags for all three clients to aid in diagnosis. One user noted similar problems with Publicnode snapshots but found success with `snapsync` using `--syncmode=execution-layer`.
