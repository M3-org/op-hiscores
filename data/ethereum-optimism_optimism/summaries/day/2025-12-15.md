## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#18609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18609): `test(contracts): improve AdminFaucetAuthModule test coverage` - This PR aims to enhance the test coverage for the `AdminFaucetAuthModule` contract.
- [#18607](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18607): `Remove compiled binaries from repository` - This PR proposes removing compiled binaries from the repository, likely to reduce repository size and improve build processes.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fault Proof System Testing
An issue related to running precompile Fault Proof tests on the Jovian fork was closed, indicating successful implementation and testing of this feature.
- [#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17348)

## NEW ISSUES

### op-challenger Critical Bug
A critical bug in `op-challenger` was reported, where an invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference occurs if the L1 does not support `blobBaseFee`, leading to a panic.
- [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18608)

### Superchain Deployment Script Cleanup
An issue was opened to remove deprecated OPCMv1 fields from the `ReadSuperchainDeployment` script, aiming to clean up the codebase after OPCMv1 deprecation.
- [#18612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18612)

### Interoperability Proofs and Withdrawal Scripts
Several issues were created concerning interoperability proofs, including ensuring Kona interop action tests are enabled, and updating client libraries and `op-chain-ops` scripts to use timestamps and output roots for proving withdrawals.
- [#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18613)
- [#18614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18614)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-challenger` Nil Pointer Dereference ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18608))
Discussion revolves around a critical `nil pointer dereference` in `op-challenger` when the L1 does not support `blobBaseFee`. The user confirmed the issue occurs with a local private chain using an old Geth version that doesn't support Dencun. The suggestion is to add a flag similar to `--data-availability-type=calldata` in `op-batch` to prevent the panic. A maintainer requested more information on the `op-challenger` version, L1 client, and configuration to diagnose and patch the issue.

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574))
The discussion centers on the necessity of an additional transaction for proofs in the interop system. A maintainer emphasized that the additional transaction recording the replaced block hash is critical for the proofs system to prevent overwhelming honest challengers. Another contributor suggested that the Supernode should be able to generate the necessary data for proof without an extra deposit transaction, simplifying the protocol. The latest comment suggests a consensus to simplify the protocol by eliminating the additional deposit transaction for proofs and recommends assigning someone to architect this refactoring and update the Interop specification.

### Node Synchronization Issues ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581))
Users are reporting `missing trie node` and `Failed to build payload` errors, indicating L1 Execution Client issues in providing state data to `Op-Node`. A maintainer requested detailed client configurations (L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client), full logs, and startup flags for all clients to diagnose the problem. One user mentioned experiencing the same issue with Publicnode snapshots but found success with `snapsync --syncmode=execution-layer`.

### `kona-sp1`: Ensure Expensive Operations are Offloaded to the Host ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18533))
The issue addresses the need to offload expensive cryptographic operations like `keccak` and `sha2` to the host for performance in the `kona-sp1` program. A maintainer inquired about the progress in identifying all areas requiring offloading and if other computationally expensive operations might need a similar approach.

### Finalize U18 Releases ([#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18548))
A maintainer requested an update on the status of governance approval for `op-program` and any critical issues found on the testnet that could block the finalization of Upgrade 18 releases.

### `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` Fuzzing Test Failure ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18554))
A critical bug report highlights a fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when `_7702Target = address(0)`. A maintainer suggested prioritizing this as a critical bug and assigning a contracts developer to address the logical error in handling zero addresses and their impact on aliasing.

### `chore(sysgo/p2p)`: Fix `op-reth <-> op-geth` Connection Flakiness ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18570))
The issue describes flakiness in P2P connections between `op-reth` and `op-geth` nodes in system tests. A maintainer recommended classifying this as a major bug or high-priority chore and assigning someone to investigate the P2P implementation differences and `admin_peers` encoding.
