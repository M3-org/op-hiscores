# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing CI processes, enabling Jovian for proofs precompile tests, and refining the op-node's light client to always follow the source using CL. Several new issues were opened, including a critical `op-challenger` panic related to L1 blob support.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD and Build Process Improvements
A new feature was added to the CI pipeline to improve caching and introduce retries, aiming for more robust and efficient continuous integration.
- CI enhancements: [#18572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18572)

### Fault Proof System Enhancements
Significant work was done to update the fault proof system, including enabling the Jovian hard fork for precompile tests and updating the pinned Kona client version.

- Kona client version update: [#18611](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18611)

### Node Synchronization and Stability
The `op-node`'s light client was updated to consistently follow the source using the Consensus Layer (CL), improving synchronization mechanisms. A utility for safe file renaming was also added to enhance deployment reliability.
- Light CL always follows source: [#18571](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18571)
- SafeRename utility: [#18610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18610)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Test Coverage for AdminFaucetAuthModule**: A new pull request aims to improve test coverage for the `AdminFaucetAuthModule` contract ([#18609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18609)).
- **Removal of Compiled Binaries**: A pull request was opened to remove compiled binaries from the repository, likely to reduce repository size and improve build hygiene ([#18607](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18607)).

## CLOSED ISSUES
- **Jovian Fork for Precompile FP Tests**: The issue tracking the implementation of Jovian fork for precompile fault proof tests has been closed, indicating successful integration and testing ([#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17348)).

## NEW ISSUES
- **`op-challenger` Panic on L1 Blob Support**: A critical issue was reported where `op-challenger` panics due to an invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference if the L1 does not support `blobBaseFee`. This suggests a need for more robust handling of L1 client capabilities ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18608)).
- **Deprecated OPCMv1 Fields Cleanup**: An issue was opened to remove deprecated OPCMv1 fields in the `ReadSuperchainDeployment` script, aiming to clean up the codebase after OPCMv1 is fully deprecated ([#18612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18612)).
- **Kona Interop Action Tests**: A new issue highlights the need to ensure that Kona interop action tests are not disabled, indicating a potential oversight in test configuration or execution ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18613)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **`op-challenger` Panic on L1 Blob Support** ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18608)): The discussion centers around a `nil pointer dereference` in `op-challenger` when the L1 client doesn't support `blobBaseFee`. The reporter confirmed using an untagged `op-challenger` version and Geth v1.13.15 on a local private chain without Dencun upgrade. The core problem is `op-challenger` attempting to access a `BlobBaseFee`-related field that is `nil` because it wasn't initialized, suggesting a need for a flag or logic similar to `op-batch`'s `--data-availability-type=calldata` to prevent panics on older L1s.
- **Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx** ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574)): The conversation revolves around the necessity and implications of the injected replacement transaction for invalid interop transactions. There's a debate on whether the additional transaction recording the block hash is critical for the proofs system or if the Supernode could provide the necessary data. The current consensus is that the additional transaction is crucial for proofs to avoid re-running derivation and prevent overwhelming honest challengers, and it's unlikely to exceed the block gas limit due to reserved gas for system transactions.
- **The Node is Not Synchronized** ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581)): Users are reporting `missing trie node` and `Failed to build payload` errors, indicating issues with the L1 Execution Client providing necessary state data to the Op-Node. The latest comments request detailed information on client configurations (L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client), full logs, and startup flags for all three clients to diagnose the synchronization problem.
- **`_7702Target = address(0)` Fuzzing Test Failure** ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18554)): This issue highlights a critical fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when `_7702Target` is `address(0)`. The problem points to potentially incorrect behavior when handling deposits involving the zero address and its impact on aliasing. Immediate prioritization as a critical bug and assignment to a contracts developer is suggested to fix the logic error related to etching empty bytes.
- **`chore(sysgo/p2p): fix op-reth <-> op-geth connection flakiness`** ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18570)): The issue describes flakiness in P2P connections between `op-reth` and `op-geth` nodes in system tests. This is considered a major bug affecting test stability and potential production compatibility. The discussion emphasizes the need to assign a developer to investigate the P2P implementation differences and verify the correctness of `admin_peers` encoding.
- **`kona-sp1: Ensure expensive operations are offloaded to the host`** ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18533)): The discussion focuses on optimizing `kona-sp1` for ZK Proofs by offloading expensive operations like `keccak` and `sha2` to the host via syscalls. Questions were raised about identifying all code areas where these operations occur outside the EVM and if other computationally intensive operations might require a similar approach.
- **`Finalize U18 releases`** ([#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18548)): This issue tracks the finalization of Upgrade 18 releases. The latest comment requests an update on two key blocking factors: governance approval for `op-program` and any critical issues found during testnet operations.
