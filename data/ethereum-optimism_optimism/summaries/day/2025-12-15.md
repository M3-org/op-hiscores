# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing CI processes, improving fault proof testing, and refining the op-node's light client functionality. Several new issues were opened, addressing client library updates and deprecated fields.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD Enhancements
A new feature was added to the CI pipeline, introducing `mise` for caching and retries, aiming to improve the efficiency and reliability of continuous integration processes. This is currently in a testing phase using a development release of `circleci-utils`.
- [#18572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18572)

### Fault Proof System Improvements
Significant work was done to enable Jovian for proofs precompile tests within the `op-e2e` framework, specifically for L2, and Osaka for L1. This update ensures that the latest hard fork configurations are used for robust testing of the fault proof system. The Kona client version for proofs was also updated.

- [#18611](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18611)

### Op-Node Light Client and Utility Refinements
The `op-node` now consistently follows the source using the Consensus Layer (CL) for its light client functionality, building on previous work to enhance synchronization. Additionally, a `SafeRename` utility was added to `op-service/ioutil` to address issues with `os.Rename` in the GitHub release binary provider.

- [#18610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18610)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#18609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18609): This PR aims to improve test coverage for the `AdminFaucetAuthModule` within the contracts.
- [#18607](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18607): This PR proposes removing compiled binaries from the repository.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Fault Proof Testing Advancement
The issue concerning running precompile fault proof tests on the Jovian fork has been closed, indicating successful implementation and integration of these tests.
- [#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17348)

## NEW ISSUES

### Client Library and Script Updates
New issues highlight the need for client libraries to use timestamps instead of block numbers for proving withdrawals and updating the `op-chain-ops` prove withdrawals script to utilize output roots for interop.
- [#18614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18614)
- [#18615](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18615)

### Deprecated Field Cleanup
An issue was opened to remove deprecated OPCMv1 fields from the `ReadSuperchainDeployment` script, aiming to clean up the codebase after the full deprecation of OPCMv1.
- [#18612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18612)

### Interop Action Test Assurance
A new issue was created to ensure that Kona interop action tests are not disabled, emphasizing the importance of continuous testing for interoperability.
- [#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18613)

### Op-Challenger Panic on Old L1 Clients
A critical issue was reported where `op-challenger` panics due to an invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference when connected to an L1 client that does not support `blobBaseFee`. This is likely due to the `op-challenger` attempting to access an uninitialized `BlobBaseFee` field for metrics.
- [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18608)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona-SP1 Optimization for ZK Proofs
Discussion on [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18533) focuses on offloading expensive operations like `keccak` and `sha2` to the host for `kona-sp1` to optimize ZK Proofs. A key question is whether all such operations outside the EVM have been identified for syscall offloading and if other computationally intensive operations might require a similar approach.

### Finalizing U18 Releases
Issue [#18548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18548) tracks the finalization of Upgrade 18 releases. The latest comments inquire about the status of governance approval for `op-program` and any critical issues found on the testnet that could block the release.

### `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` Fuzzing Test Failure
Issue [#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18554) reports a critical fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when `_7702Target` is `address(0)`. This indicates a potential logic error in handling deposits with a null address and its impact on aliasing, with a recommendation for immediate prioritization and assignment to a contracts developer.

### Op-Reth <-> Op-Geth Connection Flakiness
The discussion on [#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18570) addresses flakiness in `op-reth` <-> `op-geth` P2P connections within system tests. This is considered a major bug affecting test stability and potential production compatibility, requiring investigation into P2P implementation differences and `admin_peers` encoding.

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx
Issue [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574) discusses the need to evaluate and rework injected replacement transactions for invalid interop transactions. The conversation highlights the critical role of additional transaction recording for the proofs system to identify replaced block hashes, preventing overwhelming honest challengers. There's also a debate on whether the Supernode could provide this data to simplify the protocol.

### Node Synchronization Issues
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581) reports problems with node synchronization, specifically "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. These errors suggest that the L1 Execution Client cannot provide necessary state data to the Op-Node for L2 block creation. Further information on client configurations, full logs, and startup flags for all clients is requested for diagnosis.
