# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Oct 10, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on addressing potential issues within the `op-dispute-mon` component, specifically around handling out-of-sync nodes and improving "not found" scenarios.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#17825](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17825), was opened to improve the handling of "not found" scenarios within `op-dispute-mon`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

## NEW ISSUES
- **`op-dispute-mon` Synchronization Challenges:** A new issue, [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814), was opened to address how `op-dispute-mon` handles out-of-sync nodes. The problem arises when multiple rollup RPCs are configured, and one is behind, leading to it being incorrectly detected as a disagreement rather than an out-of-sync state. Discussions suggest using `syncStatus` to determine if a node has processed the relevant L1 block and ignoring results from behind nodes.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **`op-dispute-mon` Out-of-Sync Node Handling:** On [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814), discussions are ongoing regarding how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes. The latest comment from ajsutton at 2025-10-12T20:33:19Z highlights that simply trusting the highest L2 block might be incorrect if it's from a node on an incorrect fork. The suggestion is to check the `CurrentL1` from the sync status to confirm if the node has processed the L1 block where the dispute game was created. If not, the node is considered behind and its results may be invalid. Earlier, pauldowman at 2025-10-10T16:18:14Z noted that [#17819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17819) will mitigate the problem for real output root not found errors, but a general solution might involve using `syncStatus` to identify the highest unsafe block across all nodes and ignoring results from nodes that are behind.
