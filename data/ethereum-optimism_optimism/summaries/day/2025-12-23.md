# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, specifically addressing port collisions in acceptance tests, and minor code clarifications.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements
A significant bug fix was implemented to resolve port collision issues in `op-acceptance-tests`, which previously caused errors like "address already in use" during flashblocks acceptance tests. This involved modifications across several files in `op-devstack/sysgo` and `op-devstack/dsl` to ensure proper port handling. ([#18684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18684))

### Code Clarity and Maintenance
A comment in `op-node/rollup/derive/batches.go` was clarified to prevent potential confusion, which had previously led to an innocuous security report. ([#18512](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18512))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#18691](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18691), was opened to handle Go module pseudo-versions and fix the Kona prestate name in `check-prestate`.
- Another PR, [#18690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18690), proposes using HTTPS for Git submodules.
- [#18689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18689) aims to remove asterisc contracts.
