# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, specifically addressing port collisions in acceptance tests, and minor code clarifications.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements
- **Flashblocks Acceptance Test Port Collisions:** A bug causing port collisions during flashblocks acceptance tests was fixed, resolving "address already in use" errors. This involved changes across several `op-devstack` files to ensure proper port management. ([#18684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18684))

### Code Clarity
- **Comment Clarification in op-node:** A comment in `op-node` was clarified to prevent potential confusion, which had previously led to an innocuous security report. ([#18512](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18512))
