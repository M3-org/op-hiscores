# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Aug 25, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in devnet capabilities with flashblocks support, critical bug fixes for Superchain configuration, and extensive updates to core dependencies including Geth and Cannon. Several issues related to developer experience and infrastructure were also addressed and closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Devnet Enhancements & Testing Infrastructure
Flashblocks support was added to the Kurtosis devnet, enabling more robust testing environments ([#17172](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17172)). Improvements were also made to the sync tester in `op-devstack` ([#17198](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17198)) and fork retry logic was added to upgrade tests to enhance reliability ([#17201](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17201)).

### Core Dependency Updates & Refinements
The `op-geth` dependency was updated to include upstream Geth v1.16.1 changes ([#16785](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16785)). Cannon deployment now supports Go 1.24 ([#17155](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17155)), and the `op-node` driver package was reorganized for better structure ([#17098](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17098)).

### Bug Fixes & Tooling Improvements
A critical bug in the `superchain-config` fuzz test was fixed, specifically addressing `ProxyAdmin` constraints ([#17203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17203)). The `op-chain-ops` tool received an update to handle new Forge compiler profiles for source map loading ([#17196](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17196)). Additionally, `op-up` was enhanced with ASCII art and a survey link for improved user experience ([#17205](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17205), [#17206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17206)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#17197](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17197) `op-acceptance-tests`: Adds sync tester tests.
- [#17199](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17199) `chore(op-challenger)`: Corrects an error message for `GetGameRange` calls.
- [#17202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17202) `chore(tests)`: Bumps Kurtosis package to a fully reproducible version compatible with the new deployer.
- [#17212](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17212) `feat(ci)`: Configures CI to run on proposal branches.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Core Protocol & Infrastructure Updates
Several issues related to core protocol updates and infrastructure were closed. This includes the completion of the Geth v1.16.1 merge ([#16825](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16825)), and the support for Cannon with Go 1.24 ([#17095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17095)). A tracking issue for consensus-influencing event nonces was closed as it is not being implemented currently ([#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13543)).

### Developer Experience & Tooling Improvements
Efforts to reduce friction between Go and Solidity development were completed ([#14976](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14976)). Issues related to `op-up` logging cleanup ([#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17007)), adding ASCII art on startup ([#17134](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17134)), and including a survey link on shutdown ([#17135](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17135)) were also closed.

### Operational & Testing Enhancements
The rollout and release of `op-batcher` was completed ([#16843](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16843)). An issue concerning missing test logs in `op-acceptance-tests` was resolved ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17151)). A cronjob for mempool rebroadcaster deployment was also addressed ([#16932](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16932)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Forge Deployer Migration
A series of new issues were opened to track the migration of the OP Deployer to use Forge. This includes a tracking issue for the overall migration ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17213)), creating a CLI wrapper around the Forge binary ([#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17214)), and converting specific deployment functions like `DeploySuperchain` ([#17215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17215)), `DeployImplementations` ([#17216](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17216)), and `DeployOPChain` ([#17217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17217)) to use Forge. The conversion of contract verification logic to use Forge is also tracked ([#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17218)).

### Technical Specification Updates
An issue was created to update the Cannon FPVM specification to include `getrandom` syscall changes related to Go 1.24 features ([#17207](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17207)).

### Kurtosis & Websockets
A feature request was opened to implement Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17194)).
