# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on core contract updates for OPCMv2, critical bug fixes for deployer integration tests, and significant improvements to the dispute monitoring system. Several CI enhancements were also implemented to streamline the release workflow.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Contracts and Dispute System Enhancements
Key updates were made to the core OP Stack contracts, specifically modifying the `AnchorStateRegistry`'s `initialize` function to support OPCMv2 requirements [#18244](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18244). Additionally, the `op-dispute-mon` tool saw a significant refactor, renaming `L2BlockNumber` to `L2SequenceNumber` to improve clarity and prevent confusion across different game types [#18278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18278).

### Deployment and Testing Infrastructure Improvements
A critical bug fix was implemented to update the expected `SuperchainConfigProxy` implementation, resolving issues that arose after a recent Sepolia upgrade and unblocking further PRs [#18293](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18293). The `op-devstack` also gained configurable attempts for "EL NotAdvanced" scenarios, enhancing the robustness of interop sync tests [#18286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18286).

### CI/CD Workflow Streamlining
The CI pipeline received several updates to improve the release workflow. This included reinstating and properly wiring the `initialize` job with correct tag and branch filters [#18284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18284), and adding a requirement for the `--initialize` flag to subsequent jobs in the release workflow to ensure proper execution [#18285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18285).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A range of new features and improvements were proposed today, including an address overload for `setBatcherHash` [#18298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18298), the addition of `logfmtms` to Log Format Usage in `op-service` [#18297](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18297), and fixes for `DisputeGameFactory` fuzz tests [#18296](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18296). Other notable PRs include the introduction of `ConditionalDeployer` [#18295](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18295) and `NetworkUpgradeTxns` library [#18294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18294), atomic L1 receipt parsing in `SystemConfig` [#18292](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18292), and a new `L2 Contracts Manager` [#18289](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18289). CI improvements for contracts [#18291](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18291) and derivation logic for `op-node` [#18290](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18290), along with a fix for old batch epoch handling [#18283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18283) and removal of an unused syncmode [#18282](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18282) were also opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### ZK Proofs and Block Header Oracle Enhancements
The issue concerning adding a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program` [#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17416) was closed. The discussion confirmed that a hint was added to `op-program`, and while `op-geth` still handles lookups via `debug_dbGet`, `kona-client` now uses slightly different logic that reads the storage slot directly, making the original goal achieved.

### Kona Compatibility and Prestate Support
Two issues related to Kona compatibility were resolved. The problem with Kona's incompatibility with websocket URLs in acceptance tests [#18203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18203) was closed after Kona was updated to support them. Additionally, the tracking issue for adding support for embedded custom prestates to Kona [#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18271) was closed, with a fix currently under review.

## NEW ISSUES

### ZK Proofs Project Tracking
A new tracking issue has been opened for the ZK Proofs project [#18281](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18281). This will serve as the central hub for the project, linking to design documents and internal Notion pages.

### Kona Interoperability and Challenger Fixes
New issues highlight areas for improvement in Kona interoperability and the `op-challenger`. One issue addresses the need to fix host arguments in the Kona super executor for `op-challenger` due to updated `kona-interop` host arguments [#18287](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18287). Another tracking issue calls for a review of the `kona-interop` block hash oracle, specifically its use of EIP-2935 for efficient block hash lookups [#18288](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18288).
