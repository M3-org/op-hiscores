# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on core contract updates for OPCMv2, critical bug fixes for deployer integration tests, and significant improvements to the op-dispute-mon and op-devstack tools. CI/CD enhancements were also implemented to streamline the release workflow.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Contract Enhancements
Key changes were made to the core OP Stack contracts, specifically updating the `AnchorStateRegistry`'s `initialize` function to support OPCMv2. This is a foundational step for future protocol upgrades.
- [#18244](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18244)

### Deployer and Test Infrastructure Improvements
A critical bug fix was implemented to update the expected `SuperchainConfigProxy` implementation, resolving issues that arose after a recent Sepolia upgrade and unblocking further PRs. Additionally, the `op-devstack` now allows configurable attempts for "EL Not Advanced" scenarios, improving testing robustness.

- [#18286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18286)

### Dispute Monitoring and CI/CD Refinements
The `op-dispute-mon` tool saw a significant renaming of `L2BlockNumber` to `L2SequenceNumber` to accurately reflect its use across different game types, reducing confusion. Furthermore, the CI/CD pipeline was improved by reinstating and correctly wiring the `initialize` job in the release workflow, ensuring subsequent jobs run as expected. The `op-geth` dependency was also upgraded.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kona Compatibility and Oracle Improvements
Several issues related to Kona compatibility and oracle functionality were resolved. This includes addressing Kona's lack of websocket support in acceptance tests and adding a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program`.
- [#18203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18203)
- [#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17416)

### Custom Prestate Support for Kona
Support for embedded custom prestates in Kona was successfully added, with the fix already in review.

## NEW ISSUES

### ZK Proofs Tracking
A new tracking issue has been created to serve as the main hub for the ZK Proofs project, linking to design documents and internal Notion pages.
- [#18281](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18281)

### Kona Interoperability Challenges
Two new issues highlight challenges with Kona interoperability: one concerning the need to update `op-challenger` to reflect changes in `kona-interop` host arguments, and another tracking the review of the `kona-interop` block hash oracle's use of EIP-2935.
