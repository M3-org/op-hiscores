# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Aug 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the Cannon VM by dropping version 7 feature flags, improving developer tooling with a new RPC endpoint for devstack, and significant progress in acceptance testing for dispute games. Several issues related to interop acceptance testing and event system cleanup were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Cannon VM and Protocol Enhancements
The Cannon VM saw updates with the removal of version 7 feature flags, streamlining the codebase as newer versions are adopted. This also included preparations for Go 1.25 compatibility by disabling specific memory mapping annotations in `op-program`.
- [#17167](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17167)
- [#17176](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17176)

### Developer Tooling and Deployment Improvements
A new RPC endpoint was exposed for the devstack L2 CL nodes, providing developers with better access to custom RPC methods. The `op-deployer` also gained forge autodiscovery capabilities, enhancing deployment workflows.
- [#17168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17168)
- [#17152](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17152)

### Acceptance Testing and Dispute Game Enhancements
Significant work was done on acceptance tests, introducing a `GameHelper` contract to facilitate multiple moves in dispute games within a single transaction. This improves the efficiency and scope of testing dispute game logic.
- [#16994](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16994)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#17169](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17169) proposes adding ASCII art on `op-up` startup for a more engaging user experience.
- [#17170](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17170) aims to augment the sync tester configuration for `op-sync-tester`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interoperability and Proofs Acceptance Testing
Several issues related to interop acceptance testing for the proofs system were closed, indicating significant progress in validating the dispute game functionality across different chain setups. This includes the successful implementation of `op-challenger` acceptance tests.
- [#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15946)
- [#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15948)
- [#16168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16168)

### Codebase Cleanup and Optimization
Issues addressing code cleanup and optimization were resolved, including the removal of unused withdrawal action methods and the elimination of unnecessary version checks in `op-program`.
- [#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17001)
- [#15218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15218)

## NEW ISSUES

### Documentation and Configuration Updates
New issues highlight the need to update documentation for `op-batcher`'s throttling configuration and defaults, ensuring accuracy for users.
- [#17171](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17171)

### Deployment and Tooling Improvements
Challenges in deployment tooling were identified, specifically the need for `op-deployer` to generate Gnosis Safe wrapped calldata for easier use by most users.
- [#17173](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17173)

### Testing and Cannon VM Future Work
Issues were opened to improve parallelism in `op-e2e` fault proof tests and to plan for the future removal of Cannon version 7 support and Go 1.24 feature flags once newer versions are stable in production.
- [#17175](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17175)
- [#17177](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17177)
- [#17178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17178)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Contract Verification Improvements
Discussion on [#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14813) continues, with the latest comment suggesting revisiting `op-deployer` contract verification to leverage `forge verify-contract` once forge binary support is fully implemented. This aims to reduce custom verification code and streamline the process for Etherscan and Blockscout.

### Test Target Setup/Teardown
Issue [#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/375) was closed, with the latest comment indicating that Kurtosis is no longer considered as important for network testing compared to Sysgo.
