# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Aug 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes for service binding, significant refactoring of event handling, and extensive updates to testing infrastructure, including the addition of Cannon allocator instrumentation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Infrastructure Stability & Bug Fixes
A critical bug causing connection errors and test failures due to default IPv6 binding was resolved by explicitly setting IPv4 binding for `op-devstack` services ([#17114](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17114)). This improves the reliability of development environments.

### Codebase Refinements & Event System Optimization
The codebase saw significant refactoring with the removal of `CrossUpdateRequestEvent`, `CrossUnsafeUpdateEvent`, and `CrossSafeUpdateEvent` ([#17101](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17101)). This streamlines the event handling within `op-e2e` and `op-node/rollup` components.

### Testing & CI Enhancements
Improvements were made to the CI pipeline to optimize test execution, including running contracts tests only on relevant changes ([#17105](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17105)) and ensuring `contracts-bedrock-tests` correctly depend on `op-node` ([#17116](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17116)). Additionally, the flaky `TestCrossLayerUser` was removed from `op-e2e` to improve test suite stability ([#17106](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17106)).

### Cannon Allocator Instrumentation & VM Runner Logic
Work continued on integrating allocator preheap instrumentation into Cannon ([#16030](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16030)), a rebased contribution aimed at improving performance in constrained environments. The `vm-runner`'s L2 block selection logic was also reworked to ensure safer L2 block usage relative to the chosen L1 head ([#17089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17089)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Nine new pull requests were opened today, covering a range of fixes, features, and refactoring efforts. These include backporting a test ([#17109](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17109)), adding missing methods to structs and interfaces ([#17111](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17111), [#17113](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17113)), removing a TODO from `Setup.sol` ([#17112](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17112)), and migrating to structured logging with `slog` ([#17118](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17118)). New features include integrating `FaultDisputeGameV2` into DGF ([#17119](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17119)), and refactoring efforts involve migrating from `reflect.TypeOf` to `reflect.TypeFor` in `op-service` and `op-chain-ops` ([#17120](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17120), [#17121](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17121)), and merging `EngineResetDeriver` and `EngineController` in `op-node` ([#17125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17125)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Cannon Optimization & Performance
The long-standing issue regarding Cannon optimizations ([#11550](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/11550)) was closed today. This issue tracked various performance improvements for Cannon, including more space-efficient state snapshots and memory merklization. Related PRs and ongoing work were noted in the comments, indicating progress in this area.

### Devstack Service Binding Fix
A reported issue concerning `op-devstack`'s default host binding causing connection errors and test failures ([#17082](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17082)) was closed. This indicates that the fix implemented in [#17114](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17114) successfully addressed the problem.

## NEW ISSUES

### Documentation & Release Clarity
A new issue highlights confusion regarding `op-deployer`'s version numbering, noting that releases appear non-sequential and counterintuitive ([#17108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17108)). This suggests a need for clearer release management or documentation for `op-deployer`.

### Codebase Refactoring & Dependency Management
A tracking issue was opened to resolve dependency cycles within `op-node` components ([#17115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17115)). This indicates an ongoing effort to improve the architectural clarity and maintainability of the `op-node` codebase.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Event System Refinement
Discussions on [#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17001), "Remove two events from event system," indicate active progress. The latest comments confirm that two related pull requests ([#16997](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16997) and [#17122](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17122)) have been opened to address the removal of these events, with a second one ([#17165](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17165)) also mentioned. This suggests a phased approach to streamlining the event system.
