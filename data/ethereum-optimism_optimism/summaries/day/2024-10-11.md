## NEW ISSUES

### Fault Proof Contract Refactoring
A new issue, [#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421), was opened to address the need for refactoring fault proof contracts to support `Creator` contracts. This is crucial because current fault proof contracts must be redeployed for each new L2 chain due to changing constructor arguments, leading to high deployment costs and bottlenecks in upgrade processes.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Refactor proofs contracts to support `Creator` contracts
Discussion on [#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421) highlights the ongoing need to refactor dispute game contracts to remove immutables, allowing for shared implementations across chains. The current deployment cost of these large contracts (3-5M gas) significantly limits the number of chains that can be updated in a single transaction, making it a bottleneck for scaling upgrade processes. While the `AnchorStateRegistry` no longer has immutables, the dispute game contracts still require this refactoring. The issue's priority was temporarily paused but is now being re-evaluated due to its impact on upgrade efficiency. A related design document ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/275](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/275)) has been updated based on the latest direction.
