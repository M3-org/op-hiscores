# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Nov 2, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `op-dispute-mon` with new error metrics for node endpoints and fixing a bug in `opcm` related to the `CANNON_KONA` initial bond during upgrades.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dispute Monitor Enhancements
New Prometheus metrics were added to `op-dispute-mon` to track node endpoint errors, providing better visibility into RPC failures during update cycles. This includes a gauge for the total number of endpoints that returned an error. ([#17622](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17622))

### Contracts Manager Bug Fix
A bug in `opcm.upgrade` was fixed, ensuring that the `CANNON_KONA` initial bond is correctly set during contract upgrades. ([#18100](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18100))
