# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Sep 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in enhancing testing infrastructure with updates to `op-acceptance-tests` and improvements to the `op-devstack`. Several issues related to Flashblocks monitoring and deployment were closed, indicating a push towards stabilizing the Superchain.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Acceptance Testing and CI Stability
Updates to `op-acceptance-tests` include a new version with an optional progress indicator ([#17422](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17422)) and configuration for flashblocks-with-isthmus gate ([#17413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17413)). Additionally, a temporary increase in CircleCI timeout was implemented to address occasional test stalling ([#17438](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17438)).

### Devstack Improvements and Bug Fixes
The `op-devstack` received a fix for Kona's startup code and now exposes the `UserRPC` endpoint, improving its functionality and restart capabilities ([#17390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17390)). A fix for slack in `semgrep-scan` was also implemented ([#17433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17433)).

### CI Configuration Reversion
A previous change to add a standalone check for `solc` warnings was reverted ([#17428](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17428)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Monitoring
Several issues related to Flashblocks deployment and monitoring were closed. This includes enabling Flashblocks on mainnet sequencers ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16759), [#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16760), [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17317)), deploying the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` ([#16763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16763)), and setting up monitoring and alerting for Flashblocks ([#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16388), [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16868), [#17143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17143)). The Flashblocks specification was also closed out ([#17162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17162)).

### `op-conductor` and `reth` Updates
The release and deployment of `op-conductor` with EL p2p healthchecks was completed ([#17153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17153)). An issue regarding upgrading `rbuilder` and `node-reth` for a `reth` chain stall fix was closed as it was deemed a non-blocker for L2 ([#17328](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17328)).

### Documentation and Testing Cleanup
A documentation issue suggesting an example for custom chains in bridging ETH to OP Mainnet was closed after the tutorial was updated ([#1473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1473)). Several smoke test issues for `op-challenger` ([#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/141)), proofs ([#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/140)), `op-dispute-mon` ([#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/142)), and `op-proposer` ([#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/143)) were closed as they are no longer required.

## NEW ISSUES

### Flashblocks Alerting Refinement
A new issue was opened to refine alerts and runbooks for Flashblocks, emphasizing the need for clear justifications for thresholds ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17423)).

### Dispute Game Creator Refactor
An issue was created to update specifications following changes to the dispute game contract parameters and to review related references ([#17436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17436)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis Reverse Proxy Websockets Support
Discussion on [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17194) indicates that Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy will not be implemented. The latest comments confirm the decision to close the issue, with a request to remove a related TODO in the code.

### Soneium Contract Upgrade Tests
Issue [#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17332) tracks the addition of Soneium to contract upgrade tests. A PR has been opened to address this, indicating progress towards its resolution.

### `op-program` Fast Block Header Oracle Lookup
Issue [#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17416) focuses on adding a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program`. A draft PR has been created as a starting point for validation.
