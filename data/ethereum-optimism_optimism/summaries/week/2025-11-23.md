# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Nov 23 - 29, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was marked by a significant architectural evolution with the introduction of OPCM v2, a major overhaul of the contract management system designed to improve deployment and upgrade processes. Alongside this foundational work, substantial progress was made on enabling Custom Gas Tokens (CGT) for OP Stack chains, a key step towards greater Superchain ecosystem flexibility. While development advanced on these core features, a series of new issues highlighted emerging performance challenges on Base Mainnet, including RPC timeouts and batch submission delays, signaling a new area of focus for network stability and efficiency.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on core contract architecture, Superchain features, and robust testing infrastructure.

-   **OPCM v2: Overhauling Contract Management:** A major effort was dedicated to introducing and refining the OP Contracts Manager v2. This new version significantly refactors contract management within Bedrock, introducing new interfaces and updated deployment scripts ([#18079](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18079)). Enhancements included adding Blockscout verification support ([#18384](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18384)) and implementing safety checks to prevent invalid configurations during upgrades ([#18376](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18376)).

-   **Superchain Flexibility with Custom Gas Tokens:** Progress continued on allowing OP Stack chains to use assets other than ETH for fees. The core implementation for a minimal and flexible Custom Gas Token (CGT) saw significant development ([#18076](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18076)), and the development feature flag was removed, indicating the feature is maturing towards release ([#18379](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18379)).

-   **CI, Testing, and Deployment Tooling:** The project's testing and deployment infrastructure received numerous upgrades. The `op-deployer` was enhanced with backported Forge verification scripts to streamline contract verification ([#18352](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18352)). Testing was broadened with new acceptance tests for withdrawals using Cannon ([#18374](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18374)) and improvements to heavy fuzz tests for more comprehensive coverage ([#18368](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18368)).

-   **Protocol Bug Fixes and Refinements:** Several important fixes were implemented to improve protocol stability. A potential resource leak in the transaction manager was addressed ([#18358](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18358)), a bug in the `op-batcher`'s L1 origin update logic was fixed ([#18380](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18380)), and an issue causing unordered data posting to alternative DA servers with high concurrency was resolved ([#18378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18378)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

-   **Closed Issues:** Key problems resolved this week include making the Jovian fork the default for new chains to ensure modern configurations from genesis ([#18314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18314)). Progress was also made on the fault proof system, with the closure of issues related to updating runbooks for Kona + Cannon systems ([#17287](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17287)) and re-integrating `op-reth` into acceptance tests ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17475)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Base Mainnet Performance:** A critical new trend emerged with several issues reported concerning Base Mainnet performance under load. These include intermittent RPC timeouts for `eth_estimateGas` ([#18362](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18362)), L2 RPC request failures ([#18364](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18364)), and `op-batcher` delays leading to increased L1 costs ([#18366](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18366)). A related feature request for a gas price prediction API was also opened to improve dApp UX ([#18363](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18363)).
    -   **Fault Proofs & ZK Strategy:** Active discussions are shaping the future of the proofs system. Key debates include whether the Succinct Rust challenger should generate ZK proofs ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18319)) and how to best support ZK execution in `vm-runner` ([#18325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18325)). A universal runbook for the proofs system is also in development to clarify procedures ([#18372](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18372)).
    -   **Sequencer Stability:** An investigation is ongoing into a bug where the `op-node` sequencer incorrectly enters recover mode, potentially stalling derivation ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18350)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week highlighted healthy collaboration between core developers and the wider community. Active design discussions on ZK proof strategy and `AnchorStateRegistry` dependencies ([#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18347)) showcased a rigorous internal review process among team members. Furthermore, community member `yasnazariel` stepped up to address documentation gaps related to Docker image references ([#1657](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1657)) and environment variables ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1874)), demonstrating valuable external contributions to the project's usability. The coordinated effort across multiple pull requests to build and test OPCM v2 also points to strong internal alignment on major architectural upgrades.
