# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development was characterized by a dual focus on strengthening core infrastructure and laying the groundwork for significant future features. Substantial effort was dedicated to improving test reliability and CI efficiency, with numerous flaky tests fixed and build processes optimized. Concurrently, the team prepared for the upcoming Jovian hardfork and initiated major new workstreams for ZK game integration and a Light Consensus Layer (CL), evidenced by a large influx of planning issues. This forward-looking work was balanced by a focus on core component stability, including updates to Cannon and Kona, and a renewed effort to address long-standing technical debt.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on enhancing test infrastructure, updating core components, and preparing for future protocol upgrades.

- **Testing and CI/CD Enhancements:**
  - Test reliability was a major theme, with fixes for a flaking fuzz test in `DisputeGameFactory` ([#18296]) and the de-flaking of `TestMissingBatchE2E` ([#18304]).
  - CI efficiency was improved by adding a "latest" artifact fallback to reduce PR build times for contracts ([#18291], [#18310]) and fixing a failing artifact publishing job ([#18275]).
  - Test coverage was expanded by adding Go 1.25 compatibility tests for Cannon ([#18279]) and updating the `op-sync-tester` with Verifier Engine APIs for the Jovian hardfork ([#18307]).
  - Code quality was tightened by enforcing compiler warnings in contracts via `foundry.toml` ([#18264]).

- **Fault Proof and Node Component Updates:**
  - The `kona` fault proof component was upgraded to version 1.2.4, which enabled new cannon-kona acceptance tests ([#18231]). The `op-challenger` docker image was also updated to include `kona-host` v1.2.2 ([#18302]).
  - Cannon received several updates, including support for state version 7 in its Docker builds ([#18311]) and improved cleanup handling in the `multicannon` tool ([#18312]).
  - The `op-node` was updated with new optional flags (`l2.unsafe-only`, `l2.follow.source`) to support the development of the Light CL feature ([#18270]).

- **Core Protocol and Deployment Tooling:**
  - A feature was added to the `SystemConfig` contract to allow an address overload in the `setBatcherHash` function ([#18298]).
  - The `op-deployer` was improved to record its version in intent and state files, aiding in deployment tracking ([#18333]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Test Stability & Hardfork Prep:** Several flaky test issues were resolved ([#18138], [#17966]), and issues related to Jovian hardfork readiness were closed, confirming test coverage for operator fees and sync tester compatibility ([#17897], [#18126]).
  - **Component Compatibility:** Issues confirming Cannon's support for Go 1.25 ([#17060]) and Kona+Cannon OPCM compatibility ([#17285]) were closed.
  - **Feature Evaluation:** An issue to conduct simulations for the `min-base-fee` feature was closed ([#16958]), with the team opting to observe its performance in production instead.
  - **Housekeeping:** A significant number of older issues were closed due to age, resolution in later releases, or the deprecation of related tools like Kurtosis devnet.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **ZK Game Integration:** A major new initiative was kicked off with a suite of issues to track the integration of ZK games. This includes planning for monitoring ([#18323]), acceptance testing ([#18326]), proof generation ([#18319]), and challenging mechanisms ([#18322]).
  - **Light CL Development:** The Light CL feature was formalized with a main tracking issue ([#18315]) and specific milestones for disabling derivation and following external sources ([#18316], [#18317]).
  - **Technical Debt:** A recurring theme this week was the discussion around outstanding `TODO`s in the codebase. Several older issues related to the Event System Refactor were reopened or saw renewed activity, with a push to convert lingering `TODO` comments into trackable GitHub issues for better visibility and management ([#15817], [#16917]).
  - **Strategic Deferrals:** Discussions on issues related to EL Sync correctness ([#17631], [#18124], [#18125]) concluded with a decision to defer fixes until the Request/Response (RR) sync mechanism is fully deprecated, highlighting a key dependency for future work.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week saw strong internal collaboration focused on project health and future planning. Team members like `mslipper` were highly active in triaging older issues, assessing their relevance, and clarifying strategic decisions, such as deferring EL sync work.

A notable effort, championed by `ajsutton`, emerged to systematically address technical debt by converting `TODO` comments into formal issues ([#15817], [#16917]). This proactive approach to code maintenance demonstrates a commitment to long-term project health. The coordinated creation of a large set of planning issues for both ZK games and the Light CL feature indicates a structured, collaborative effort by the core team to launch the project's next major development phases.
