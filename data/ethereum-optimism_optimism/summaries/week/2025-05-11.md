# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (May 11 - 17, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This was a quiet week focused on internal planning and foundational improvements rather than new feature releases. Development activity centered on preparing for future workstreams and enhancing code maintainability. A key initiative for a future protocol upgrade, the "Interop proofs U17 proof upgrade," was formally tracked, signaling a continued focus on Superchain interoperability. Additionally, work began on a significant refactoring of the L2 test suite to improve its structure and documentation.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
No pull requests were merged during this period, indicating a focus on ongoing development and planning rather than completed work.

A new pull request was opened to begin a refactoring effort:
*   **L2 Test Suite Refactor:** Work has started on cleaning up and documenting the L2 test structure in PR [#15862](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/15862). This effort aims to improve the long-term maintainability and clarity of the project's test suite.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
### Closed Issues
No issues were closed this week.

### New & Active Issues
The primary activity in issues was related to strategic planning for a future protocol upgrade:
*   **Interop Proofs Upgrade:** A new tracking issue, [#15980](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15980), was created for the "Interop proofs U17 proof upgrade" workstream. This highlights a key technical priority related to enhancing cross-chain security and interoperability within the Superchain.

No other issues saw significant discussion during this period.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community interaction was minimal this week, with development activity appearing to be focused internally. The new work initiated, such as the L2 test suite cleanup ([#15862](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/15862)), reflects an internal focus on improving code quality and preparing the codebase for future contributions.
