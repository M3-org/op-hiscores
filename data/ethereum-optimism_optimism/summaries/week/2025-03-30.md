# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Mar 30 - 5, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Based on the available data, this week's activity centered on protocol integrity and security analysis. No new features or fixes were merged. The most significant event was the identification of a potential vulnerability within the `op-program` state transition logic, which was discovered as part of an external security audit by Spearbit. This finding has initiated discussions around strengthening the protocol's validation checks.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Based on the provided reports for the week, there were no new features, bug fixes, or other code contributions merged into the repository. Development activity was focused on issue triage and analysis rather than implementation.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The primary focus this week was on identifying and understanding a new security-related issue.

*   **New & Active Issues:** A critical new issue, [#15217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15217), was opened following a Spearbit audit. The finding points to an invalid pending progress length check in the `op-program: stateTransition` function during the consolidation step. Discussion on the issue has already confirmed its validity, and a potential fix involving the specification for the maximum number of chains has been suggested.

*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed this week.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was highlighted by the project's engagement with external security auditors. The findings from Spearbit and the subsequent internal discussion on issue [#15217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15217) demonstrate a proactive approach to identifying and addressing potential protocol vulnerabilities.
