# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week saw significant progress in preparing for the Jovian hardfork and advancing the next generation of the fault dispute system. Development focused on finalizing Jovian upgrade transactions, configuration settings, and validation logic, alongside a major push to integrate V2 dispute game contracts into the `OPContractsManager`. Concurrently, the team enhanced smart contract security within the SaferSafes suite and continued to improve the stability and efficiency of the CI/CD and testing infrastructure. These parallel efforts highlight a focus on both shipping near-term network upgrades and building a more robust and flexible foundation for the future Superchain.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on maturing the dispute game framework, finalizing the Jovian upgrade, and hardening core components.

**Dispute Game Framework Evolution**
The fault dispute system saw substantial upgrades as it moves towards a more flexible V2 architecture.
-   **V2 Contract Integration:** The `OPContractsManager` was updated to support V2 dispute game contracts for both `addGameType` and `upgrade` functions, enabling a creator pattern for new game implementations ([#17782], [#17874]).
-   **Creator Pattern Migration:** Work began to migrate the `SuperFaultDisputeGame` to the new creator pattern, a key step for making V2 games the default ([#17981]).
-   **Architectural Refinements:** `FaultDisputeGameV2` contracts were modified to pass the game type as an argument rather than in the constructor, allowing a single deployment to be used for multiple game types like cannon and cannon-kona ([#17832]).
-   **Enhanced Testing:** Tests for `OPContractsManager` were updated to correctly handle `disputegame-v2` parameters when the corresponding feature flag is enabled ([#17956]).

**Jovian Hardfork Finalization**
As the Jovian hardfork approaches, the team focused on finalizing its implementation and configuration.
-   **Upgrade Transactions & Validation:** Jovian upgrade transactions were updated ([#17971]), and a bug in `op-node` was fixed to correctly validate Jovian blocks with non-zero `blobGasUsed` values ([#17940]).
-   **Genesis Configuration:** The `L2InitializationConfig` was updated to allow the `MinBaseFee` to be configured at genesis, providing more control for new chain deployments ([#17977]).
-   **Gas Price Oracle Fix:** The `GasPriceOracle` was updated to remove saturating math from the `getOperatorFee` function for Isthmus and Jovian, resolving a previously identified issue ([#17913]).
-   **Feature Flag Removal:** A pull request was opened to remove the feature toggles for Jovian, signaling that the hardfork scope is now settled ([#17978]).

**Smart Contract Security & Refinements**
Security and compatibility of core contracts were improved through several key changes.
-   **SaferSafes Enhancements:** `SaferSafes` contracts now support the IERC165 interface for better introspection ([#17864]). The `TimelockGuard` was also hardened to require that `msgSender` is an owner of the Safe for transaction execution ([#17900]).
-   **Reentrancy Fix:** A potential reentrancy vector in `LivenessModule2` was addressed, and associated natspec documentation was improved for clarity ([#17975]).
-   **Library Upgrade:** Gnosis Safe libraries were upgraded to version 1.4.1 ([#17962]).

**Developer Tooling & Core Infrastructure**
The developer experience and core infrastructure received targeted improvements.
-   **`op-supernode` Publishing:** The `op-supernode` package was added to the scheduled Docker publishing and cross-platform build process, making it more accessible ([#17970]).
-   **`op-devstack` & `op-reth`:** Direct Engine API support for `op-reth` was added to `op-devstack`, enabling proper authentication for local development setups ([#17964]).
-   **`op-batcher` Documentation:** New documentation provides instructions for manually triggering the `op-batcher` to post data, improving operational clarity ([#17967]).

**CI/CD and Testing Infrastructure**
Continuous efforts were made to stabilize and optimize the testing pipeline.
-   **Test Sharding & Parallelism:** Test sharding for `op-e2e` was consolidated at the Makefile level ([#17929], [#17930]), and parallelism for `go-tests` was reduced to optimize CI resource usage ([#17988]).
-   **Cache Management:** `op-deployer` tests were updated to use a temporary cache directory and clean up caches after each run, preventing disk usage issues on runners ([#17965], [#17959]).
-   **Flakiness Reduction:** Several pull requests were dedicated to promoting stable tests and addressing flakiness in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17927], [#17983]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

**Closed Issues**
A significant number of issues were resolved, marking the completion of key workstreams for the Jovian upgrade and Dispute Game V2 integration.
-   **Dispute Game V2:** Issues related to using V2 contracts in `OPCM.upgrade` ([#17258]), `OPCM.addGameType` ([#17260]), and `OPCM.updatePrestate` ([#17261]) were closed as the functionality is now implemented behind feature flags.
-   **Jovian Configuration:** Several issues were closed as Jovian's configuration was finalized, including setting the `daFootprintGasScalar` default ([#773]), adding `minBaseFee` to genesis config ([#17862]), and updating upgrade transaction bytecode ([#772]).
-   **Tooling & Validation:** Older issues related to Kurtosis tooling ([#16975]) and previous validation processes ([#689], [#696]) were closed, reflecting a shift in project priorities and methodologies.

**New & Active Issues**
New issues point to upcoming security work, testing improvements, and ongoing compatibility challenges.
-   **Security Vulnerability:** A new high-priority issue was opened to upgrade the `quic-go` dependency to resolve CVE-2025-59530 ([#17979]).
-   **Jovian Compatibility Blocker:** An active discussion continues on how to handle new fields in the rollup configuration for Jovian without breaking existing zk stacks like `op-succinct` and `kailua` ([#17907]). This represents a key challenge in maintaining ecosystem-wide compatibility.
-   **Future Work & Testing:** New issues were created to matrix Jovian tests across different L1s ([#17980]), ensure the `StandardValidator` supports Cannon Kona games ([#17989]), and migrate the Super DG to the creator pattern ([#17972]), outlining the next steps for major initiatives.
-   **Fusaka Upgrade Prep:** Active issues tracking the preparation of `op-geth` ([#682]) and the absolute prestate update ([#1206]) for the Fusaka upgrade show that work is ongoing for the Mainnet deployment, with the Sepolia phase complete.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week's activity highlighted strong internal coordination on major project goals. The interconnected PRs and issues surrounding the Jovian hardfork and Dispute Game V2 framework demonstrate a focused, multi-pronged effort by the core team. The ongoing discussion in issue [#17907] regarding Jovian's impact on external zk stacks, with mentions of coordinating with other teams, underscores the project's commitment to the broader Superchain ecosystem. Furthermore, the refinement of AI engineering prompts for commit strategies and test quality ([#17950]) indicates an internal focus on scaling and improving development practices.
