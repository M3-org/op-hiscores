# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by intensive preparations for the upcoming Jovian and Fusaka network upgrades. The `min-base-fee` feature, a key component of Jovian, saw its implementation completed and rigorously tested across the stack. Significant effort was also invested in enhancing developer tooling, with major improvements to the `op-deployer`'s reliability and testability. While progress was strong on new features, the team continued to grapple with a persistent flaky test in the acceptance suite, highlighting an ongoing focus on CI stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on protocol upgrades, developer tooling, and testing infrastructure.

- **Jovian & Fusaka Upgrade Preparations:**
  - **`min-base-fee` Feature:** A major focus was the `min-base-fee` functionality. The feature was implemented in the `contracts-bedrock` package ([#17330](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17330)) and followed by the addition of extensive e2e and acceptance tests to ensure its correct behavior ([#17441](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17441)).
  - **Jovian Toggles:** `IsFeature` toggles for Jovian were introduced to enable new functionalities within the rollup attributes and program client ([#17424](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17424)).
  - **Fusaka Planning:** Preparatory work for the Fusaka hardfork began, with new issues opened to prepare `op-node` for derivation changes ([#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17493)), the `op-batcher` for sending cell proofs ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17472)), and to create a new L1 activation test ([#17500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17500)).

- **Developer Tooling & Deployment:**
  - **`op-deployer` Enhancements:** The deployment tool received numerous improvements, including fixes for contract verification ([#17478](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17478], [#17503](
