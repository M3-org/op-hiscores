# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by significant efforts in stabilization, refactoring, and enhancing developer infrastructure. Key progress was made in preparing for Cannon-Kona integration across contracts and tooling. The team also focused heavily on improving the CI/CD pipeline, addressing test flakiness, and optimizing core services like `op-deployer` and `op-batcher`. While no major user-facing features were released, this foundational work strengthens the protocol's robustness, improves developer velocity, and paves the way for future upgrades.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving core components, developer tooling, and preparing for upcoming protocol features.

- **Cannon-Kona Integration:** Progress was made to support the upcoming Cannon-Kona fault proof system. This included a bug fix in `opcm` to correctly set the initial bond during upgrades ([#18100](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18100)), updating the `OPContractsManager.migrate` method to support Cannon-Kona games ([#18078](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18078)), and enabling Cannon-Kona support in contracts via `ForkLive` ([#18110](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18110)).

- **Developer Tooling & CI/CD Enhancements:** The developer experience saw numerous improvements.
    - The `op-deployer` was optimized by speeding up build commands ([#18130](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18130)) and updating its CLI flags ([#18142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18142), [#18143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18143)).
    - The CI pipeline was made more robust by enabling dev flags in upgrade tests for better coverage ([#18133](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18133)), fixing flaky test timeouts ([#18179](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18179)), and adding guidance for interpreting CI failures ([#18127](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18127)).
    - A significant change was made in `op-acceptance-tests` to replace fast games with regular FaultDisputeGames, simplifying the testing setup ([#18152](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18152)).

- **Core Protocol & Service Refinements:**
    - **`op-batcher`:** The batcher underwent a substantial refactoring to remove dead code and streamline its channel management logic without altering behavior ([#18174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18174)).
    - **Rollup Configuration:** The rollup configuration was enhanced with a new optional finality lookback field, providing more flexibility for L2 and L3 chains ([#18071](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18071)).
    - **Code Organization:** The codebase was tidied by moving fork definitions into a new `op-core/forks` package ([#18121](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18121)) and relocating the `predeploys` package to `op-core` ([#18145](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18145)).
    - **Monitoring & Safety:** The `op-dispute-mon` gained new Prometheus metrics to track RPC endpoint errors ([#17622](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17622)), and contract safety was improved by implementing fixes from a SaferSafes audit ([#18147](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18147)).

- **Documentation Initiative:** A coordinated effort to improve documentation was initiated, with a large number of new pull requests opened to enhance various sections of the project's documentation ([#18157-#18171](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+created%3A2025-11-05+label%3Adocs)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:** Key issues were resolved, including the implementation of configurable finalization parameters ([#18009](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18009)) and the completion of tracked changes to the OPCM `migrate` method ([#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17743)). The team also decided to close an older issue for reporting unused acceptance tests, as the move to gateless mode made it less relevant ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16273)).

- **New & Active Issues:** Several critical new issues were opened, highlighting areas for future work:
    - **`op-batcher` Behavior:** The `op-batcher` is a key area of focus. A new issue was opened to improve its throttling controller by incorporating the blob base fee ([#18150](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18150)). Another important issue notes that the batcher does not stay in sync with the `op-node` rollup config after startup, a brittleness that sparked discussion on making the configuration explicit ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18178)).
    - **`op-node` Stability:** Potential issues were identified with `op-node`'s safe head advancement and block rewinding during EL sync, which are being tracked for protocol stability ([#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18124), [#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18125)).
    - **`proxyd` Time Travel:** The long-standing issue of `proxyd` returning old blocks when backends are out of sync ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/501)) saw continued discussion, weighing trade-offs between various solutions like multicall strategies and different forms of sticky sessions.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week saw focused, collaborative efforts on several fronts. A series of related pull requests for `op-node` improvements—covering everything from configuration and metrics to error handling and graceful shutdowns ([#18111-#18117](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+created%3A2025-11-03+author%3Aapp%2Fgithub-actions))—suggests a coordinated push to harden this critical component. Similarly, the large batch of documentation PRs opened on a single day points to a dedicated initiative. Active design discussions on new issues, such as the `op-batcher` config synchronization problem ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18178)), demonstrate healthy, ongoing collaboration in shaping the architecture of core services.
