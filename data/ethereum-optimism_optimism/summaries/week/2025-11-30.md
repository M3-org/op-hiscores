# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Nov 30 - 6, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week saw a significant push in advancing the OP Stack's dispute resolution capabilities, with a flurry of development on the `op-challenger` to support ZK game types. This work included major architectural refactoring and the implementation of core functionalities like challenging, bond reclamation, and game resolution. Concurrently, the team addressed critical stability issues by shipping important bug fixes for the `op-node` and `op-batcher`, resolving sequencer stalls and channel duration problems. The Custom Gas Token feature also matured, moving from a development flag to a system-level feature, while new operational issues concerning `op-node` synchronization have been identified as key areas for investigation.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on enhancing ZK game support, improving network stability, and maturing core protocol features.

- **Advancements in `op-challenger` for ZK Games:** A concentrated effort was made to prepare the `op-challenger` for ZK-based fault proofs.
    - **Architectural Refinements:** The challenger was refactored to be more generic and extensible. This included moving `GameType` to a general package ([#18432](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18432)), removing the `TraceType` concept ([#18433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18433)), introducing a generic `Player` implementation to reduce boilerplate ([#18441](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18441)), and making client providers a shared, service-level concept ([#18440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18440)).
    - **New Functionality:** Core logic for optimistic ZK games was implemented, including the ability to challenge invalid or unsafe proposals ([#18442](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18442), [#18467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18467)), reclaim bonds ([#18465](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18465)), and resolve games ([#18464](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18464)).

- **Node and Batcher Stability Fixes:** Critical bugs affecting network health were resolved.
    - A fix was merged to prevent the `op-node`'s L1 origin selector from getting stuck during reorgs, which previously caused the sequencer to stall ([#18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)).
    - The `op-batcher` received fixes for `MaxChannelDuration` tracking when dealing with large block backlogs, improving its robustness ([#18344](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18344), [#18327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18327)).

- **Core Protocol and Feature Enhancements:**
    - The Custom Gas Token feature was promoted from a development flag to a system feature flag, streamlining its integration and testing ([#18405](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18405)).
    - The `op-supernode` was enhanced with a `superroot_atTimestamp` API activity, introduced as a modular component ([#18180](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18180)).
    - Contract security was improved by enforcing strict pragma usage ([#18390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18390)), and a new script was added to deploy safer safes ([#18448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18448)).

- **Infrastructure and Testing Improvements:**
    - A unified websocket client was introduced to `op-devstack`
