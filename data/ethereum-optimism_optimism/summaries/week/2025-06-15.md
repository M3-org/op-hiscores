# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the stability and developer experience of the OP Stack. Key improvements were made to node components, including a simplification of the `op-batcher` and a new transaction rebroadcasting feature in the transaction manager. Significant effort was dedicated to investigating and debugging stability issues in `op-node` and `op-supervisor`, with new metrics and tests being introduced. Looking forward, the community initiated plans to expand flashblocks support, improve `op-node`'s interop capabilities for simpler configurations, and overhaul CI/CD processes to increase pipeline reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on refining core node components for better efficiency and flexibility.

- **Node Component Enhancements:**
    - The `op-batcher` was simplified by removing the `preferLocalSafeL2` flag, making its behavior more consistent and streamlined ([#16413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16413)).
    - The transaction manager was updated to allow the rebroadcasting of signed transactions without a fee bump, providing more flexible transaction handling strategies ([#16310](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16310)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Discussions this week centered on node stability, testing infrastructure, and developer process improvements.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - A significant milestone was reached with the closure of the issue to enable flashblocks on the `eris-0` testnet ([#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16468)), paving the way for broader testing and adoption.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Node Stability:** Active investigation continues into critical stability issues, including `op-node` getting stuck with thousands of goroutines ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16332)) and `op-supervisor` crashing from event overflows ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16335)). To aid debugging, a PR was proposed to add detailed event counters to the supervisor ([#16473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16473)), and new work was started to fix duplicate event handling ([#16501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16501)) and add consistency testing ([#16518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16518)).
    - **`op-node` Interop Flexibility:** A series of new issues ([#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16519), [#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16520), [#16521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16521)) were opened to explore adding modes to `op-node` that would allow it to handle trivial interop cases without requiring a full `op-supervisor`, simplifying deployments for certain use cases.
    - **Testing & Tooling Expansion:**
        - Building on recent progress, new issues were created to enable flashblocks on `op-sepolia` ([#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16496)) and add flashblocks support to the Kurtosis devnet ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16514)).
        - A new service, `op-sync-tester`, was proposed to facilitate long-range mock EL sync testing without needing a full EL deployment ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16452)).
    - **CI/CD & Release Process:** An active discussion is underway to establish internal SLAs for the CI pipeline ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16437]), with community feedback highlighting concerns around flaky tests and specific metrics. Separately, the conversation on improving release pipelines ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16097)) has shifted towards using `git cliff` for automated changelog generation.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week saw strong collaborative engagement on improving core infrastructure and development processes. The discussion around CI/CD SLAs in issue [#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16437) was particularly active, with developers providing candid feedback on proposed metrics and emphasizing the need to aggressively tackle flaky tests.

The coordinated effort to debug `op-node` and `op-supervisor` stability ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16332), [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16335)) demonstrates a healthy feedback loop between users reporting issues and maintainers responding with targeted diagnostic tools and fixes. Furthermore, the creation of a focused set of issues ([#16519-16521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16519)) for `op-node` interop modes suggests a proactive and collaborative approach to planning future architectural
