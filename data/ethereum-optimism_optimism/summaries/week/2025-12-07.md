# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was marked by a significant push to harden the core protocol and streamline the developer experience. Major features like Jovian, Cannon-Kona, and DisputeGame-V2 were solidified by removing their feature toggles, signaling their transition to default, stable components. Development infrastructure received substantial attention, with numerous improvements to the `op-deployer` tool, CI/CD pipelines, and acceptance testing. However, the discovery of a critical fuzzing vulnerability in `OptimismPortal2` and user-reported node synchronization issues underscore an ongoing focus on system stability and security.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on maturing existing features, improving deployment tooling, and fixing critical bugs.

- **Core Protocol & Contract Maturation:**
  - Feature toggles for the Jovian upgrade ([#17978]), as well as for Cannon-Kona and DisputeGame-V2 ([#18208]), were removed, simplifying the codebase and making these features standard behavior.
  - The `OPContractsManager` (OPCM) was enhanced to allow upgrade-specific allowances for extra instructions ([#18462]), and `OPCMv2` gained support for custom gas tokens ([#18455]), increasing flexibility for future releases.
  - The `SystemConfig` contract was updated to reference the last used OPCM, improving contract management ([#18547]).
  - In a move towards greater transparency, Spearbit's audit report for the revenue sharing feature was added to the repository ([#18103]).

- **Developer Tooling & CI/CD Enhancements:**
  - The `op-deployer` tool was a major focus, receiving updates to support `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrades ([#18580], [#18586]), along with numerous bug fixes for CLI parsing ([#18532], [#18591]) and backported pipeline fixes ([#18539], [#18538]).
  - The CI/CD pipeline was improved by integrating Forge test results for easier debugging ([#18579]) and fixing artifact usage for external pull requests ([#18557]).
  - Acceptance testing infrastructure was bolstered by adding `Kona`, `Rollup-Boost`, and `op-rbuilder` as submodules, automating binary discovery and compilation ([#18540]).

- **Stability and Bug Fixes:**
  - A critical handler leak in the `op-conductor`'s flashblocks implementation was resolved ([#18506]).
  - A fuzzing failure in the `SystemConfig` test was addressed ([#18550]), and the `op-batcher` was improved to exit on critical throttling RPC errors, ensuring more predictable failure modes ([#17924]).
  - Missing commits related to the Custom Gas Token (CGT) feature were integrated, ensuring consistency across the stack ([#18560]).

- **New Feature Foundations:**
  - The initial skeleton for the `op-interop-filter` service was introduced, laying the groundwork for future cross-chain interoperability features ([#18456]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
This week saw the resolution of several feature-related issues, but also the emergence of critical bugs and stability concerns that are now a top priority.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - Key feature finalization tasks were closed, including the removal of Kona/Cannon feature toggles ([#18181]) and the completion of Upgrade 17 release preparations ([#17982]).
  - Stability issues were addressed and closed, including an `op-node` synchronization failure ([#18510]) and an `op-batcher` partial failure mode ([#17768]).
  - Several documentation and operator experience tickets were also resolved ([#1773], [#1874]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Critical Vulnerability:** A high-priority issue ([#18554]) was opened after a fuzzing test revealed a critical bug in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when handling deposits with a null address target. This has been flagged for immediate investigation.
  - **Node Stability:** Multiple users reported node synchronization problems, citing "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors ([#18581]). A separate issue was opened to address P2P connection flakiness between `op-reth` and `op-geth` in system tests ([#18570]), indicating that client interoperability and node stability remain key challenges.
  - **Future Work:** New issues were created to track the finalization of Upgrade 18 ([#18548]), the migration of `kona` and `op-reth` into the monorepo ([#18575], [#18576]), and the need for comprehensive release process documentation ([#18592]).
  - **Active Discussions:** An ongoing discussion around a bug in the `op-node` sequencer recover mode ([#18350]) continues, as does a protocol design discussion on the best way to handle invalid interop transactions and replacement blocks ([#18574]).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week's activity reflects strong internal coordination and engagement with the broader community. The high volume of work on core components like `op-deployer` and the CI/CD pipeline suggests a concerted effort by the core team to improve developer velocity and system reliability.

Discussions on active issues, particularly the node synchronization problems ([#18581]), show a healthy feedback loop where maintainers are actively requesting logs and configuration details from users to diagnose problems. Furthermore, the fix to allow external PRs to use CI artifacts ([#18557]) is a direct investment in making the project more accessible to outside contributors. The expression of interest from a community member to take on an issue ([#17685]) is another positive indicator of community health.
