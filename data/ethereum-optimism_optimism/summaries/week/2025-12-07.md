# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push towards stabilization and tooling maturity. Development focused on solidifying the OP Stack by removing feature toggles for the Jovian upgrade, Cannon-Kona, and DisputeGame-V2, making these features standard. Concurrently, the `op-deployer` tool received substantial updates to support the upcoming `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrade, enhancing deployment capabilities. The team also invested heavily in CI/CD reliability and testing infrastructure, addressing fuzzing failures, improving acceptance tests, and beginning foundational work on the `op-interop-filter` service for future cross-chain functionality.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on maturing the core protocol, enhancing deployment tooling, and improving test infrastructure.

**Core Protocol Maturation & Feature Flag Removal**
The codebase was streamlined as recent major features became standard. The Jovian feature toggles were removed as its scope is now fixed ([#17978]), and feature flags for `cannon-kona` and `disputegame-v2` were also removed, making them default behaviors ([#18208], [#18588]). This simplifies the protocol and deployment process.

**Deployment and Tooling Enhancements**
The `op-deployer` was a major focus, with several updates preparing for the `op-contracts/v5.0.0` upgrade ([#18580], [#18585], [#18586]). Its testing capabilities were improved by adding support for Docker and GitHub binaries ([#18551]), and a critical bug in the `add_game_type` CLI parsing was fixed to prevent erroneous exits ([#18532], [#18591]).

**Contract and Interoperability Improvements**
The `OPContractsManager` (OPCM) was enhanced to allow upgrade-specific allowances for extra instructions ([#18462]), and `OPCMv2` gained support for custom gas tokens ([#18455]). To improve contract management, `SystemConfig` was updated to store a reference to the last used OPCM ([#18547]). Foundational work began on the `op-interop-filter` service, with the introduction of its CLI skeleton and metrics ([#18456]). For transparency, a revenue sharing audit report was also added ([#18103]).

**CI/CD and Testing Infrastructure**
Significant effort was dedicated to improving the development pipeline. This included adding `kona`, `rollup-boost`, and `op-rbuilder` as submodules for acceptance testing ([#18540]), fixing flaky Slack notifications ([#18542]), and ensuring external PRs can use CI artifacts correctly ([#18557]). The AI contract test maintenance system was improved to prevent infinite loops ([#18601]), and CI was configured to generate XML results for Forge tests, enhancing developer feedback ([#18579]).

**Critical Bug Fixes**
Several important bugs were resolved. A fuzzing failure in the `SystemConfig` test was fixed ([#18550]), and flashblocks handler leaks in `op-conductor` were resolved to improve stability ([#18506]). Missing Custom Gas Token (CGT) commits were also integrated to ensure correct contract test behavior ([#18560]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

**Closed Issues**
Several critical issues were resolved this week, enhancing system stability and marking the completion of major project milestones:
-   **Node Stability:** A critical `op-node` v1.16.3 synchronization failure was resolved ([#18510]), and the `op-batcher` was updated to shut down fully on critical RPC errors, enabling automatic recovery ([#17768]).
-   **Upgrade Finalization:** The task for finalizing Upgrade 17 releases and governance preparations was completed ([#17982]).
-   **Feature Integration:** The issue tracking the removal of feature toggles for Kona and Cannon was closed, confirming their integration into the main codebase ([#18181]).

**New & Active Issues**
Discussions this week highlighted key areas of future work and immediate concern:
-   **Critical Fuzzing Failure:** A new critical issue was opened for a fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when handling the zero address, indicating a potential security vulnerability ([#18554]).
-   **Node Synchronization Problems:** A significant active issue involves users reporting that nodes are failing to synchronize, encountering "missing trie node" errors ([#18581]). This suggests potential issues with state provision from L1 execution clients and is a blocker for node operators.
-   **Monorepo Migration:** A series of tracking issues were created to manage the migration of Rust crates like `kona` and `op-reth` into the main monorepo ([#18575], [#18576], [#18577]), signaling a major architectural initiative.
-   **Protocol Design Debates:** An active discussion is underway regarding the design of injected replacement transactions for the interop system, weighing protocol simplicity against the needs of the proof system ([#18574]). Another deep discussion continues on a potential bug in `op-node`'s sequencer recover mode that could stall derivation ([#18350]).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week saw active collaboration on both high-level design and low-level bug fixing. The detailed discussions on the interop system ([#18574]) and the sequencer recover mode bug ([#18350]) demonstrate deep engagement from core developers in refining the protocol. There were also positive signs of broader community involvement, with contributors expressing interest in taking on tasks related to the `op-rbuilder` healthcheck ([#17685]) and batcher code simplification ([#18479]). The team's focus on improving the developer experience was evident in the fix to allow external pull requests to better utilize CI artifacts ([#18557]), fostering a more inclusive contribution environment.
