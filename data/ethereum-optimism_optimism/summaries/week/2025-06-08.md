# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Jun 8 - 14, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the robustness of the OP Stack and improving developer infrastructure. Key progress was made in preparing for future network upgrades with added support for v4.0.0 in `op-deployer`. Significant work was also done to improve the resilience of core components, including `op-batcher`'s sync detection and `op-node`'s reorg handling. However, the week also saw the emergence of critical new stability concerns, with reports of goroutine leaks in `op-node` and event overflow issues in `op-supervisor`. A major ongoing focus remains on tackling CI and acceptance test flakiness to improve development velocity and reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on bolstering the core stack's stability, preparing for future upgrades, and adding new administrative capabilities.

-   **Stack Robustness and Upgrade Preparedness:**
    -   To prepare for future network upgrades, `op-deployer` was updated to support the validation and deployment of v4.0.0 configurations ([#16048]).
    -   `op-batcher`'s stability was improved with a more robust method for detecting "not yet ready" sync statuses, preventing issues from incomplete L2 data ([#16298]).
    -   `op-node`'s handling of L1 reorgs was optimized by modifying its unsafe head search to work backwards during supervisor-instructed resets ([#16312]).

-   **New Proposer Functionality:**
    -   A new `admin_propose` RPC method was added to `op-proposer`, providing an administrative interface for controlling the proposal process ([#16408]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
This week saw the resolution of dependency and documentation issues, but also the emergence of critical new stability reports and a continued, concerted effort to address test flakiness.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   A dependency issue causing import errors due to a missing `dist` directory in `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` was resolved ([#1146]).
    -   An issue regarding outdated documentation for the deprecated `L2OutputOracleProxy` was closed, clarifying its status for developers ([#1614]).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Critical Stability Concerns:** Two significant issues were reported:
        -   `op-node` v1.13.3 is experiencing a critical issue where thousands of goroutines become stuck, leading to sync failures over time ([#16332]).
        -   `op-supervisor` is reportedly entering a non-recoverable crash-loop due to event overflow when the unsafe head gap with a managed node becomes too large ([#16335]).
    -   **CI & Test Reliability:** A major focus of the week was investigating and improving CI reliability. Discussions in [#16271] and [#16378] centered on identifying the top flaky tests and infrastructure-related failures. A new "Flakiness Report" was introduced to provide better debugging clues.
    -   **Developer Experience & Tooling:**
        -   A bug report highlighted insufficient documentation for developers implementing custom bridges following recent interop updates ([#16331]).
        -   A long-standing issue regarding an incorrect nonce returned by `eth_getTransactionCount` ([#623]) continues to see community members asking for updates.
        -   New proposals were opened to improve clarity by renaming supervisor-node modes ([#16379]) and to establish monitoring for flashblocks integration ([#16388]).
    -   **Future Work & Refactoring:**
        -   A detailed plan of action was outlined for the Fault Proof creator contract OPCM changes ([#15789]).
        -   A new PR proposes to decouple `AnchorStateRegistry` from `SystemConfig` for a more modular architecture ([#16383]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was prominent in tackling complex technical challenges and refining development processes. The active discussions around CI flakiness ([#16271], [#16378]) and the `op-supervisor` event overflow issue ([#16335]) involved multiple team members working together to diagnose root causes and propose solutions. The introduction of a PR review policy proposal ([#16339]) signals a move towards more formalized and mature contribution guidelines. Furthermore, the continued engagement from the community on long-standing issues like the incorrect nonce bug ([#623]) underscores the importance of addressing user-facing problems.
