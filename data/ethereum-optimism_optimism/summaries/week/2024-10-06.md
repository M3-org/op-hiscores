# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Oct 6 - 12, 2024)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's focus was on architectural planning to address a critical scalability bottleneck within the Superchain's upgrade process. A key discussion emerged around the need to refactor fault proof contracts to support `Creator` contracts, a change aimed at significantly reducing deployment costs and enabling more efficient, batched upgrades across the growing number of L2 chains. This strategic effort underscores the project's commitment to improving the long-term maintainability and scalability of the Superchain ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no new features or pull requests were merged this week, development efforts were concentrated on strategic planning and architectural design. The primary focus was on addressing the inefficiencies in the current dispute game contract deployment process, as detailed in the issues section below.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week's activity was centered on identifying and defining a crucial piece of future work related to protocol scalability.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  The most significant development was the opening of issue [#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421), which highlights a major bottleneck for Superchain upgrades.
    - **Problem:** The current fault proof contracts contain immutables, requiring a full, costly redeployment for each new L2 chain. With deployment costs ranging from 3-5 million gas per contract, this severely limits the number of chains that can be upgraded in a single transaction.
    - **Proposed Solution:** The issue proposes refactoring the dispute game contracts to remove these immutables, allowing for a shared implementation across all chains. This would streamline the upgrade process and is a necessary step for scaling the Superchain.
    - **Context:** This work is a continuation of previous efforts, such as the refactoring of the `AnchorStateRegistry`. Discussion on the issue indicates it is being re-prioritized due to its high impact on upgrade efficiency.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was focused on high-level architectural strategy. The discussion around issue [#12421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/12421) and updates to a related design document ([design-docs/pull/275](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/275)) show a coordinated effort to tackle foundational challenges. This indicates a proactive approach to ensuring the protocol's architecture can support the continued growth of the Superchain.
