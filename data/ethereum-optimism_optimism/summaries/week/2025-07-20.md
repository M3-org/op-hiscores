# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development was characterized by significant performance enhancements to the `op-batcher`, a major push to improve testing infrastructure, and extensive planning for the rollout of "flashblocks" functionality. Key achievements include reducing the batcher's memory footprint and introducing advanced data availability throttling. The team also made substantial progress in clearing technical debt by closing a large volume of issues related to interoperability and the `op-supervisor`, while simultaneously streamlining contract deployment scripts and improving test quality across the stack.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This section details the concrete work completed, grouped by theme.

### `op-batcher` Performance and Throttling
A primary focus this week was on optimizing the `op-batcher` for better memory efficiency, throughput, and operational control.
- **Memory and Throughput:** The batcher's memory usage was massively reduced by discarding the channel compressor after frame generation ([#16597](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16597)). It will also now start publishing sooner when processing a backlog, improving throughput during restarts ([#16648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16648)).
- **Data Availability (DA) Throttling:** Advanced throttling controls were introduced, offering multiple strategies for more flexible DA management ([#16588](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16588)). The batcher was also updated to consistently use blobs while throttling, preventing an unintended fallback to calldata ([#16773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16773)).
- **Operational Visibility:** The maximum throttle threshold was made more visible in logs and APIs to improve transparency ([#16804](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16804)).

### Testing Infrastructure and Quality
Significant effort was invested in improving the speed, capability, and quality of the project's testing frameworks.
- **Test Performance:** `op-acceptance-tests` were sped up by optimizing Forge build steps and enabling intelligent rebuilds ([#16784](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16784)). The tests were also updated to `v1.1.1` ([#16802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16802)).
- **New Test Tooling:** Scaffolding for a new `op-sync-tester` was introduced, including session handling and configuration loading ([#16780](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16780)).
- **Fault Proof Testing:** `cannon` fault tests were migrated to the `DiffTester` framework, enhancing post-step checks ([#16767](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16767), [#16787](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16787)).
- **Test Refinements:** Test coverage for `L1StandardBridge` and `L1ERC721Bridge` was improved through refactoring ([#16772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16772)), and a bug in the OPCM test suite was fixed ([#16813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16813)).

### Contract Deployment and Refinement
Work was done to clean up and streamline deployment scripts for Bedrock contracts, improving clarity and maintainability. This involved removing redundant or unnecessary assertions for the system config ([#16585](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16585)), `l1standardbridge` ([#16715](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16715)), `l1erc721bridge` ([#16716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16716)), dispute game factory ([#16717](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16717)), optimism mintable erc20 factory ([#16719](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16719)), and other contracts like the Optimism Portal and OPCM ([#16819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16819)).

### Interoperability and Monitoring
- The `op-e2e` suite was updated to support blob DA types for the interop supersystem, a key step for fault proof testing ([#16788](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16788)).
- The `dispute-mon` tool was enhanced to support multiple supervisor RPCs, improving its reliability ([#16517](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16517)).
- A new flag was added to the `op-node` to allow operators to configure the gossip timestamp threshold for rejecting old payloads ([#16718](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16718)).

### Security and Documentation
- Two new Spearbit security review reports from May and July 2025 were added to the documentation, covering the Upgrade 16 and VerifyOPCM reviews ([#16737](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16737)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
A significant number of issues were closed, indicating a concerted effort to resolve technical debt and finalize features.
- **Interop and Supervisor:** A large batch of issues related to `op-supervisor` readiness, RPC improvements, testnet recovery, and reorg handling were closed, marking progress on interop functionality ([#15702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15702), [#15755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15755), [#15757](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15757), [#15758](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15758), [#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16314)).

- **Runbook Finalization:** The Fault Proof Incident Runbook v3 was finalized and the "draft" label removed ([#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16651)).

### New & Active Issues
- **Flashblocks Rollout:** A series of new issues meticulously outlines the phased deployment and testing strategy for "flashblocks." This includes enabling it on a single mainnet sequencer ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16759]), load testing ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16756)), and deploying necessary infrastructure like proxies and RPC nodes ([#16763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16763), [#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16764)).
- **Future Protocol Work:** New tracking issues were created for major future initiatives, including Execution Multiplexing ([#16809](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16809)) and the implementation of a Minimum Base Fee ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16807)).
- **Active Discussion:** An active discussion on issue [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16388) focuses on defining specific metrics and alerting for the flashblocks integration, covering everything from peer counts and block progression to RPC node health.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week demonstrated strong internal coordination, particularly in the comprehensive planning for the flashblocks rollout, which was detailed across numerous interconnected issues. The large-scale closure of interop and `op-supervisor` issues suggests a successful, focused effort by the team to prepare for the next phase of development. An interesting collaborative note was the use of AI assistance to refactor and improve L1 bridge test coverage ([#16772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16772)). The detailed, cross-functional discussion around flashblocks monitoring metrics highlights proactive collaboration to ensure a smooth and observable deployment.
