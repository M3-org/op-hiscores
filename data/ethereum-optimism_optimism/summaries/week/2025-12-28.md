# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Dec 28 - 3, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development activity focused on proactive stability improvements and feature enhancements, with no major features merged. Significant new proposals were introduced to bolster the `conductor` and `op-batcher` components by addressing race conditions, nil pointers, and adding new RPC functionalities. Preparatory work for future protocol adjustments was also initiated, including the removal of L2OO support and setting a new default fault-proof game type. A notable event was a disputed critical vulnerability report, which was closed by maintainers but contested by the reporter, highlighting ongoing security vigilance.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
No pull requests were merged or completed during this reporting period. The team's efforts were concentrated on proposing and refining new work, as detailed below.

### Proposed Changes & New Work
A flurry of new pull requests were opened, signaling a focus on system robustness and future-proofing the protocol:

*   **Conductor Enhancements:** A series of proposals aim to improve the control and stability of the `conductor`. These include adding a `demote-voter` RPC command ([#18700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18700)), introducing a raft configuration to prevent shutdown on removal ([#18699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18699)), and implementing round-robin leadership transfer to fix the leader loop ([#18697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18697)).
*   **`op-batcher` Stability:** To harden the `op-batcher`, two key fixes were proposed. [#18702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18702) addresses a potential race condition in the `receiptsLoop`, while [#18701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18701) targets a potential nil pointer dereference.
*   **Protocol & Contract Adjustments:** Work has begun on several forward-looking changes. These include a proposal to remove L2OO support ([#18706](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18706)), a change to set the default respected game type to CANNON_KONA ([#18705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18705)), and a PR to test an OPCMv2 upgrade ([#18704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18704)). Additionally, [#18696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18696) was opened to improve test coverage for the `OptimismMintableERC20` contract.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
### Closed Issues
*   A critical vulnerability report ([#18703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18703)) was closed with a 'Not Live' status. However, the reporter disputes this, claiming the vulnerability is active on Mainnet and has offered to provide a reproduction script privately.

### New & Active Issues
*   **Data Availability Configuration:** A user opened issue [#18698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18698) seeking clarification on whether running `op-batcher` with `--data-availability-type=callData` removes the need for an L1 beacon client configuration, highlighting a potential point of confusion for node operators.
*   **Tutorial Execution Error:** The long-standing issue [#1919](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1919), related to an error in the `create-l2-rollup-example` tutorial, received a new comment from a user experiencing the same "fee vault set to zero address" problem, indicating this remains a hurdle for new developers.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was visible through issue reporting and discussion. The dialogue around the disputed vulnerability report in [#18703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18703) represents a critical, albeit tense, interaction between a security researcher and the project maintainers. Furthermore, the new comment on the tutorial issue [#1919](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1919) and the configuration question in [#18698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18698) demonstrate active community participation in identifying and clarifying technical challenges.
