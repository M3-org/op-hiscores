# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Dec 29 - 4, 2024)

## üöÄ Highlights
This was a quiet period focused on forward-looking protocol design rather than active code development. The primary activity involved strategic planning around consensus mechanisms, highlighted by the creation of a new tracking issue. This issue proposes adding a nonce to specific L1 events to enhance protocol robustness, indicating a continued focus on long-term security and stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, there were no new features, bug fixes, or other code-level changes merged during this timeframe.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project's issue tracker saw minimal activity, with the focus on planning for future enhancements.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.
- **New & Active Issues:** A single new tracking issue, [#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13543), was opened. It proposes monitoring the implementation of a nonce for L1 events that influence consensus, specifically `SystemConfig.ConfigUpdate` and `OptimismPortal2.Transact`. This suggests planning for future protocol improvements, although the report notes this specific implementation was not prioritized for the immediate future.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development activity was minimal, with no new pull requests or significant discussions on issues reported. This indicates a period of low collaborative activity, typical of holiday seasons or times of strategic planning between implementation cycles.
