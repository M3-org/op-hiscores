# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Feb 2 - 8, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the stability and efficiency of core protocol components. A significant architectural discussion was initiated to deprecate the `req-resp` P2P sync protocol in `op-node` in favor of a simpler, more robust mechanism to address ongoing sync issues. Concurrently, a critical bug in `op-proposer` related to transaction creation failures was resolved, restoring key functionality for the dispute game system. The overall theme was a focus on protocol reliability through both immediate fixes and long-term architectural planning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features or pull requests were merged this week. Development activity was concentrated on resolving existing issues and planning future architectural changes, as detailed in the sections below.

## üêõ Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
A key operational issue was resolved, improving the stability of the proposal mechanism:
- **`op-proposer` Transaction Creation Failure:** An issue where `op-proposer` failed to create transactions ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13502)) was closed. The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration, specifically passing an incorrect `game-type` or having an improperly configured contract. The resolution ensures the dispute game system functions as expected.

### New & Active Issues
A major new issue was opened, sparking discussion around a significant change to the node synchronization process:
- **Deprecation of `req-resp` P2P Sync:** A proposal was opened ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14108)) to remove the `req-resp` P2P sync protocol from `op-node`. This change aims to solve persistent sync problems.
- **Alternative Sync Mechanism Discussion:** The discussion on [#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14108) revolves around an alternative unsafe block sync mechanism. The proposed alternative is noted as being simpler and more cost-effective, avoiding the complexities and networking challenges of the current UDP-based protocol. It is designed to be faster for syncing small block ranges and less prone to race conditions, improving overall node stability and convergence speed.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's collaboration was characterized by deep technical discussions on architectural improvements. The conversation around the `op-node` sync protocol in issue [#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14108) highlighted a prototype developed by community member @emilianobonassi, demonstrating a collaborative approach to solving core infrastructure challenges. The activity indicates a focus on strategic planning and problem-solving among core contributors.
