# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant overhaul of the project's testing infrastructure, aimed at improving robustness and developer velocity. Major efforts were made to unify acceptance tests into a single workflow, migrate existing tests to Devstack, and enhance the `op-sync-tester` with external network capabilities. Alongside testing improvements, core protocol components received key updates, including the introduction of feature flagging in `SystemConfig`. The team also closed a remarkable number of long-standing issues related to Drippie, Cannon, and past protocol stages, clearing technical debt and marking the completion of major initiatives.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on bolstering testing frameworks, enhancing core protocol flexibility, and improving the developer workflow.

### Testing Infrastructure Overhaul
A concerted effort was made to streamline, centralize, and expand test coverage, resulting in a more robust and efficient testing environment.
- **Acceptance Test Unification:** All acceptance tests were consolidated into a single, dedicated workflow, moving them out of general unit test runs to improve organization and efficiency ([#16755], [#16817]).
- **Devstack Migration:** Key test suites, including Fjord (Holocene) and critical smoke tests, were successfully ported to the Devstack environment, enhancing end-to-end testing capabilities ([#16920], [#17300]).
- **`op-sync-tester` Enhancements:** The sync tester was significantly improved by adding read-only Execution Layer access ([#17275]), full support for the `sync` namespace for session management ([#17299]), and integration with external ELs for more realistic testing scenarios ([#17251]).

### Core Component and Protocol Enhancements
Several components of the OP Stack received important updates to increase configurability and prepare for future upgrades.
- **Feature Flagging:** The `SystemConfig` contract was updated to support feature flagging, allowing for the controlled rollout of new protocol features by the ProxyAdmin ([#17281]).
- **Fault Proof Configuration:** The `op-challenger` now includes configurable response delays, providing more flexibility for testing fault proof game interactions ([#16988]).
- **Deployment Flexibility:** The `op-deployer` was improved to allow custom gas limits to be set for chains in intent files, offering more control during deployment ([#17271]).
- **Dependency Management:** The `op-geth` dependency was updated to `v1.16.2` ([#17228]).

### CI/CD and Developer Experience
The development process was streamlined through several key changes.
- The frozen file check was removed from the CI pipeline to accelerate progress on the `develop` branch ([#17289]).
- The `publish-cannon-prestates` CI job was migrated to a more reliable environment to address network flakiness ([#17296]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a major cleanup of the issue tracker, resolving numerous historical items while also identifying new challenges and planning for future work.

### Closed Issues
A significant number of long-standing issues were closed, marking the completion of several major workstreams:
- **Project Milestones:** The shipping checklist for Stage 1.4 ([#15827]) was completed.
- **Drippie Automation:** A series of issues related to the deployment and operationalization of Drippie for managing challenger funds were closed, including mainnet deployment and dashboard integration ([#12876], [#13764], [#14048]).
- **Cannon VM:** Key issues for the Cannon fault proof VM were resolved, including adding full `mips64r2` ISA support ([#13969]) and scaling the VM runner ([#16910]).
- **Bug Fixes & Housekeeping:** An `op-proposer` error was resolved ([#17042]), and an old `op-geth` initialization error was closed ([#420]). The effort to unify acceptance tests also closed its primary tracking issue ([#16272]).

### New & Active Issues
Discussions this week centered on a critical new bug and preparations for upcoming protocol features.
- **`op-node` P2P Bug:** A significant bug was reported where `ConfigureGossip` in `op-node` overwrites sane defaults with zero values, leading to panics ([#17308]). This has sparked an active discussion on the best approach for setting default configurations to prevent such issues.
- **Aggregate Dispute Game Design:** A new issue ([#17305]) was opened to begin the initial design for an aggregate dispute game, signaling the start of research and development for the next generation of fault proofs.
- **Kona Upgrade Preparation:** Discussions are ongoing to ensure all stack components are prepared for the Kona + Cannon game types. This includes verifying support in `OPContractsManager` ([#17285]), `op-dispute-mon` ([#17286]), and standard prestates ([#17283]).
- **Test Stability:** New issues were opened to address flakiness in acceptance tests ([#17298]) and ensure action tests are passing for the upcoming Jovian hardfork ([#17302], [#17303]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong, focused collaboration within the development team. The coordinated, multi-PR effort to overhaul the acceptance testing framework demonstrates a shared commitment to improving engineering quality and velocity. Furthermore, the detailed discussion on the `op-node` gossip bug ([#17308]) between team members shows a healthy, in-depth process for diagnosing complex issues and debating the merits of different solutions. The closure of a large volume of historical issues suggests a collective push to finalize past workstreams, clearing the path for the team to focus on future priorities like the Kona upgrade and aggregate dispute games.
