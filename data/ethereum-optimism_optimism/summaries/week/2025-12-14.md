# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on advancing the fault proof system and laying foundational groundwork for enhanced Superchain interoperability. Key progress was made in fault proof testing with the successful integration of the Jovian fork for precompile tests. New development began on core interop filtering logic and the addition of provable output roots, signaling a push towards more robust cross-chain functionality. While development progressed, several critical bugs were identified, including an `op-challenger` panic and a fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2`, highlighting an ongoing focus on system security and stability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving the robustness of the proof system, enhancing node reliability, and preparing for future interoperability features.

- **Fault Proof System Enhancements:**
  - A significant step was taken to improve fault proof testing by enabling the Jovian hard fork for proofs precompile tests within the `op-e2e` framework ([#18606](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18606)).
  - To support these tests, the Kona client version used for proofs was updated ([#18611](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18611)).
  - Foundational work began on adding provable output roots to super DGs, a key component for future proof mechanisms ([#18605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18605)).

- **Node & Service Reliability:**
  - The `op-node` light client was improved to consistently use the Consensus Layer (CL) as its source, enhancing synchronization reliability ([#18571](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18571)).
  - A `SafeRename` utility was added to `op-service/ioutil` to prevent file renaming errors encountered by the GitHub release binary provider ([#18610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18610)).

- **Superchain Interoperability Foundations:**
  - A new pull request was opened to implement core filtering logic for interoperation, a crucial piece of the Superchain vision ([#18604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18604)).

- **CI/CD & Repository Health:**
  - The CI pipeline was upgraded with `mise` for caching and retries, aiming for more efficient and reliable builds ([#18572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18572)).
  - A proposal was made to remove compiled binaries from the repository to streamline its contents ([#18607](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18607)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The community was active in identifying and discussing critical issues, with a focus on bugs affecting core components and design considerations for future features.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - The primary issue closed was [#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17348), marking the successful implementation of precompile fault proof tests on the Jovian fork.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Critical Bugs:** Several high-priority issues emerged that could impact stability and security:
    - **`op-challenger` Panic:** A critical bug was reported where `op-challenger` panics when connected to an L1 client that doesn't support `blobBaseFee` ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18608)).
    - **`OptimismPortal2` Fuzzing Failure:** A fuzzing test is failing in `OptimismPortal2.depositTransaction` when the target is a null address, indicating a potential logic error ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18554)).
    - **P2P Flakiness:** Ongoing investigation into flaky P2P connections between `op-reth` and `op-geth` in system tests continues to be a major concern ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18570)).
    - **Node Sync Errors:** A user reported "missing trie node" errors, suggesting issues with the L1 Execution Client providing state data to the Op-Node ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581)).
  - **Future Work & Design:**
    - New issues were created to update client libraries to use timestamps for withdrawal proofs ([#18614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18614)) and to adapt the prove withdrawals script to use output roots ([#18615](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18615)), aligning with the new work on provable roots.
    - Active discussions continue on optimizing ZK Proofs by offloading expensive operations in `kona-sp1` ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18533)) and on the protocol design for handling invalid interop transactions ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week's activity demonstrates tight coordination between development and planning. The introduction of a new feature for provable output roots ([#18605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18605)) was immediately followed by the creation of issues ([#18614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18614), [#18615](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18615)) to integrate this change across the stack, indicating strong alignment. Furthermore, the detailed bug reports and deep technical discussions in active issues like [#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18554) (fuzzing failure) and [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18533) (ZK proof optimization) reflect a highly engaged and technically proficient community dedicated to the project's long-term health and security.
