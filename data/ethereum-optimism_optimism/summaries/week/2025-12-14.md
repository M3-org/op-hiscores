# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the robustness of the fault proof system and core node infrastructure. Key progress was made by enabling the Jovian hard fork for precompile tests and improving the `op-node`'s light client synchronization. However, a critical issue was discovered where the `op-challenger` panics when connected to an L1 node that does not support blobs, highlighting a significant compatibility challenge. Concurrently, new initiatives were launched to implement core filtering logic for interoperability and to add provable output roots to dispute games, signaling a continued push towards a more secure and interconnected Superchain.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this period centered on strengthening existing systems and initiating new feature development.

- **Fault Proof System Enhancements:** The fault proof system was significantly updated to improve testing and compatibility. The Jovian hard fork was enabled for precompile fault proof tests ([#18606](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18606)), and the pinned Kona client version was updated ([#18611](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18611)), ensuring the test environment aligns with modern network features.

- **Node & Deployment Reliability:** To improve stability, the `op-node`'s light client was modified to always follow its source using the Consensus Layer (CL), ensuring more consistent synchronization ([#18571](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18571)). A `SafeRename` utility was also introduced to enhance the reliability of deployment processes ([#18610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18610)).

- **CI/CD Improvements:** The continuous integration pipeline was made more efficient and resilient through the addition of improved caching and automatic retries ([#18572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18572)).

- **New Initiatives (Work in Progress):** Several new pull requests signal the start of important new work. Development has begun on core filtering logic for `op-interop-filter` ([#18604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18604)) and adding provable output roots to super dispute games ([#18605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18605)). Other new efforts include improving test coverage for `AdminFaucetAuthModule` ([#18609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18609)) and removing compiled binaries from the repository to improve hygiene ([#18607](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18607)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:** The primary issue closed was [#17348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17348), which tracked the successful effort to enable the Jovian hard fork for precompile fault proof tests.

- **New & Active Issues:** A critical bug was reported in [#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18608), where `op-challenger` panics with a `nil pointer dereference` if the L1 client does not support `blobBaseFee`. This poses a compatibility risk with pre-Dencun L1s, and discussion is leaning towards adding a configuration flag to prevent this behavior.

  Several other significant issues are under active discussion:
    - **Critical Bugs:** A fuzzing test failure in `OptimismPortal2` when `_7702Target` is `address(0)` ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18554)) and P2P connection flakiness between `op-reth` and `op-geth` in system tests ([#18570](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18570)) are being treated as high-priority items.
    - **Node Synchronization:** Users continue to report `missing trie node` errors ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581)), with maintainers actively requesting detailed logs and configurations to diagnose the problem.
    - **Design & Optimization:** There is an ongoing technical debate regarding the necessity of an injected replacement transaction for invalid interop actions ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574)), with the current consensus favoring its importance for the proof system.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The active issues list reveals a high degree of collaboration. There is clear engagement between maintainers and users on debugging node synchronization problems ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581)). Deep technical discussions on topics like interop transaction design ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18574)) and ZK proof optimization ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18533)) show active involvement from core developers in architectural decisions. The rapid identification and triage of critical bugs like the `op-challenger` panic ([#18608](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18608)) and the fuzzing failure ([#18554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18554)) demonstrate a community that is responsive and focused on maintaining protocol security and stability.
