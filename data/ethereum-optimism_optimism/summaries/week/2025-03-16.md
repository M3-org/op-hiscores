# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Mar 16 - 22, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This was a quiet week for code contributions, with development activity centered on planning and identifying areas for improvement. The primary focus was on enhancing the developer experience, particularly at the intersection of Go and Solidity. The EVM Safety team initiated a key discussion by opening an issue to address friction in the development workflow, signaling a future focus on tooling and efficiency for engineers building on the OP Stack.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
There were no new features, bug fixes, or other code changes merged during this period. The project's development activity was focused on issue triage and planning rather than implementation.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week's activity was concentrated on defining future work through the issue tracker.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:** A significant new issue, [#14976](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14976), was opened to improve the developer experience for those working with both Go and Solidity. The proposal aims to reduce friction by automatically updating Go structs when Solidity contracts are modified and exploring the replacement of input/output contracts with native Solidity structs. No other issues saw significant discussion.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was internal and forward-looking. The EVM Safety team's initiative in opening issue [#14976](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14976) highlights a proactive approach to improving internal development processes. There was no significant public discussion on pull requests or issues, indicating a period of focused planning within the core team.
