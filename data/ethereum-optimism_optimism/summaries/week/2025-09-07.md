# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push to stabilize and enhance the Superchain's core infrastructure. Major progress was made in maturing the testing and CI/CD pipeline, with new sync tests using real-world data from OP Sepolia and mainnet now running in CI. The team successfully closed out a large body of work related to Flashblocks deployment and monitoring, marking a key milestone. Concurrently, development on future upgrades continued with a major refactor of the Optimism Protocol Contracts Manager (OPCM) for the upcoming U17 release and enhancements to the dispute game system for Kona support. A notable strategic shift occurred with the formal deprioritization of numerous Kurtosis-related development efforts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on strengthening core protocol contracts, improving testing infrastructure, and fixing critical bugs across the stack.

-   **Superchain Configuration & Contract Upgrades:**
    -   A major upgrade was merged to prepare the Optimism Protocol Contracts Manager (OPCM) for the U17 release, which involved removing U16 code and improving maintainability ([#17406]).
    -   A bug in `superchainConfig` upgrade logic was fixed to ensure proper version comparison ([#16838]).
    -   To support migrating chain-specific configurations, a new `PermissionedDisputeGameV2` contract was introduced ([#17290]).
    -   The `StandardValidator` was improved to retrieve implementation versions directly from contracts, reducing bytecode size ([#17377]).

-   **Kona & Dispute Game Enhancements:**
    -   The `op-challenger` was updated to support `cannon-kona` trace functionality and fix metric labels for `asterisc-kona` deployments ([#17356], [#17367]). Corresponding `CANNON_KONA` and `SUPER_ASTERISC_KONA` game types were added to the contracts ([#17358]).
    -   The `op-dispute-mon` tool was enhanced to support monitoring `cannon-kona` games ([#17380]).
    -   The `op-devstack` environment for Kona was updated to reflect changes in log level and format ([#17370]) and to expose the `UserRPC` endpoint for better restart capabilities ([#17390]).

-   **Testing Infrastructure & CI/CD:**
    -   A significant enhancement was made to `op-acceptance-tests` by adding new `op-node` upgrade tests that utilize `op-sync-tester` and real-world data from OP Sepolia to validate hardforks ([#17363]).
    -   The CI pipeline was strengthened by enabling OPM and Base mainnet `op-node` sync tests, complete with Slack notifications for failures ([#17393]).
    -   The `op-e2e` testing framework was refactored to use the `ActivateForkAtOffset` utility, simplifying future fork activation tests ([#17362]).
    -   Acceptance tests were improved to properly wait for fund balances in persistent devnets ([#17397]).

-   **Core Component Bug Fixes & Maintenance:**
    -   A critical fix was applied to `op-node` to skip L1 genesis hash checks when the block is unavailable, addressing issues with pruned L1 nodes ([#17407]).
    -   A version loop issue in `op-program` was resolved to correctly handle tags with spaces ([#17360]).
    -   The `op-conductor`'s p2p healthcheck was corrected to use the request context properly ([#17294]).
    -   `op-geth` was bumped to include new Superchain registry configurations for the `arena-z-sepolia` isthmus hardfork ([#17437]).
    -   A new pull request was opened to tighten directory permissions for file-backed KV stores, enhancing security ([#17354]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Flashblocks Stabilization:** A large number of issues related to the deployment, monitoring, and alerting for Flashblocks on mainnet were closed, indicating the successful completion of this initiative ([#16759], [#16760], [#16388], [#17162]).
    -   **Kurtosis Deprioritization:** A strategic decision was made to deprioritize Kurtosis-related work, leading to the closure of numerous issues, including those for genesis checks, performance improvements, and adding Kurtosis support to `op-validator` ([#15753], [#14390], [#16712]).
    -   **Testing Milestones:** The first milestone for the `op-sync-tester` was achieved with the closure of the issue tracking the addition of sync acceptance tests ([#16703]). Several older smoke test issues were also closed as no longer required ([#140], [#141], [#142], [#143]).
    -   **Geth Merge:** The issue tracking the Geth v1.16.2 merge was closed, marking its completion ([#17223]).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **`op-geth` Stability:** A critical new issue ([#679]) was reported regarding `op-geth` crashing with "Failed to decode RLP receipts" during a full sync on op-mainnet. An ongoing discussion on abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` ([#613]) also continued, with users reporting that usage returned to normal after an index upgrade completed.
    -   **Acceptance Test Failures:** A series of new issues were opened for multiple acceptance tests failing on the Eris devnet, including `TestERC20Bridge` ([#17385]), `TestFees` ([#17386]), and `TestOperatorFeeDevstack` ([#17387]), indicating a potential regression or environment-specific problem.
    -   **DA Footprint Limit:** New issues were created to ratify the design for the DA footprint block limit ([#17394]) and to add corresponding unit tests in `op-geth` ([#17395]), signaling the next phase of this feature's development.
    -   **Deployment on Alt L1s:** A new issue ([#17365]) was opened concerning the `op-deployer` failing to deploy `OPChain` on alternative L1s, highlighting a potential limitation for non-standard chain setups.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week saw healthy interaction between the core team and the broader community, particularly around operational issues. The active discussions on `op-geth` CPU usage ([#613]) and the new RLP decoding crash ([#679]) involved multiple community members (`cpuchainorg`, `jsvisa`, `hekich`, `sebastianst`) providing reports, diagnostic information, and potential fixes, demonstrating a valuable feedback loop for maintaining node stability. The closure of a large number of Kurtosis-related issues reflects a clear, internally-driven strategic realignment of development priorities. While most development was driven by core contributors, small interactions on issues like builder address funding ([#762]) and the project status page ([#945]) show continued engagement from the wider ecosystem.
