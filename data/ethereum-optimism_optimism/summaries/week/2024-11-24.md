# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Nov 24 - 30, 2024)

## üöÄ Highlights
This was a quiet week for code contributions, with development activity focused on identifying and defining future work. The primary event was the creation of a new issue aimed at optimizing the performance of the `op-challenger`. This issue highlights an ongoing focus on system efficiency, specifically by addressing the high frequency of calls made to the L1 node during game processing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
There were no completed technical developments, code changes, or merged pull requests during this period.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was the sole activity this week, with no issues being closed.

- **New & Active Issues:** A key performance concern was raised in a new issue.
  - **`op-challenger` Performance:** Issue [#13090](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13090) was opened to address the `op-challenger`'s excessive L1 node calls. The component currently processes all games from the last 28 days frequently, leading to a high load. The issue proposes adding a configuration option to limit the processing frequency of games to improve efficiency.
