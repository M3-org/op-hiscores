# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Jun 1 - 7, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the stability and usability of the OP Stack's deployment and CI infrastructure. Key efforts included fixing a critical bug in the `op-deployer` and optimizing the CI pipeline to speed up dependency installation. Significant attention was also directed towards the `op-supervisor`, with several new issues opened to improve its resilience during resets and reorgs. This groundwork on tooling and supervisor behavior paves the way for more robust Superchain operations and future fault-proof enhancements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving deployment tooling, CI efficiency, and documentation.

- **Deployment Tooling & CI Optimization:**
  - A bug in the `op-deployer` was fixed to ensure the L1 contracts release flag is handled correctly during deployments ([#16316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16316)).
  - The CI pipeline was improved by caching `solc` compiler versions, which prevents repeated downloads and streamlines the installation of contract dependencies ([#16317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16317), [#16318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16318)).
  - New documentation was added to guide users through custom Superchain deployments using the `op-deployer` ([#16309](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16309)).

- **Code Refinements & Dependencies:**
  - Several new pull requests were opened for general code hygiene, including the removal of duplicated code in the `IsCrossUnsafe` function ([#16311](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16311)) and the removal of the `GasTokenDeployConfig` from `op-chain-ops` ([#16313](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16313)).
  - A dependency was updated, bumping `golang.org/x/crypto` to version 0.39.0 ([#16328](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16328)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  - An issue related to deployment set validation was closed, confirming that checks for `EthLockboxProxy` consistency are now implemented ([#16058](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16058)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **`op-supervisor` Enhancements:** A significant cluster of new issues was opened to improve the `op-supervisor`'s behavior. These focus on its handling of reset targets, L1 origin validity, and behavior during reorgs ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16314), [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16315), [#16321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16321)).
  - **Fault Proofs & Interop:** Active discussion on issue [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16166) centers on enabling the `op-supervisor` to provide data for fault proofs involving non-genesis interop upgrades. The consensus is leaning towards implementing the fix within the `op-supervisor` rather than the `op-challenger` due to better data availability.
  - **Incorrect Nonce Bug:** A long-standing issue regarding an incorrect nonce returned by `eth_getTransactionCount` for pending transactions on Base ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/623)) remains active, with users continuing to report stuck transactions and requesting updates.
  - **Migration Scripts:** A new issue was created to track improvements for the OPCM migration script on `rehearsal-net-0` ([#16326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16326)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The week's activity indicates a strong, coordinated focus on improving the `op-supervisor` component. The creation of multiple related issues suggests a planned effort to enhance its robustness. The ongoing technical discussion in [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16166) about the best approach for handling fault proof data highlights collaborative problem-solving among core contributors. Additionally, progress was noted on adapting interop sync tests ([#16187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16187)), demonstrating continued momentum on test suite maintenance.
