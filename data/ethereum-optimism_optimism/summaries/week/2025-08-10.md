# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Aug 10 - 16, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused heavily on internal refinement, tooling enhancements, and laying the groundwork for significant future features. While no major features were merged, substantial progress was made through new pull requests aimed at refactoring the `op-node` event system for simplicity and performance. Key new initiatives were kicked off to define Data Availability (DA) footprint limits and advance the Dispute Game with "Multi-proofs." The team also addressed developer experience by improving test stability, standardizing development environments, and triaging user-reported issues with the `op-proposer`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no major pull requests were merged this week, a significant amount of new work was initiated across the stack, focusing on refactoring, performance, and tooling.

-   **`op-node` and Event System Refactoring:** A clear trend emerged towards simplifying the `op-node`'s internal logic. Multiple pull requests were opened to remove event system components, such as `driver.StepEvent` ([#17024](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17024), [#17097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17097)) and other events ([#17100](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17100)). This effort is complemented by improvements to logging ([#17022](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17022)) and context handling ([#17026](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17026)), signaling a strategic move to streamline the service.

-   **Development and Testing Infrastructure:** Efforts were made to improve the developer workflow and test reliability. This included adding lockfiles for `mise` ([#17017](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17017)) and Cargo ([#17020](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17020]) to standardize environments. A fix was proposed to resolve flakiness in acceptance tests during initialization ([#17103](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17103)), and work began on adding local `op-geth` images for Kurtosis ([#17030](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17030)).

-   **Performance and Bug Fixes:** Several pull requests targeted specific improvements. A fix was opened for an HTTP response body leak during Etherscan verification polling ([#16992](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16992)). Performance was also a focus, with a refactor to optimize nested `fmt.Sprintf` calls ([#17102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17102)).

-   **New Feature Prototypes:** Work on new functionality was initiated, including a PR to introduce disabled and unlimited controller types to the `op-batcher` ([#17067](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17067)) and another to add a network upgrade transaction feature ([#17062](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17062)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the closure of a long-standing analysis task and the creation of numerous issues that outline the project's near-term roadmap, particularly around DA limits, tooling, and the dispute game.

-   **Closed Issues:** The primary closure was issue [#311](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/311), marking the completion of the failure modes analysis for `min-base-fee`. The analysis is now documented, concluding a significant research task.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **DA Footprint Limit Initiative:** A major new workstream was established with a series of issues to track the implementation of Data Availability footprint limits. This includes a general tracking issue ([#16998](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16998)), productionizing hackathon work ([#16999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16999)), and writing the design document ([#17009](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17009)) and specification ([#17087](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17087)).
    -   **Dispute Game and Security:** Planning for the next phase of the Dispute Game began with an issue for "Multi-proofs" ([#17013](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17013)), which aims to combine multiple proof systems. A related issue ([#17069](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17069)) was created to track the audit process for the Dispute Game Creator Pattern refactor.
    -   **Tooling and Test Enhancements:** Several issues were opened to improve developer tools. The `op-up` tool is set for an initial release and enhancements ([#17003](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17003), [#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17005), [#17076](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17076)). The `op-sync-tester` is slated for performance improvements through caching and batching ([#17046](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17046), [#17047](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17047)).
    -   **`op-proposer` Instability:** User-facing issues with the `op-proposer` continue to be a focus. A previously closed issue ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13502)) received new reports, and a new issue ([#17042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17042)) was opened for similar `GameAlreadyExists` errors.
    -   **Event System Deprecation:** A key strategic discussion occurred in [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16874), where the team indicated a preference for removing the `op-service` event system entirely. This provides important context for the multiple PRs opened this week to remove event-related code.
