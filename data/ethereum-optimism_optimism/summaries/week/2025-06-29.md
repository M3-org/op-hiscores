# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Jun 29 - 5, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This was a quiet week focused on initiating new work and addressing specific issues, with no major features merged. Development activity centered on tooling improvements, with new pull requests opened to enhance the `op-challenger` with state history checks and to improve the development environment by saving dev-net state. A bug report concerning the `op-deployer` was promptly identified as resolved in a newer release, and a community inquiry was raised regarding precompile initialization. Overall activity was light, particularly around the middle of the week.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No pull requests were completed or merged this week. However, several new workstreams were initiated:

*   **Challenger and DevNet Tooling:**
    *   A new subcommand, `check-state-history`, was proposed for the `op-challenger` to provide better state inspection capabilities ([#16619](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16619)).
    *   Work began on improving the developer experience by saving the dev-net state, which includes the deployment of `ParamToken` and other Bedrock tweaks ([#16626](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16626)).

*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   A routine dependency update for `github.com/docker/docker` was opened by Dependabot ([#16624](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16624)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was focused on specific bug reports and clarifying questions.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   A bug report regarding an error in `op-deployer v0.4.0-rc.2` ([#16618](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16618)) was quickly closed after it was confirmed that the issue had already been resolved in a more recent release candidate.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   A new issue was opened seeking clarification on the purpose of initializing precompile addresses (0x00-0xff) with a 1 wei balance in the OP Stack ([#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16620)).
    *   There were no reports of active issues with significant ongoing discussion this week.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community interaction was characterized by targeted issue reporting and inquiries. The prompt closure of the `op-deployer` issue demonstrates responsive maintenance. The question regarding precompile initialization highlights community engagement with the core technical details of the protocol. No significant collaborative discussions on pull requests or issues were noted in this period.
