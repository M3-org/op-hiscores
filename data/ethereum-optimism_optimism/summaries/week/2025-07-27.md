# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development activity centered on enhancing the configurability and robustness of the OP Stack. A significant push was made to introduce configurable protocol parameters, with new work initiated to allow for a minimum base fee and adjustable data gas costs. This effort is supported by active specification writing and implementation tracking across multiple repositories. Concurrently, proposals were made to improve system monitoring with new alerts for flashblocks, scale the Cannon VM runner for more extensive fault proof testing, and address mempool drift issues observed in the ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While much of the week was dedicated to proposing new features, several maintenance tasks were completed, and significant new work was initiated across the stack.

**Dependency & Maintenance Updates**
Routine maintenance saw the completion of several dependency bumps for Go modules, ensuring the project stays current with its tooling. Key updates included `urfave/cli/v2` to 2.27.7 ([#16924](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16924)), `prometheus/client_golang` to 1.23.0 ([#16928](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16928)), and `doublestar/v4` to 4.9.1 ([#16921](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16921)).

**Proposed Protocol & Governance Enhancements**
A major focus was on increasing the flexibility of the protocol's economic parameters.
- **Configurable Fees:** New pull requests aim to introduce a configurable minimum base fee ([#16852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16852)) and a configurable calldata gas cost ([#16854](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16854)), giving chain operators more control over their fee markets.
- **Superchain & Governance:** Work was proposed to improve `superchainConfig` upgrades ([#16838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16838)) and implement a proposal validator for the governance system ([#16861](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16861)).

**Node & Service Improvements**
Several pull requests were opened to advance the capabilities of core services:
- **Execution Multiplexing:** An initial implementation for execution multiplexing in `op-node` and `op-devstack` was introduced ([#16873](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16873)).
- **Go Implementations:** Updates were made for the CWIA creator pattern ([#16869](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16869)) and `op-node` was updated to use the more modern `math/rand/v2` package ([#16937](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16937)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Discussions this week focused on future protocol features, system stability, and developer experience.

- **Closed Issues:** A long-standing documentation issue ([#1401](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/1401)) regarding clarity on L1 contract deployment was finally closed, marking an improvement for developers setting up new testnets.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Minimum Base Fee:** This feature is a major point of discussion. A new issue ([#16839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16839)) formally proposes the configuration change, while active tracking issue [#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16807) saw updates with links to a draft `reth` implementation. The related specification issue ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/742)) highlighted the need to analyze the state growth impact of the feature.
    - **System Health & Scalability:** New issues were created to enhance monitoring and performance. These include proposals for alerts on flashblocks sequencer health ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16867), [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16868)), a plan to scale the Cannon VM runner to improve fault proof coverage ([#16910](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16910)), and a task to deploy a mempool rebroadcaster to prevent drift ([#16932](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16932)).
    - **Congestion Research:** An older issue on congestion-based transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/306)) saw renewed interest, indicating ongoing research into advanced fee market mechanisms.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted the interconnected nature of the Superchain ecosystem. The issue to address mempool drift ([#16932](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16932)) was opened in direct response to observations from the Base team, demonstrating effective cross-chain collaboration. Furthermore, the extensive discussion around the minimum base fee feature ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16807)) showed tight coordination between the Optimism, `reth`, and `op-alloy` development efforts. Finally, a community member expressed interest in collaborating on the complex topic of congestion-based transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum
