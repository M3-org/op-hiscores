# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the robustness and maintainability of core OP Stack components. Key efforts were directed at improving the dispute monitoring system, with a significant new issue and active discussion around how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes. Work also progressed on node synchronization with a proposal to add ELSync gap filling to `op-node`. Additionally, contract management capabilities were updated, and general code cleanup and dependency maintenance were performed, reflecting a period of targeted, incremental improvements across the stack.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on refining existing components for better reliability and functionality.

- **Node Synchronization & Dispute Monitoring:**
  - To improve data synchronization, a pull request ([#17751](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17751)) was opened to add ELSync gap filling functionality to the `op-node`'s `OnUnsafeL2Payload` method.
  - In the dispute monitoring service, a PR ([#17825](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17825)) was introduced to better handle "not found" scenarios within `op-dispute-mon`, contributing to its overall stability.

- **Contract Management (OPCM):**
  - The Optimism Contract Management (`opcm`) tool received an update to support V2 contracts within the `addGameType` function ([#17782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17782)).
  - A code cleanup effort ([#17828](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17828)) removed an unused `superchainProxyAdmin` immutable variable from OPCM, streamlining the codebase.

- **Dependency Management:**
  - A routine dependency update was submitted by Dependabot to bump the `github.com/docker/docker` dependency from version 27.5.1+incompatible to 28.5.1+incompatible ([#17793](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17793)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week, but a critical new issue was opened, sparking important technical discussion.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - No issues were closed during this period.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - The most significant new issue, [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814), addresses a challenge in `op-dispute-mon` where an out-of-sync rollup RPC is incorrectly detected as a disagreement rather than a synchronization lag.
  - Active discussion on the issue suggests a solution involving the use of `syncStatus` to verify if a node has processed the relevant L1 block. The consensus is leaning towards ignoring results from nodes that are confirmed to be behind, though care must be taken not to trust a node on an incorrect fork simply because it has a higher L2 block number. This highlights a key area of focus for ensuring the dispute system's reliability.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the focused technical discussions around improving system resilience. The active conversation on issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814) between contributors `ajsutton` and `pauldowman` demonstrates a collaborative effort to diagnose and solve a complex problem related to the dispute monitor's behavior with out-of-sync nodes. Development activity was spread across several key components, including `op-node`, `op-dispute-mon`, and `opcm`, indicating coordinated work across different parts of the OP Stack.
