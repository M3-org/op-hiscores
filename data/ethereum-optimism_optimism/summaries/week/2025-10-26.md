# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 29, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push to enhance the stability and reliability of the project's testing infrastructure. A concerted effort was made to de-flake acceptance tests, harden the `op-devstack`, and improve CI pipeline performance. This focus on stability ran in parallel with key feature development, including substantial progress on preparations for the upcoming Jovian hard fork and the integration of V2 dispute game contracts. A notable collaboration with the Celestia team resulted in a fix for an `op-batcher` bug, underscoring the project's commitment to the broader Superchain ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week balanced foundational improvements with forward-looking feature development.

### Testing Infrastructure & Stability
A major theme was improving the robustness of the entire testing and development environment.
- **Acceptance Test Hardening:** Numerous pull requests focused on improving `op-acceptance-tests`, including de-flaking asynchronous EL syncing ([#18029]), hardening the blob base fee calculation test ([#17953]), fixing papercuts like spammer warnings ([#18067]), and increasing the spammer's test budget to prevent failures ([#18080]).
- **`op-devstack` Enhancements:** The developer stack received critical updates to improve stability and usability. A race condition in subprocess handling was fixed ([#17815]), `sysgo` monitoring was enabled for L2 observability ([#18017]), and support was added for enabling individual dev features, preventing accidental feature conflicts ([#17994]).
- **CI & Tooling Improvements:** The CI pipeline was optimized by fixing the `op-e2e-fuzz` job ([#18041]), moving Go tests to regular runners ([#18032]), and ensuring dev features are properly tested within the contracts suite ([#18051]).

### V2 Dispute Game Integration
Progress continued on migrating to the next generation of fault dispute games.
- **`op-deployer` Updates:** The `op-deployer` was enhanced to support V2 fault dispute game contracts ([#18024]) and new CLI flags were added for V2 implementation options ([#18027]).
- **Legacy Code Removal:** As part of the migration, legacy deployment scripts like `DeployDisputeGame.s.sol` ([#18002]) and `DeployAuthSystem.s.sol` ([#18033]) were removed.
- **OPCM & Validator Updates:** Work began to update `OPCM` for V2 ([#18079]) and to support Cannon-Kona games during migration ([#18078]), along with adding validation for these new game types ([#18050]).

### Jovian Hard Fork Preparations
The codebase was updated in preparation for the Jovian network upgrade.
- **Dependency & Configuration Updates:** The `op-geth` dependency was updated to reflect Jovian's timestamp and receipt changes ([#18048]), and accelerated precompile input limits were adjusted in `op-program` ([#18046]).
- **Feature Flag Removal:** Jovian feature toggles were removed from `op-node`, signaling that the features are now standard ([#18047]).

### Core Bug Fixes & Refinements
- **`op-batcher` AltDA Fix:** A bug limiting the max frame size for generic data availability was fixed by exempting it from the max input size check ([#18074]), resolving a key issue for AltDA users ([#17796], [#17872]).
- **Cannon VM Update:** The default Cannon VM version was updated to v8 ([#18062]), and support for the older v7 was officially dropped ([#17177]).
- **`op-deployer` Bug Fixes:** A critical bug in CLI parsing for `add_game_type` was resolved ([#18026]), and a test helper was fixed to prevent false positives ([#18023]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week reflected the focus on stability while planning for future work.

- **Closed Issues:** Key problems resolved include a persistent flaky test in `TestSubProcess` ([#17553]), the successful integration of `sysgo` observability ([#17941]), and the resolution of a Flashblocks websocket timeout ([#17858]). The closure of an issue calling for more `op-deployer` e2e tests ([#16842]) confirmed that recent integration tests have met this need.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Ongoing Stability Efforts:** Despite progress, test stability remains a priority. New issues were opened to track and fix flakiness in `op-devstack` ([#18060], [#18063]) and to de-flakify specific acceptance tests ([#18081], [#18082]).
    - **Breaking Changes Discussion:** An important discussion is ongoing in issue [#17907], where community members noted that new fields in the Jovian `rollupConfig` are breaking third-party tools like `kailua` and `succinct`. This highlights a need for careful versioning and communication around RPC API changes.
    - **Future Work Scoped:** New issues were created to track the full migration of `op-deployer` to V2 scripts ([#18034], [#18035], [#18036]) and to add functionality for L3s to skip L1 chain configuration ([#18070]).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
- The resolution of the `op-batcher` AltDA size issue ([#17872], [#18074]) stands out as a prime example of inter-project collaboration. The reports indicate the fix was developed by Celestia, reviewed by the Optimism team, and then integrated, demonstrating a healthy Superchain ecosystem.
- The active discussion around breaking API changes for Jovian ([#17907]) shows a valuable feedback loop with third-party developers and integrators, providing critical input on the impact of core protocol changes.
- The consistent "flake-shake" and test promotion PRs ([#18022], [#18037], etc.) suggest a coordinated and focused team effort to systematically improve the quality and reliability of the codebase.
