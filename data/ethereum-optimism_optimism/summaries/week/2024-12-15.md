# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Dec 15 - 21, 2024)

## üöÄ Highlights
This was a quiet week for code contributions, with no new pull requests merged or features added. The development focus shifted entirely to issue triage and support. The primary activity centered on a newly reported configuration issue with the `op-proposer`, which failed to create transactions due to an `execution reverted` error. Collaborative discussion on this issue led to identifying a likely misconfiguration of the dispute game type and related contract addresses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, there were no new code contributions, features, or bug fixes merged during this period. All development activity was focused on investigating the issue detailed below.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week's activity was concentrated on understanding and resolving a single critical issue.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - A significant new issue, **[#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13502)**, was opened concerning the `op-proposer`. Users reported it was failing to create transactions, encountering an `execution reverted` error when deployed with a specific command.
  - The active discussion on this issue involved several contributors. The investigation pointed towards a `NoImplementation` error, suggesting a problem with contract configuration. The root cause appears to be an uninitialized `gameImpls` mapping for certain game types.
  - The suggested resolution, confirmed by multiple users, is to upgrade the game factory address proxy implementation and ensure the correct `--game-type` is set (specifically `1` for `PermissionedFaultDisputeGame`).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community interaction was focused on collaborative problem-solving within issue **[#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/13502)**. Contributors `protolambda`, `mw2000`, `asymmetric`, and `dariusL3` worked together to diagnose the `op-proposer` configuration problem, share findings, and confirm the solution. This highlights a responsive community effort to troubleshoot and resolve user-facing deployment issues, even during a period with no new code commits.
