# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a major push toward the Jovian network upgrade, with the merge of a consensus-breaking operator fee formula change and continued progress on the Data Availability (DA) footprint limit. Alongside these feature developments, there was a massive, cross-cutting effort to bolster testing infrastructure, with numerous fixes for flaky tests, expanded test coverage, and CI/CD enhancements. Critical reliability improvements were made to the dispute monitor's ability to handle out-of-sync nodes, and foundational work began on the `op-supernode` framework, signaling a focus on both immediate stability and future scalability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on preparing for the Jovian upgrade, enhancing system reliability, and improving the developer and testing experience.

- **Jovian Upgrade Preparations:**
  - A significant, consensus-breaking change was merged to update the operator fee formula for increased utility ([#17366]).
  - Progress continued on the Jovian DA footprint block limit, with work to add configurability and integrate it with `op-geth` ([#17466]).
  - The `OPCM.deploy` function was updated to use v2 dispute games, deploying `PermissionedDisputeGameV2` when the feature is active ([#17408]).

- **Testing Infrastructure & Reliability:**
  - A substantial effort was dedicated to improving the stability and coverage of `op-acceptance-tests`. This included fixing flaky tests, improving report generation, and promoting stable tests from the `flake-shake` gate ([#17830], [#17833], [#17891], [#17851]).
  - New acceptance tests were added for various scenarios, including EL Sync triggering, reorg/gap filling, and `op-deployer`'s `add-game-type` functionality ([#17894], [#17893], [#17865]).
  - Test coverage and quality were improved for components like `ResourceMetering` and `SafeSend` by converting duplicate tests to fuzz tests and adding edge case handling ([#17812], [#17896]).
  - A critical bug in `op-reth` acceptance tests related to proof generation was fixed ([#17882]).

- **Dispute Monitor Enhancements:**
  - The `op-dispute-mon` was made more robust. One key update differentiates between a transport-level 404 error and a true "output root not found" condition, improving accuracy in multi-node setups ([#17819]).
  - The monitor was also updated to consider a node invalid if it hasn't processed L1 data past the game head, ensuring more reliable sync status checks ([#17831]).

- **Deployment and Node Infrastructure:**
  - A critical bug in `op-deployer` was fixed, which had broken upgrade commands by hardcoding artifact download URLs ([#17848]). The deployer was also updated to support upgrades up to v4.1.0 ([#17824]).
  - Foundational work began on `op-supernode`, introducing a Chain Container Framework for multi-tenant Consensus Layer functionality ([#17659]) and setting its initial version to v0.1.0 ([#17906]).
  - `op-devstack` was improved to dynamically assign Geth P2P ports, preventing conflicts during testing ([#17904]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  - A key bug in `op-dispute-mon`'s handling of out-of-sync nodes was resolved, improving monitor reliability ([#17814]).
  - Several issues related to the Jovian DA footprint limit and Scalar Fix were closed, marking the completion of implementation, unit tests, and acceptance tests for these features ([#17280], [#17002], [#17278], [#17395]).
  - A batch of issues concerning Flashblocks and Fusaka readiness were closed, including component upgrades and coordination with RPC providers ([#17853], [#17854], [#17855], [#17856], [#17857]).
  - The milestone for using the v2 dispute game implementation in `OPCM.deploy` was completed ([#17257]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Jovian Upgrade Concerns:** New issues were opened regarding the operator fee changes, highlighting the need for explicit tests for setting parameters before the upgrade ([#17897]) and a problem where marshaling new `SystemConfig` fields is breaking some ZK stacks ([#17907]). An active discussion continues on whether saturating math is necessary in the `operatorFee` getter ([#17888]).
  - **Infrastructure Stability:** A critical issue was reported where the Sepolia `op-node` is failing to get blobs from the DA provider ([#17871]). Another report indicates `op-conductor` is failing to start the sequencer due to a "no unsafe head" error ([#17899]).
  - **Monitoring & Performance:** A new issue calls for optimizing `op-dispute-mon`'s sync status checks, as `optimism_syncStatus` is being called too frequently ([#17886]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The week saw strong internal collaboration, particularly around the extensive "flake-shaking" and test stabilization efforts, which involved numerous PRs aimed at improving the reliability of the entire CI/CD pipeline. The active discussion and rapid resolution of the `op-dispute-mon` sync issue ([#17814]), which was briefly closed and then reopened pending a PR merge, demonstrates close coordination between developers. Furthermore, the update to the AI Contract Test Maintenance System to include Slack notifications ([#17876]) reflects an ongoing investment in tooling to streamline the contribution process. A comment on an active issue ([#17686]) advising a contributor to coordinate with a maintainer before starting work also provides insight into the project's structured approach to managing community contributions.
