# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the robustness and reliability of the OP Stack's core monitoring and deployment services. Significant progress was made in hardening the `op-dispute-mon` to more accurately handle node synchronization issues and output root discrepancies. The `op-deployer` was updated to support contract upgrades up to v4.1.0, a critical step for maintaining the Superchain. Concurrently, efforts were made to improve the stability of the acceptance testing framework and address health monitoring challenges within `op-conductor`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving system stability, deployment capabilities, and testing infrastructure.

- **Dispute Monitor Enhancements:** The `op-dispute-mon` service received a key update to improve its resilience in multi-node environments. It now correctly differentiates between a network-level 404 error and a genuine "output root not found" condition, leading to more accurate monitoring of output agreements ([#17819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17819)). This work is part of a broader effort to refine how the monitor handles out-of-sync nodes.

- **Deployment Tooling Upgrade:** The `op-deployer` tool was significantly improved to support and test contract upgrades up to version v4.1.0. This ensures the deployment tooling is aligned with the latest contract releases, facilitating smooth network upgrades ([#17824](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17824)).

- **Acceptance Test Stability:** The acceptance test suite saw several improvements aimed at reducing flakiness and improving reporting. Fixes were made to the `flake-shake` tool for more accurate test duration reporting ([#17830](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17830)), and a new test for the L2 EL P2P canonical chain was integrated to expand coverage ([#17833](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17833)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:** Two related issues ([#17678](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17678), [#17680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17680)) were closed, marking the implementation and deployment of partial healthiness tolerance for `rollup-boost` in `op-conductor`. This change makes the conductor more resilient to harmless, transient failures from builder services.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - A new high-priority issue ([#17835](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17835)) was opened to investigate the root cause of `op-conductor` raft timeouts and errors related to forwarding flashblocks from `rollup-boost`.
    - Active discussion continues on issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814) regarding how `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes. The conversation is focused on using the `CurrentL1` sync status to determine a node's validity for a given dispute game, ensuring the monitor relies on the correct source of truth.
    - In issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17686), a maintainer clarified that monitoring multiple replica healthchecks is an infrastructure-level concern for the Platforms Team, not `op-conductor`, guiding future contributions to the correct area.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The week saw active collaboration around improving the fault tolerance of core services. The detailed discussion on issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17814) highlights a collaborative effort to define a robust strategy for handling out-of-sync nodes in the dispute monitor. Furthermore, the clear guidance provided on issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17686) demonstrates effective project management and communication, ensuring contributor efforts are well-aligned with team responsibilities. The influx of new pull requests on October 13th across various components‚Äîfrom service reliability to contract testing‚Äîindicates a high level of ongoing development activity.
