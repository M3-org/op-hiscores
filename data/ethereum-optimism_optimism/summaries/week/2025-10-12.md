# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by significant progress on the upcoming Jovian upgrade, with the merge of a consensus-breaking operator fee formula update ([#17366]) and continued work on the DA footprint limit. Alongside these major feature developments, the team dedicated substantial effort to fortifying the system's reliability. This included extensive improvements to testing infrastructure, particularly within `op-acceptance-tests`, and critical enhancements to the `op-dispute-mon` to more accurately handle out-of-sync nodes. The initial framework for the `op-supernode` was also established, laying the groundwork for future multi-tenant consensus layer capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on advancing the Jovian upgrade, enhancing monitoring capabilities, and improving overall system stability through rigorous testing and bug fixes.

- **Jovian Upgrade Advancement**
  - A consensus-breaking feature was merged to update the operator fee formula, aiming for increased utility ([#17366]).
  - Progress was made on the Jovian DA footprint block limit, adding configurability and integration with `op-geth` ([#17466]).
  - The `OPCM.deploy` function was updated to deploy the `PermissionedDisputeGameV2` implementation when the v2 feature flag is active, preparing for the new dispute game system ([#17408]).

- **Dispute Monitoring and Node Robustness**
  - The `op-dispute-mon` was improved to distinguish between a 404 error and a true "output root not found" condition, enhancing accuracy in multi-node setups ([#17819]).
  - A new rule was added to consider a node invalid in `op-dispute-mon` if it hasn't processed L1 data past the game head, improving the reliability of sync status checks ([#17831]).

- **Testing and CI/CD Fortification**
  - A major effort was undertaken to improve the stability and coverage of `op-acceptance-tests`. This included fixing flaky tests ([#17891]), promoting stable tests from the `flake-shake` gate ([#17851]), and adding new tests for EL sync scenarios, reorgs, and gap-filling ([#17894], [#17893]).
  - The AI Contract Test Maintenance System was upgraded to v1.1.0, adding Slack notifications and bug fixes ([#17876]).
  - Test coverage and quality were improved for components like `ResourceMetering` ([#17812]) and `SafeSend` ([#17896]) by converting duplicate tests into more comprehensive fuzz tests.

- **Deployment and Tooling Fixes**
  - A critical bug in `op-deployer` was fixed where upgrade commands were broken due to the removal of `tag://` locators, ensuring deployment robustness by hardcoding artifact URLs ([#17848]).
  - The `op-deployer` was also updated to support upgrades up to v4.1.0 ([#17824]).

- **Supernode Framework Initiation**
  - The initial Chain Container Framework for `op-supernode` was introduced, enabling multi-tenant Consensus Layer functionality and setting the component version to v0.1.0 ([#17659], [#17906]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  - A key issue regarding `op-dispute-mon`'s handling of out-of-sync nodes was resolved, ensuring the monitor uses in-sync nodes as the source of truth ([#17814]).
  - Several issues related to the Jovian DA footprint were closed, marking the completion of its `SystemConfig` implementation ([#17280]), acceptance tests ([#17278]), and unit tests ([#17395]).
  - Coordination and readiness tasks for Flashblocks components related to the Fusaka upgrade were completed ([#17853], [#17857]).
  - Issues related to Sepolia sequencer deployment and configuration were also resolved ([#17682], [#17683]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - A significant concern was raised that the new operator fee implementation could introduce breaking changes for zk stacks due to the marshaling of new fields in `SystemConfig` before the Jovian fork is active ([#17907]).
  - Operational issues were reported, including an `op-conductor` failure to start sequencing ([#17899]) and a Sepolia `op-node` failing to retrieve blobs from the DA layer ([#17871]).
  - An active discussion continues on whether saturating math is necessary for the `operatorFee` getter, with analysis suggesting it might be simplified to avoid potential reverts ([#17888]).
  - A need for optimization in `op-dispute-mon` was identified, as it currently calls `optimism_syncStatus` too frequently ([#17886]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The week's activity highlights a strong, collaborative push on two fronts: shipping major new features for the Jovian upgrade and systematically hardening the existing infrastructure. The high volume of pull requests focused on `flake-shake` and `op-acceptance-tests` points to a dedicated, cross-team effort to improve CI/CD reliability and test quality. The resolution of the complex `op-dispute-mon` sync issue ([#17814]) demonstrated effective problem-solving through discussion, leading to a targeted fix. Furthermore, the proactive creation of issues around Flashblocks readiness and potential breaking changes from the Jovian operator fee update ([#17907]) indicates diligent coordination and forward-looking risk assessment within the contributor community.
