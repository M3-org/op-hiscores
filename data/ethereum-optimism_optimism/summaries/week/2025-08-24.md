# ethereum-optimism/optimism Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push to advance the OP Stack's fault proof system and testing infrastructure. Major planning and initial development began for integrating Kona and Cannon as a fallback proof mechanism and for a version 2 upgrade of the Fault Dispute Game. Concurrently, the team modernized deployment tooling by migrating `op-deployer` to use Forge, while substantially refactoring the `op-sync-tester` to improve test reliability and maintainability. These parallel efforts in core protocol security, developer tooling, and testing signal a focused drive towards a more robust and developer-friendly Superchain ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on enhancing the fault proof system, overhauling testing infrastructure, and modernizing deployment tools.

### Fault Proof System Enhancements
Progress was made on improving the performance and capabilities of the fault proof system.
- **Cannon Performance:** Cannon's logging frequency was reduced to improve performance during long-running executions ([#17186](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17186)), and its memory footprint was optimized by reducing heap/code cache size to allow more parallel instances on a single machine ([#17246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17246)).
- **Challenger Improvements:** The `op-challenger` gained an option to limit the frequency of its update cycles, reducing calls to L1 nodes ([#17233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17233)).
- **Bug Fixes:** A critical bug in `op-program` related to a length check during the state consolidation step was fixed ([#17220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17220)).

### Testing Infrastructure Overhaul
Significant effort was invested in making the project's testing frameworks more robust, reliable, and capable.
- **Sync Tester Refactoring:** The `op-sync-tester` was heavily refactored to implement the `L2ELNode` interface ([#17200](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17200)) and its API interfaces were moved to `op-service/eth` to resolve circular dependencies ([#17252](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17252)). It also gained support for Verifier Engine APIs across multiple hardforks ([#17234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17234)).
- **Devnet Enhancements:** Flashblocks support was added to the Kurtosis devnet ([#17172](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17172)), and `op-devstack` was improved to verify contract deployment inclusion, preventing race conditions ([#17232](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17232)). A flakiness issue in `op-devstack`'s `AwaitTimestamp` function was also resolved ([#17270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17270)).
- **Acceptance Tests:** A new feature was added to `op-acceptance-tests` to generate a flaky test report, aiding in debugging and improving test reliability ([#17250](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17250)).

### Deployment Tooling Modernization
The migration of `op-deployer` to use Forge as its backend saw significant progress.
- **Forge Integration:** A CLI wrapper for the Forge binary was introduced ([#17235](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17235), [#17231](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17231)), and work began to convert deployment functions like `DeployImplementations` to use Forge ([#17264](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17264)). The system now also enforces specific Forge versions for consistency ([#17242](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17242)).

### Core Protocol and Dependency Updates
- The `op-geth` dependency was updated to include upstream Geth v1.16.1 changes ([#16785](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16785)).
- The `op-node` driver package was reorganized for better code structure ([#17098](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17098)).
- Cannon deployment was updated to support Go 1.24 ([#17155](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17155)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
Several key initiatives and bugs were resolved this week:
- **Flashblocks Enablement:** The go-to-market tasks and public documentation for the public enablement of Flashblocks were completed ([#17027](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17027), [#17141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17141)).
- **Fault Proofs & Testing:** The tracking issue for the Interop proofs U17 workstream was closed ([#15980](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/15980)), and the `op-sync-tester` gained support for the engine namespace ([#16701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16701)).
- **Tooling & Developer Experience:** Several improvements to the `op-up` developer tool were completed, including logging cleanup and adding CLI flags ([#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17007), [#17076](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17076)).

### New & Active Issues
This week saw the creation of several large workstreams that will define near-term development priorities:
- **Dispute Game V2:** A comprehensive set of issues ([#17254](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17254) through [#17263](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17263)) was opened to track the development and deployment of version 2 of the FaultDisputeGame and PermissionedDisputeGame contracts. This represents a major upgrade to the dispute system.
- **Kona + Cannon Integration:** A new initiative to ship Kona + Cannon as a fallback fault proof option was kicked off with a series of tracking issues for integration into `vm-runner`, `op-challenger`, and other tooling ([#17237](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17237), [#17238](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17238), [#17239](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17239), [#17282](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17282)-[#17288](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17288)).
- **P2P Sync Deprecation:** A significant architectural discussion continued in [#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14108) regarding the deprecation of the request-response P2P sync in `op-node`. A detailed alternative proposal for a simpler, more robust unsafe block sync mechanism using a centralized driver was presented, highlighting a potential shift in node architecture.
- **`op-node` Instability:** A new issue was opened to investigate `op-node` instability that is triggered by L1 RPC delays, a critical area for network resilience ([#17245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17245)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong collaborative momentum on key strategic initiatives.
- The migration of `op-deployer` to Forge saw significant community engagement, with contributor `tooshiNoko` expressing interest in leading the effort across multiple issues ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17213) - [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17218)) and coordinating with `bitwiseguy` to avoid overlapping work.
- The architectural discussion around deprecating P2P sync ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/14108)) showcased deep technical collaboration, with `tessr` providing extensive context and relaying ideas from `emilianobonassi` for a new sync mechanism. This points to a healthy process for debating and evolving core protocol design.
