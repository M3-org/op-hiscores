      "author": "axelKingsley",
      "number": 18180,
      "body": "# What\r\nIntroduces `superroot_atTimestamp` as a modular component of `op-supernode`\r\n\r\n# How\r\n\r\n## Superroot Activity\r\nThe Superroot Activity satisfies the RPC Activity interface, meaning it gets to register new methods. This Activity registers `superroot_atTimestamp`.\r\n\r\nThe Activity is given the mapping of Chain Containers so that it can complete the job of constructing a super-root.\r\n\r\nIn order to build a super-root, the Activity currently collects the following information:\r\n- Current Processed L1 by the Virtual Node (ie, the local derivation only). This is likely not needed\r\n- The Verified (ie post-replacement) blocks at the given timestamp, plus the L1 blocks required to verify them.\r\n- The Optimistic (ie pre-replacement) blocks at the same timestamp, plus the L1 blocks required to verify them.\r\n- The SuperRoot 32byte itself\r\n- \r\nBecause there are no verification activities, Verified and Optimistic are the same values presently.\r\n\r\n## Chain Container Interface Expansion\r\nChain Containers Interface is now expanded to handle all requests from the SuperRoot Activity. These new capabilities are:\r\n- BlockAtTimestamp\r\n- SafeHeadAtL1\r\n- L1AtSafeHead\r\n- CurrentL1\r\n- VerifiedAt\r\n- OptimisticAt\r\n- OutputRootAtL2BlockNumber\r\n\r\nIn basically all cases these calls just pass through to either the Virtual Node's SafeDB *or* the Engine Controller\r\n\r\n## Engine Controller Interface\r\nThe Engine Controller Interface is now being used! This is an abstraction of your EL, and its inner L2Provider is satisfied by our normal L2 clients.\r\nThe Engine Controller just exposes those functionalities needed by the Supernode.\r\n\r\n## Virtual Node and SafeDB\r\nThe SafeDB can now be extracted from the underlying Node because we need to ask questions about local derivation. The Chain Container functions dealing with L1:L2 derivaiton simply call down to the Virtual Node, who grabs the SafeDB and consults it.\r\n\r\nFor working in reverse through the SafeDB, there is a binary search over the range. *FULL DISCLOSURE* this binary search was written by AI and I have not given it much oversight yet. I trust AI to write a bisection correctly. @ajsutton suggests just using a linear walkback, which I will likely do, so I haven't felt the need to review this closely yet.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nTested Locally while using `op-sync-tester` between OP Sepolia and Base Sepolia:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"CurrentL1s\": {\r\n    \"11155420\": {\r\n      \"hash\": \"0xb2582f6bfceaa32361f49a17d55da0117bcc13d635390f659daa1e2a38981df0\",\r\n      \"number\": 9507621\r\n    },\r\n    \"84532\": {\r\n      \"hash\": \"0x715c62f7fcf2e81e601c63993c3723f98e1261323e2d5aed9211ce0aafa023d3\",\r\n      \"number\": 9505564\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"Verified\": {\r\n    \"11155420\": {\r\n      \"L2\": {\r\n        \"hash\": \"0x4bc13bdced216ba8626951d3dced871013b69a213bf9e79cf432a0ef3ad62af1\",\r\n        \"number\": 34904225\r\n      },\r\n      \"L1\": {\r\n        \"hash\": \"0xc47b9823e189179c28d544e28e22e52135aab4d860ce6867367e85506a6243a2\",\r\n        \"number\": 9505078\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"84532\": {\r\n      \"L2\": {\r\n        \"hash\": \"0x559bdcd64f23f918577ab790b4d1dae3c1d1483ad079935639c3a746fb4222ff\",\r\n        \"number\": 32921351\r\n      },\r\n      \"L1\": {\r\n        \"hash\": \"0x9efb59dc238ea3477a839d2c8846f8d7875e019947196c6b413780fd116611ef\",\r\n        \"number\": 9505075\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"Optimistic\": {\r\n    \"11155420\": {\r\n      \"L2\": {\r\n        \"hash\": \"0x4bc13bdced216ba8626951d3dced871013b69a213bf9e79cf432a0ef3ad62af1\",\r\n        \"number\": 34904225\r\n      },\r\n      \"L1\": {\r\n        \"hash\": \"0xc47b9823e189179c28d544e28e22e52135aab4d860ce6867367e85506a6243a2\",\r\n        \"number\": 9505078\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"84532\": {\r\n      \"L2\": {\r\n        \"hash\": \"0x559bdcd64f23f918577ab790b4d1dae3c1d1483ad079935639c3a746fb4222ff\",\r\n        \"number\": 32921351\r\n      },\r\n      \"L1\": {\r\n        \"hash\": \"0x9efb59dc238ea3477a839d2c8846f8d7875e019947196c6b413780fd116611ef\",\r\n        \"number\": 9505075\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"SuperRoot\": \"0x0240f14e6bdd243128d4bb8f38f82c321bb42bc429a53f1dd70e74cbd46764c9\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are also new unit tests for all new components and the activity itself.\r\n\r\n# Feedback\r\n\r\nThe API response is not final, but represents the values which go into the final response.
