      "body": "The AnchorStateRegistry checks that the anchorStateRegistry() from the dispute game matches the AnchorStateRegistry itself via a cast to `IFaultDisputeGame`. This won't work for any game type that doesn't have a `anchorStateRegistry()` method.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/578622ccebb1b83210026f72fa9875097f4362ce/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/AnchorStateRegistry.sol#L199-L201\n\nWe should review if this is really necessary (we're trusting the game's `wasRespectedGameTypeWhenCreated()` method anyway so seems odd to not just require that the game was created via the DisputeGameFactory). If it is we need to add `anchorStateRegistry()` to the `IDisputeGame` interface and implement it in all game types.",

The goal is to make revenue sharing simpler and more modular, with configurable values and automated handling where possible.\r\n\r\nIncludes supporting contracts like `SuperchainRevSharesCalculator`, `L1Withdrawer`, and `FeesDepositor`, which act as periphery components of the system and cover the first expected use case.\r\n\r\nThis is opt-in, but will be enabled by default on fresh chains at genesis. Operators must set a chain fees recipient address on L2 for splits to work.\r\n\r\n`FeeVaults` were updated to be more flexible with setters, while keeping backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\n* All new contracts are fully unit tested.\r\n* Genesis logic has dedicated tests, and there ar integration tests covering the full main flow.\r\n* Invariant tests added using Foundry as fuzzer.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n* [specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/782)\r\n* [design-docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/328)\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\nWhen the `FeesDepositor` contract for OP’s L1 fees is deployed, it should be linked [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17505)\r\n\r\n⚠️  **Disclaimer**: We made minimal changes to the Go files to get the checks passing and did so carefully.
