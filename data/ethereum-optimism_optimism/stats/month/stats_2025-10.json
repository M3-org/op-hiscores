      "number": 18063,
      "repository": "ethereum-optimism/optimism",
      "body": "Acceptance tests often assume that they have complete ownership of a `*dsl.EOA`, when in fact multiple may be using the same account at the same time. There are three ways to solve this:\n\n1. Strengthen the `*dsl.EOA` abstraction to assume concurrent ownership of the onchain account is possible. This primarily impacts funding and nonce management.\n2. Run all tests serially and assume the account cannot be used concurrently outside of acceptance tests.\n3. Stop writing acceptance tests as normal Go unit tests. Make a custom test runner instead. Then we can compile a single program that contains all of the tests, and runs them in parallel or in sequence. EOA ownership could be regulated through a master wallet object that is injected into each test.\n\nI'm currently leaning toward option 3: it's probably not even that hard to do. It should also help substantially decrease test times in CI, since we should be able to parallelize almost all of our acceptance tests. We can do Option 2 as well to solve problems where transactions sent by a previous owner of an EOA affect its current owner.",

To do so, it introduces new predeploys (`NativeAssetLiquidity` and `LiquidityController`) that decouple native asset management from core bridging operations while using a single `isCustomGasToken()` flag that disables ETH transfer flows in all bridging methods. The two new pre-deploys manage the native asset supply.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\nCore contracts:\r\n\r\n- `OptimismPortal` and `L1Block`: Tests for `isCustomGasToken()` flag blocking ETH deposits/withdrawals\r\n- `NativeAssetLiquidity`: Tests deposit/withdraw access control and functionality\r\n- `LiquidityController`: Tests minter authorization, mint/burn operations, and metadata functions\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\n- Spec: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/749\r\n- Design Doc: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/305\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n**Contributors**\r\n- @0xOneTony\r\n- @0xniha\r\n- @agusduha\r\n- @ashitakah\r\n- @hexshire\r\n- @Joxess\r\n- @tynes ",

      "body": "This initial PR for `op-supernode` introduces a core functionality: Chain Containers. Chain containers allow for multi-tenant Consensus Layer. The initial functionality of the `op-supernode` is to serve multiple CLs from a shared binary using shared resources.\r\n\r\n## PR Breakdown - How to Review\r\nThis PR is larger than I wanted it to be, but contains a solid unit of functionality: The ability to run multiple CLs inside a containerized system. The code breaks down into more reviewable sections:\r\n\r\n### op-node\r\n- The only change to `op-node` is additional initialization to accept overloaded resources. This is used to create dependency-injected Virtual Nodes with shared resources. The overloads were made available in a prior PR and now being utilized.\r\n\r\nAdditional refactor to the `cliiface` was added to expand a prior refactor I had done, where the `cli.Context` object is replaced.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Tests and Devstack\r\n- A new preset for 2 L2 networks bound by a Supernode is created\r\n- A new \"TestL2CLAdvance Multiple\" test which confirms two different networks advance from the same supernode.\r\n\r\n### Supervisor\r\nA lot of Supervisor is CLi and Boilerplate, but here's why each component exists:\r\n- `supernode` is the primary Application Lifecycle, and manages Chain Containers\r\n- `chain_containers` hold chain-specific configuration and ensure a Virtual Node is always running\r\n- `virtual_node` wrap an underlying CL\r\n- `shared_clients` creates wrapped version of common resources (L1 clients) which the virtual nodes can't close\r\n- `http router` handles top level RPC and routes the calls down to the virtual nodes using a chainID supplied in the url\r\n- `virtual_flags` and `virtual_cli` namespaces the incoming CLI in order to implement a wrapped CLI Context which *appears* normal to the virtual nodes, allowing for 1:1 identical startup, including environment variables and defaults.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n- Unit Test coverage on Virtual Node and Chain Container Lifecycle Management\r\n- Unit Test coverage on virtualized cli and flags\r\n- Unit test coverage on the http router\r\n- Acceptance Test coverage of advancing multiple chains\r\n\r\n- Manual testing of multi-chain syncing of `op-sepolia` and `base-sepolia` including RPC access:\r\n<img width=\"1764\" height=\"1137\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ed2dfa1-50a5-41a0-99cc-d84b68f46226\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n# Milestone 1\r\nCloses/Satisfies[ Milestone 1](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17558)",
