      "number": 18707,
      "body": "## Summary\n\nThis PR improves the test coverage and naming conventions for `OptimismMintableERC20Factory`:\n\n1. **Renamed 6 tests to use `testFuzz_` prefix** - These tests already used fuzz parameters but didn't follow the naming convention\n2. **Corrected misleading function names** - Tests referencing `createStandardL2TokenWithDecimals` now correctly reference `createOptimismMintableERC20WithDecimals` (the actual function being tested)\n3. **Added tests for `createOptimismMintableERC20`** - This public function was only tested indirectly through `createStandardL2Token`\n4. **Added test for `version`** - Uses `SemverComp.parse()` to validate semver format\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] Verify the new `createOptimismMintableERC20` tests are not redundant with existing `createStandardL2Token` tests (they test the same underlying logic since `createStandardL2Token` calls `createOptimismMintableERC20`)\n- [ ] Confirm the test naming changes align with repository conventions\n\n### Test Plan\n```bash\ncd packages/contracts-bedrock\njust test-dev --match-path test/universal/OptimismMintableERC20Factory.t.sol -v\n```\n\nAll 12 tests pass locally.\n\n### Notes\n- Link to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/bba1126ac8ae42e28acc862497cf6d61\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (@aliersh)",

      "title": "p2p: improve static peer resilience with individual exponential backoff monitors",
      "author": "rdin777",
      "number": 18664,
      "body": "## Summary\r\nThis PR refactors the static peer monitoring logic in `op-node/p2p` to improve network resilience. It replaces the fixed 1-minute global polling interval with individual per-peer monitors using an exponential backoff strategy.\r\n\r\n## Context & Motivation\r\nPreviously, `monitorStaticPeers` used a global `time.Ticker` set to 1 minute. If a critical peer (like a sequencer) disconnected, the node could wait up to 59 seconds before attempting a reconnection. In high-stakes environments, this latency in fetching \"unsafe\" blocks is unacceptable.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- **Individual Monitoring:** Replaced the global batch-polling loop with individual goroutines for each static peer (`monitorSingleStaticPeer`).\r\n- **Exponential Backoff:** Implemented a retry strategy starting at 2 seconds and scaling up to 1 minute. This ensures near-instant reconnection after short restarts while preventing resource exhaustion during prolonged outages.\r\n- **Improved Responsiveness:** Removed the reliance on a global `sync.WaitGroup`, allowing the node to respond to different peer states independently.\r\n- **Resource Efficiency:** Leveraging Go routines and `time.After` for a lightweight, event-driven approach.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n- Faster recovery of \"unsafe\" block propagation after sequencer restarts.\r\n- Reduced downtime for validator nodes relying on static peer connections.\r\n- More robust P2P stack under unstable network conditions.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Verified that the node attempts immediate reconnection (2s) upon peer disconnect.\r\n- Verified that the backoff correctly doubles up to the `maxBackoff` limit.\r\n- Verified clean shutdown via `quitC`.",
