Spawn EL, CLA with isthmus enabled\n2. Spawn Sync tester\n3. Connect the CLB with the Sync tester\n4. And make sure the CLB connected with the Sync Tester advances(syncs)\n\nCLB ↔ Sync-Tester ↔ EL ↔ CLA \n\n- [ ] sysgo(extension to sysext can be done in follow up work)  → real data(op-mainnet etc)\n\n1. hardcode the public endpoint (or OP Labs internal EL endpoint) to the test and give this to the initialization of the sync tester.\n2. we may spawn CL to test\n3. Make CL to sync until isthmus(or hf block - 1)\n4. Check CL correctly advances after new hardfork\n\n---\n\nTest case Ideas(ordered by priority)\n\n- [ ] Check every OP Stack HF transitions, not only Isthmus, but all HFs for real data.\n- [ ] Multiple CLs, Single Sync Tester: Each CLs will initialize their own mock EL endpoints given by the sync tester. This validates that multiple CLs can sync together.\n- [ ] User Tx with Sync Tester: Current tests only sync blocks which only contain deposit tx. Create user tx inside L2 blocks and check the L2CLs are synced also.",
