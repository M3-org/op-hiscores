      "author": "louisliu2048",
      "number": 18468,
      "repository": "ethereum-optimism/optimism",
      "body": "**Description**\nWhen `op-node` is configured with `--syncmode=execution-layer` and is restarted after having already synced with reth, it gets stuck in an initialization loop, continuously reporting `el_syncing=true` and refusing to send `ForkchoiceUpdate` requests to the execution engine.\n\n**Environment**\nop-node version: v1.16.2\nExecution client: reth, v1.9.3\nSync mode: `--syncmode=execution-layer`\n\n**Expected Behavior**\nWhen `op-node` restarts and `reth` already has synced data (e.g., block 8594953), `op-node` should:\nQuery `reth`'s current state via `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV3`\nRecognize that `reth` is already synced (not actually syncing)\nResume normal operation (CL sync mode or continue from current state)\n\n**Actual Behavior**\nAfter restart, `op-node`:\n1. Enters `syncStatusWillStartEL` state because `--syncmode=execution-layer` is configured\n2. Reports `el_syncing=true` indefinitely\n3. Never sends `ForkchoiceUpdate` to `reth`\n4. Logs show:\n```\nt=2025-12-02T03:46:26.595+0000 lvl=debug msg=\"Sync process step\" unsafe=0 safe=0 el_syncing=true\nt=2025-12-02T03:46:26.595+0000 lvl=warn msg=\"Rollup driver is backing off because execution engine is syncing\" unsafe_head=0 unsafe_hash=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n```\n5. Meanwhile, `reth` is fully operational with synced data:\n```\nWARN Beacon client online, but no consensus updates received for a while. This may be because of a reth error, or an error in the beacon client! Please investigate reth and beacon client logs! period=135.344793103s\n```\n\nRoot Cause Analysis\nIn `engine_controller.go`:\n```\nfunc NewEngineController(...) *EngineController {\n    syncStatus := syncStatusCL\n    if syncCfg.SyncMode == sync.ELSync {\n        syncStatus = syncStatusWillStartEL  // <-- Gets stuck here on restart\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n\nfunc (e *EngineController) isEngineInitialELSyncing() bool {\n    return e.syncStatus == syncStatusWillStartEL ||\n           e.syncStatus == syncStatusStartedEL ||\n           e.syncStatus == syncStatusFinishedELButNotFinalized\n}\n```\nThe issue is that `syncStatus` is always initialized to `syncStatusWillStartEL` when `--syncmode=execution-layer` is configured, regardless of whether the execution client already has synced data.\n\n**Reproduction Steps**\n1. Start op-node with --syncmode=execution-layer and reth\n2. Wait until synced to a reasonable height (e.g., block 8594974)\n3. Restart op-node (while reth keeps running or restart both)\n4. Observe that op-node gets stuck with el_syncing=true\n\n**Suggested Fix**\nWhen op-node starts in EL sync mode, it should first query the execution client's current state:\n```\nfunc NewEngineController(...) *EngineController {\n    syncStatus := syncStatusCL\n    if syncCfg.SyncMode == sync.ELSync {\n        // Query execution client's current finalized/safe/unsafe heads\n        // If execution client already has finalized blocks, skip to syncStatusFinishedEL\n        // Otherwise, start EL sync as normal\n        syncStatus = syncStatusWillStartEL\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\nAlternatively, during the first `tryUpdateEngine` call, check if the execution client responds with `VALID` for its current head, indicating it's already synced.\n\n**Impact**\n\n- Severity: High\n- Affected users: Anyone using --syncmode=execution-layer with a persistent execution client\n- Service impact: Complete node stall after restart, requiring manual configuration change to recover\n",
