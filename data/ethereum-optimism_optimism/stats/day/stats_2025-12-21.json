      "author": "radik878",
      "number": 18306,
      "body": "Replace the slot-counting approach for constructor argument extraction with a robust method that strips the artifact init bytecode prefix from the deployment transaction input, ensuring correctness for dynamic and nested types per Solidity ABI. The prior implementation incorrectly approximated dynamic data sizes (e.g., treating strings as three fixed slots) and could both miscompute arguments and panic on invalid slices. The new logic uses the Foundry artifact’s Bytecode.Object as the canonical init code, validates that the transaction input starts with this prefix, and returns the remaining suffix as constructor arguments; an optional ABI decode sanity check is included to detect mismatches between artifacts and on-chain data. This aligns extraction with actual ABI encoding and removes assumptions that fail on dynamic encodings.",

However, the size calculation was subtracting the size of **all** frames in the channel, not just the ones being deleted.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\n- All existing tests pass\r\n- New test case verifies correct behavior when pruning multiple frames\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nInclude a link to any github issues that this may close in the following form:\r\n- Fixes #[Link to Issue]\r\n-->\r\n",
