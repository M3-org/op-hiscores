      "author": "gologo13",

      "repository": "ethereum-optimism/optimism",
      "body": "Hello, I’m trying to run Ethereum + Optimism dev networks with Osaka/Fusaka-ready clients.\nI run into an ABI mismatch with op-deployer v0.5.0-rc.2 and [officially published contract artifacts bundle](https://storage.googleapis.com/oplabs-contract-artifacts/artifacts-v1-fffcbb0ebf7f83311791534a41e65ef90df47797f9ca8f86941452f597f7128c.tar.gz).\n\nAs of now, https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts/docker/oplabs-tools-artifacts/us/images/op-deployer/sha256:152cb9409d2d885f287bd2caa947a1ea2e9e921e124c3782c7fe297fa2614130 has tags: [77f31c359f9b3608bf48a8b0981e79b67bd95cb4](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/commit/77f31c359f9b3608bf48a8b0981e79b67bd95cb4) and `v0.5.0-rc.2`.\n\nop-deployer v0.5.0-rc2 supports op-contracts/v5.0.0-rc.2. So, there should be compatibility, but it does not appear so.\n I’d appreciate guidance and can move this if it belongs in a different repo.\n\n**Bug Description**\n\n`op-deployer:v0.5.0-rc.2` assumes the `DeployImplementations` script exposes a `runWithBytes(bytes)` entry point and encodes deployment inputs as a single byte array. The Go caller (`opcm.DeployImplementationsInput`) was updated accordingly and attempts to invoke runWithBytes. However, the officially published contract artifacts bundle ([artifacts-v1-fffcbb0e…](https://storage.googleapis.com/oplabs-contract-artifacts/artifacts-v1-fffcbb0ebf7f83311791534a41e65ef90df47797f9ca8f86941452f597f7128c.tar.gz)) that ships with the devnet tooling still contains an ABI where `DeployImplementations.run(address _dii, address _dio)` is the only entry point; `runWithBytes` is absent. As a result, `op-deployer` fails to load the script at runtime with the error “ABI has 2 arguments, Go has 1”, making L2 contract deployment impossible when using the latest `op-deployer` image together with the published artifacts.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n\n1. Save `network-config.yaml` attached below\n2. Run the devnet bootstrap so that op-deployer apply is executed using the [latest optimism-package](https://github.com/ethpandaops/optimism-package/commit/7bef190d7c0b9f619438ed08b17bd5e5f51e72ff)\n```\nkurtosis run --enclave op-devnet github.com/ethpandaops/optimism-package@7bef190d7c0b9f619438ed08b17bd5e5f51e72ff  --args-file network-config.yaml\n```\n3. Observe the failure during “Apply L2 contract deployments”; the stdout ends with:\n```\nApplication failed: failed to load OPCM script: failed to load DeployImplementations script: script DeployImplementations does not have a method run that accepts an argument of type opcm.DeployImplementationsInput: ABI arguments don't match Go types: ABI has 2 arguments, Go has 1\n```\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nOptimism dev-net is launched successfully.\n\nThe published artifacts for `op-deployer v0.5.0-rc.2` should include a `DeployImplementations` ABI that exposes `runWithBytes(bytes)`, matching the Go caller introduced in this release. With a matching ABI, `op-deployer apply` should complete successfully.\n\n**Environment Information:**\n\n* Operating System: macOS 14.6 (Darwin 24.6.0)\n* Package Version: op-deployer:v0.5.0-rc.2\n* Optimism package: commit 7bef190d7c0b9f619438ed08b17bd5e5f51e72ff\n* Published artifact bundle: artifacts-v1-fffcbb0ebf7f83311791534a41e65ef90df47797f9ca8f86941452f597f7128c.tar.gz (commit `d44bbea2407f4308f9fda20cf776bcb6dff7ff08` recorded inside the bundle)\n\n**Configurations:**\n\nnetwork-config.yaml:\n\nWhat matters most in this context is `op_contract_deployer_params`.\n\n* image: us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-deployer:v0.5.0-rc.2\n* l1_artifacts_locator / l2_artifacts_locator: https://storage.googleapis.com/oplabs-contract-artifacts/artifacts-v1-fffcbb0ebf7f83311791534a41e65ef90df47797f9ca8f86941452f597f7128c.tar.gz\n* No custom flags beyond the defaults in optimism-package for the devnet.\n\n```\n# https://docs.optimism.io/chain/testing/dev-node#configure-your-network\noptimism_package:\n  observability:\n    # Whether to configure observability (e.g. prometheus)\n    enabled: true\n    # Whether to enable features exclusive to the K8s backend (ie log collection)\n    enable_k8s_features: false\n    # Default prometheus configuration\n    prometheus_params:\n      storage_tsdb_retention_time: \"1d\"\n      storage_tsdb_retention_size: \"512MB\"\n      # Resource management for prometheus container\n      # CPU is milicores\n      # RAM is in MB\n      min_cpu: 10\n      max_cpu: 1000\n      min_mem: 128\n      max_mem: 2048\n      # Prometheus docker image to use\n      # Defaults to the latest image\n      image: \"prom/prometheus:v3.1.0\"\n\n  # AltDA Deploy Configuration, which is passed to op-deployer.\n  #\n  # For simplicity we currently enforce chains to all be altda or all rollups.\n  # Adding a single altda chain to a cluster essentially makes all chains have altda levels of security.\n  #\n  # To setup an altda cluster, make sure to\n  # 1.

To unblock deployments, a new artifact bundle built from `op-contracts v5.0.0-rc.2` (where `runWithBytes` is implemented) needs to be published and referenced by the default URLs.\n\n",
