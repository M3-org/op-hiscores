      "author": "sebastianst",
      "number": 18070,
      "repository": "ethereum-optimism/optimism",
      "body": "We have recently introduced the necessity to provide op-node & op-program with the L1 chain config. For known L1s like Mainnet or Sepolia this can be skipped, as it is read automatically from the configs embedded into op-geth.\n\nL3s now have to provide the chain configs of their L2 parent chains like OP/Base sepolia/mainnet. However, for L3s, we don't even strictly need the chain config of their parent chains, because it's currently only used inside derivation to calculate the blob base fee for the L1 attributes. But L2s have blobs disables, so this always results in the trivial value of 1.\n\nTo solve this, I suggest we add a flag like `--l3` that changes some behavior and requirements on other flags, e.g. not requiring the L1 chain config to be provided. Then inside attributes derivation, we can safely just use 1 for the blob base fee if there's no chain config. We could furthermore auto-set the L3 flag if the `L1ChainID` is a known L2 chain ID.\n\nRelated configurability issue for L3s: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18009",

      "body": "## Context\n\nThe rust protocol team is using sysgo to hold long-running, in memory, instances of op-stack devnets for quick feature iteration and network health monitoring.\n\nWe would like to add observability into our devnets - for instance, collect metrics emitted by CL/EL into grafana dashboards. There are several ways to do that:\n\n- Since the devnets are spawn using random OS ports - we'll need to parse the ports each node has bound to and forward the metrics port to a grafana instance.\n- We could also provide a port mapping as an input of sysgo, a bit like in the `syext` mode. This would allow us to run sysgo's devnet in a docker container (no port conflicts), and deterministically map the ports to a grafana instance.",

To do so, it introduces new predeploys (`NativeAssetLiquidity` and `LiquidityController`) that decouple native asset management from core bridging operations while using a single `isCustomGasToken()` flag that disables ETH transfer flows in all bridging methods. The two new pre-deploys manage the native asset supply.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\nCore contracts:\r\n\r\n- `OptimismPortal` and `L1Block`: Tests for `isCustomGasToken()` flag blocking ETH deposits/withdrawals\r\n- `NativeAssetLiquidity`: Tests deposit/withdraw access control and functionality\r\n- `LiquidityController`: Tests minter authorization, mint/burn operations, and metadata functions\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\n- Spec: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/749\r\n- Design Doc: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/305\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n**Contributors**\r\n- @0xOneTony\r\n- @0xniha\r\n- @agusduha\r\n- @ashitakah\r\n- @hexshire\r\n- @Joxess\r\n- @tynes ",
