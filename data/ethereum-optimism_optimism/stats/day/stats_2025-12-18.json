      "number": 18643,
      "repository": "ethereum-optimism/optimism",
      "body": "We have a test for the super root provider covering the intermediate steps between two super roots. The previous super root is known and the next one is not found. The test asserts that all steps should be the InvalidTransitionHash.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-challenger/game/fault/trace/super/provider_test.go#L228-L240\n\nWe need to confirm this behaviour with op-program's expectations. I suspect that it should only transition to the invalid hash at the point where the first chain doesn't have sufficient data on L1 to derive the next block - so some intermediate steps might be valid.\n\nThis may work out ok for supervisor because it can return a super root for unsafe blocks (although there are potentially failure cases where the sequencer for one chain hasn't produced unsafe blocks even though other chains have safe blocks at that timestamp).\n\nThe same test is being ported to the Supernode version (https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18617) where the times we get not found may be different so will need to consider that unsafe blocks don't exist.",

This is accomplished by requiring proposers to provide the preimage of the super root when creating a `SuperFaultDisputeGame`.\r\n\r\nThe Super DG is then extended with a `rootClaim(uint256 _l2ChainId)` method that returns specific output roots contained in the proposal. This allows withdrawals to be proven using only an output root.\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18521, https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18518\r\n",

      "author": "Inphi",
      "number": 18642,
      "body": "This patch solves a major UX issue where contract developers cannot deploy a devnet using forge lite builds (`just forge-build-dev`). Previously, developers had to run full optimized builds (`just forge-build`) before running op-e2e and acceptance tests, which significantly slows down the development cycle.\r\nWhen contracts are compiled without optimizations (lite profile), they often exceed the 24KB code size limit. The op-deployer was enforcing this limit even for genesis deployments, causing deployment scripts and their deployed contracts to fail with \"max code size exceeded\" errors.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, this patch adds a `WithNoMaxCodeSize()` option to the script Host that disables code size enforcement. This option is automatically applied to `DeploymentTargetGenesis` deployments, allowing unoptimized contracts to be deployed during devnet setup.\r\n\r\nNote that this change only affects local development and genesis deployments. Production deployments should still enforce the 24KB limit.",
