      "author": "sebastianst",
      "number": 18102,
      "repository": "ethereum-optimism/optimism",
      "body": "The suggested priority fee, which is usually retrieved by an `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` RPC to an L1 EL client, takes all past transactions into account (e.g. median over last N blocks). But blob transactions have effectively a separate priority fee market from regular transactions and most Ethereum block builders don't include blob transactions that pay low priority fees. For this reason, the batcher/txmgr can be configured with a minimum priority fee, which is usually set to values between 2-10 gwei on Mainnet OP Stack batchers.\n\nHowever, this static configuration has the issue of not being very adaptive. If the fee market is low, batchers potentially over-pay, and if it's high, e.g. during blob or general Ethereum usage spikes, the batcher may have trouble getting its transactions in, or at least would always start from a less effective minimum fee and only reaching the required threshold after a few bumps, for every transaction again.\n\nI suggest we address this in two steps.\n- [ ] Add a separate blob prio fee market tracking module to the `op-service/txmgr` package that populates metrics with a blob prio fee distribution. This gives us visibility into the actual priority fees that get batcher transactions included.\n    - as a plus, we can easily track distributions of other blob tx metrics like number of blobs per blob tx.\n- [ ] Develop a priority fee estimator based on the gathered data (e.g. exp. decay median/other percentile over N blocks) that the txmgr can use for blob transactions.",

      "title": "\"ExtractFromFile expects 'out/' but should expect 'forge-artifacts/' - breaks self-hosted .tzst artifacts\"",
      "author": "Bidon15",
      "number": 18663,
      "repository": "ethereum-optimism/optimism",
      "body": "**Bug Description**\n\n`ExtractFromFile()` in `op-deployer/pkg/deployer/artifacts/embedded.go` expects `out/` directory inside the tarball, but:\n1. The `mktar` tool packages artifacts with `forge-artifacts/` prefix\n2. The `downloadHTTP()` function returns `path.Join(tmpDir, \"forge-artifacts\")` expecting that directory name\n3. The `file://` scheme also expects `forge-artifacts/`\n4. The error message incorrectly states \"forge-artifacts directory not found\" when it's actually looking for `out/`\n\nThis inconsistency causes HTTP-downloaded `.tzst` artifacts to fail extraction with a misleading error.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n\n1. Build contract artifacts using the standard `just copy-contract-artifacts` command in `op-deployer/justfile`\n2. Upload the resulting `artifacts.tzst` to an HTTP server\n3. Configure op-deployer to use `https://your-server.com/artifacts.tzst` as L1ContractsLocator\n4. Run any deployment pipeline\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nThe artifact extraction should succeed, or at minimum the error message should accurately describe what directory it's looking for.\n\n**Environment Information:**\n- Operating System: macOS 14 (darwin 25.2.0)\n- Package Version: op-deployer commit `425adb12a1` (post v0.5.2)\n\n**Configurations:**\n\nUsing custom HTTP locator for L1 artifacts:\n```yaml\nl1ContractsLocator: https://example.com/artifacts-op-deployer-v0.5.2.tzst\n```\n\n**Logs:**\n\n```\nop-deployer pipeline failed: download L1 artifacts: failed to download artifacts: failed to extract embedded artifacts: forge-artifacts directory not found within embedded artifacts: stat /tmp/op-deployer-artifacts-4006286600/bundle-527794892/out: no such file or directory\n```\n\nNote the contradiction: error says \"forge-artifacts directory not found\" but the path it's checking ends in `/out`.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nThe bug is in `op-deployer/pkg/deployer/artifacts/embedded.go` line 92:\n\n```go\nforgeArtifactsDir := filepath.Join(untarPath, \"out\")  // Expects \"out/\"\nif _, err := os.Stat(forgeArtifactsDir); err != nil {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"forge-artifacts directory not found...\")  // But error says \"forge-artifacts\"\n}\n```\n\nMeanwhile in `download.go` line 100:\n```go\nreturn os.DirFS(path.Join(tmpDir, \"forge-artifacts\")), nil  // Expects \"forge-artifacts/\"\n```\n\nAnd `mktar` (used by `just copy-contract-artifacts`) packages with `forge-artifacts/` prefix.\n\n**Suggested Fix:**\n\nChange line 92 in `embedded.go` from:\n```go\nforgeArtifactsDir := filepath.Join(untarPath, \"out\")\n```\nto:\n```go\nforgeArtifactsDir := filepath.Join(untarPath, \"forge-artifacts\")\n```\n\nThis aligns with `downloadHTTP()`'s return statement, the `file://` scheme handling, and the `mktar` tool's output.\n\nRef: TODO comment on line 99 #18346  suggests this area is under active consideration for restructuring.\n",
