Once we have this hint, the host part can later support different ways of prefetching the data, but we need the hint shipped in an on-chain prestate upgrade before that. ",

      "body": "The kona-interop program uses EIP-2935 to look up block hashes efficiently.

As a result, `kona-interop` may be falling back to walking backward through the chain to locate the target block hash, which is likely too expensive to execute inside the fault proof.\n\nWe need to review the logic and maybe add an action test that asserts that the EIP-2935 path is fully utilized for fast block hash lookup.",

      "author": "axelKingsley",
      "number": 18292,
      "body": "# Issue\r\nIf a System Config is ever uploaded that has malformed data, the node will stall indefinitely, because the L1 Traversal expects to be able to navigate forward through the L1 without errors. And of course, once the L1 Tx is committed, there is no remediation.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\nDon't emit an error if parsing fails. But it's not so simple: the incumbent algorithm applied receipt updates *individually*, meaning that malformed updates were also being partially applied.\r\nSo then the solution was 3-fold:\r\n\r\n- Refactored all the individual parse switch/case statements to their own functions for cleanliness, and defined a common \"SystemConfigParseError\"\r\n- Supplied a *copy* of the original SystemConfig to the update function\r\n- As the copy is being updated, if the returned error from updates are ever the Parse Error, `nil` is returned and the update has no effect, and the function returns without further processing.\r\n- Once all updates are applied to the copy, the actual SystemConfig is replaced all at once\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\nNew Unit Test showing that when parsing is successful the config is updated, but any parse error yields no update.\r\n\r\n# Feedback\r\nI'm not positive that cancelling out of all additional updates is the right call. I suspect it is because the updates are being handled as a group, but there's also a chance the spec says that receipts are processed individually. Either way, parse errors shouldn't be critical errors here.\r\n",
