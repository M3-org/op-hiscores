      "author": "maradini77",
      "number": 18358,
      "body": "\r\n\r\nThe `sendTx` method in `SimpleTxManager` was creating new `time.Ticker` instances on each loop iteration without properly stopping previous ones. This caused a resource leak where:\r\n- Background goroutines from tickers accumulated over time\r\n- Timer resources were never released\r\n- Under high transaction volume, this could lead to memory exhaustion and degraded performance\r\n\r\n",
