      "author": "axelKingsley",
      "number": 17659,
      "body": "This initial PR for `op-supernode` introduces a core functionality: Chain Containers. Chain containers allow for multi-tenant Consensus Layer. The initial functionality of the `op-supernode` is to serve multiple CLs from a shared binary using shared resources.\r\n\r\n## PR Breakdown - How to Review\r\nThis PR is larger than I wanted it to be, but contains a solid unit of functionality: The ability to run multiple CLs inside a containerized system. The code breaks down into more reviewable sections:\r\n\r\n### op-node\r\n- The only change to `op-node` is additional initialization to accept overloaded resources. This is used to create dependency-injected Virtual Nodes with shared resources. The overloads were made available in a prior PR and now being utilized.\r\n\r\nAdditional refactor to the `cliiface` was added to expand a prior refactor I had done, where the `cli.Context` object is replaced.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Tests and Devstack\r\n- A new preset for 2 L2 networks bound by a Supernode is created\r\n- A new \"TestL2CLAdvance Multiple\" test which confirms two different networks advance from the same supernode.\r\n\r\n### Supervisor\r\nA lot of Supervisor is CLi and Boilerplate, but here's why each component exists:\r\n- `supernode` is the primary Application Lifecycle, and manages Chain Containers\r\n- `chain_containers` hold chain-specific configuration and ensure a Virtual Node is always running\r\n- `virtual_node` wrap an underlying CL\r\n- `shared_clients` creates wrapped version of common resources (L1 clients) which the virtual nodes can't close\r\n- `http router` handles top level RPC and routes the calls down to the virtual nodes using a chainID supplied in the url\r\n- `virtual_flags` and `virtual_cli` namespaces the incoming CLI in order to implement a wrapped CLI Context which *appears* normal to the virtual nodes, allowing for 1:1 identical startup, including environment variables and defaults.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n- Unit Test coverage on Virtual Node and Chain Container Lifecycle Management\r\n- Unit Test coverage on virtualized cli and flags\r\n- Unit test coverage on the http router\r\n- Acceptance Test coverage of advancing multiple chains\r\n\r\n- Manual testing of multi-chain syncing of `op-sepolia` and `base-sepolia` including RPC access:\r\n<img width=\"1764\" height=\"1137\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ed2dfa1-50a5-41a0-99cc-d84b68f46226\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n# Milestone 1\r\nCloses/Satisfies[ Milestone 1](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17558)",
