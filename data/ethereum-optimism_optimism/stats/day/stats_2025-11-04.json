L2s usually have a block time of 2s, so a sixth of Ethereum's target block time of 12s.\n\nWe could make those constants optionally configurable, or even better make the L1 block time optionally configurable and then adjust these constants accordingly, similar to how the finality loopback is already calculated differently for AltDA chains at\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/cb54822c5e18925498f48d8677b71992bf402631/op-node/rollup/finality/finalizer.go?plain=1#L37-L50\n\nWe could then also auto-detect at startup if a `L1ChainID` is known in the embedded superchain-registry and then load the block time automatically. This way, L3s using e.g. Base or OPM would just work out of the box without additional configuration.\n\nIn a next step we may even consider adding an optional `L1BlockTime` to the rollup config.",

      "number": 18150,
      "repository": "ethereum-optimism/optimism",
      "body": "During a recent batcher incident on OPM and a few other chains, the batcher max. throttled the sequencer because the data backlog grew over the max threshold. However, the growing data backlog wasn't caused by blob congestion but other factors (General Ethereum congestion & base fee hikes) and the blob base fee stayed mostly at 1 wei.\n\nWe should consider easing the throttling controller to not throttle as much when there are indications that blob space isn't congested, e.g. when the blob base fee is below a threshold. This avoid overzealous throttling behavior that may unnecessarily impact the chain.",

While the build can take 5-10 minutes we can leverage CircleCI caching to avoid building it when we haven't changed anything about the build process. Additionally it's designed so that the hash is provided to configure games but the prestate itself doesn't have to be available unless tests actually use it (which non currently do). So we're testing the contract deployment for cannon-kona and providing valid inputs, but not challenger's ability to actually execute that prestate.\r\n\r\n Currently only interop tests are setting the cannon-kona prestate, but we build both variants.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease describe any tests you've added.

See https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\nThis PR adds two new optional configuration fields to the rollup config to make finality behavior configurable:\r\n\r\n- finality_lookback: Controls the number of L1 blocks to look back for finality verification. When not set, uses the existing default calculation (129 blocks, or based on alt-DA challenge/resolve windows if alt-DA is enabled).\r\n- finality_delay: Controls the number of L1 blocks to traverse before attempting to finalize L2 blocks again. When not set, defaults to 64 blocks.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\nNo tests added in this PR. The changes follow the existing config pattern used by other optional fields (e.g., PectraBlobScheduleTime, AltDAConfig). The config validation is covered by the existing test infrastructure in types_test.go which validates JSON serialization/deserialization and round-tripping of config fields.\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\n#18009\r\n\r\n",
