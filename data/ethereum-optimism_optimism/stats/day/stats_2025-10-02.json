Then, the upstream code will handle applying the right blob parameters. \n\n\n2. API related code. \n\nAre we able to fetch data from L1 after Fusaka?\n\n---\nNote that in future work we may be able to avoid hardcoding the per-fork blob parameters and read them from an  L1 RPC. However this is out of scope for this project.\n\nWe should also take account of[ EIP 7918](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7918) which bounds the blob base fee by execution cost.

The blob base fee is not part of the block, but rather computed from `block.excessBlobGas` with an [off-chain formula which varies according to which fork is active on L1.](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/blob/51614a3dc4af4a2b503ba178e0799013e6774613/consensus/misc/eip4844/eip4844.go#L180-L197)\r\n\r\nFor the L2 state to accurately reflect the blob base fee of the l1 origin, it is necessary to provide the L2 consensus client information about the fork schedule of the L1 which it derives from.\r\n\r\nThis PR does that in a relatively lightweight way:\r\n* for chains with a recognized l1 chain ID (such as all chains in the superchain registry), lookup the l1 chain config (either for Mainnet or Sepolia) using op-geth as a library. This information needs to be kept updated as new L1 forks (including BPO or blob parameter only forks) are scheduled in upstream geth and brought in through upstream merges. When this happens, we need to update the absolute prestate for the proofs system\r\n* for custom chains (think devnets, test environments, chains which are not in the superchain registry) it is required to pass the l1 chain config via a new CLI flag. This can be directly JSON encoded or embedded in a `genesis.json` file.\r\n* Does something similar for the op-program, which does not allow information to be passed at runtime but instead via filesystem embedding\r\n* Also includes changes in this direction for kona\r\n\r\nI avoided embedding the l1 chain config inside the `rollup.Config`, as that would require changing all of the data in the superchain registry.\r\n\r\nThis is a backwards compatible change which also makes the derivation pipeline compatible with post-Fusaka L1s.\r\n\r\nThe diff is quite large, mostly because there is a lot of boilerplate to change both in production and test code.\r\n\r\nCloses #17493 ",
