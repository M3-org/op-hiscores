      "author": "devin-ai-integration",
      "number": 18232,
      "body": "# test(contracts): improve RLPReader test coverage and organization\n\n## Summary\nThis PR enhances the RLPReader test suite by adding comprehensive test coverage for previously untested functions and reorganizing test contracts to match the source code structure. The changes include:\n\n- **New test coverage**: Added `RLPReader_ToRLPItem_Test` contract with 4 tests covering empty bytes revert and valid conversions for single bytes, multi-byte arrays, and RLP-encoded lists\n- **New test coverage**: Added `RLPReader_ReadRawBytes_Test` contract with 5 tests covering single bytes, short strings, empty lists, nested lists, and reading from parsed lists\n- **Test organization**: Reorganized test contracts to match source function declaration order (toRLPItem → readList → readBytes → readRawBytes)\n- **Naming consistency**: Renamed test contracts to PascalCase (`ReadList_Test`, `ReadBytes_Test`, `ReadRawBytes_Test`)\n\nAll 45 tests pass (up from 37 tests previously). No changes to the RLPReader library itself, only test enhancements.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] Verify test contract organization matches source function declaration order in `src/libraries/rlp/RLPReader.sol`\n- [ ] Review new `toRLPItem` tests to ensure they cover the important edge case (empty bytes revert) and valid conversion scenarios\n- [ ] Review new `readRawBytes` tests to ensure they cover different RLP item types (single byte, string, list, nested list)\n- [ ] Confirm CI passes, especially semgrep checks for proper `vm.expectRevert()` usage\n\n### Test Plan\nRun the test suite locally to verify all tests pass:\n```bash\ncd packages/contracts-bedrock\njust test-dev --match-path test/libraries/rlp/RLPReader.t.sol -vv\n```\n\nExpected: All 45 tests should pass with no failures.\n\n### Notes\n- No fuzz tests were added because the RLPReader library tests specific RLP encoding rules with exact byte sequences that have special meaning in the RLP specification\n- The `toRLPItem_emptyBytes_reverts` test uses `forge-config: default.allow_internal_expect_revert = true` to properly test reverts in pure functions, following the pattern used elsewhere in this test file\n- Link to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/1d862a26a0ef462fba82589af78f5ed1\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (@aliersh)",

      "body": "## Description\r\nReplaces string-based error matching with Go's `errors.Is()` for proper error type checking in the transaction resubmitter.\r\n\r\nAddresses TODO(13408) on line 107-108 of `op-service/txinclude/resubmitter.go`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- **Performance**: `errors.Is()` is faster than string comparison\r\n- **Correctness**: Properly handles wrapped errors (Go 1.13+ convention)\r\n- **Maintainability**: Survives error message changes\r\n- **Best Practice**: Aligns with Go error handling conventions\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Replaced `strings.Contains(err.Error(), recognizedErr.Error())` with `errors.Is(err, recognizedErr)`\r\n- Removed `strings` import as it's no longer needed\r\n- Added comprehensive tests for wrapped errors, deeply nested errors, and unknown errors\r\n- Updated function documentation to explain the improvement\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\nFixes TODO(13408)\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nThis is my first contribution to Optimism. I understand this may be considered a small change, but I wanted to learn the contribution process and address a legitimate technical improvement.
