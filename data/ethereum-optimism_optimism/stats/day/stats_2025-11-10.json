      "number": 18144,
      "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nAdds a just file to build a particular Kona-client version. While the build can take 5-10 minutes we can leverage CircleCI caching to avoid building it when we haven't changed anything about the build process. Additionally it's designed so that the hash is provided to configure games but the prestate itself doesn't have to be available unless tests actually use it (which non currently do). So we're testing the contract deployment for cannon-kona and providing valid inputs, but not challenger's ability to actually execute that prestate.\r\n\r\n Currently only interop tests are setting the cannon-kona prestate, but we build both variants.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease describe any tests you've added.

      "body": "## Description\r\nReplaces string-based error matching with Go's `errors.Is()` for proper error type checking in the transaction resubmitter.\r\n\r\nAddresses TODO(13408) on line 107-108 of `op-service/txinclude/resubmitter.go`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- **Performance**: `errors.Is()` is faster than string comparison\r\n- **Correctness**: Properly handles wrapped errors (Go 1.13+ convention)\r\n- **Maintainability**: Survives error message changes\r\n- **Best Practice**: Aligns with Go error handling conventions\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Replaced `strings.Contains(err.Error(), recognizedErr.Error())` with `errors.Is(err, recognizedErr)`\r\n- Removed `strings` import as it's no longer needed\r\n- Added comprehensive tests for wrapped errors, deeply nested errors, and unknown errors\r\n- Updated function documentation to explain the improvement\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\nFixes TODO(13408)\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nThis is my first contribution to Optimism. I understand this may be considered a small change, but I wanted to learn the contribution process and address a legitimate technical improvement. Happy to expand this PR or take on additional tasks based on maintainer feedback.",
