      "body": "**Description**\n\nThis is WIP so far but meant to show how it can work. The big todo is to\nrename the feature flag with the name of the hardfork that the CGT\nupgrade is included in. This does leak knowledge of CGT into the client\nsoftware so that it can optionally deploy the CGT predeploys.\nIt is expected that the CGT predeploys will be in the genesis if\nthe hardfork is active at genesis only on CGT chains.\n\nRelevant links:\n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/305\n- https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/313\n- https://github.com/defi-wonderland/optimism/pull/478\n\n<!--\nContributions welcome!
