      "title": "op-node: Sequencer blocks rejected by P2P when chain is behind wall clock time",
      "author": "louisliu2048",
      "number": 18470,
      "repository": "ethereum-optimism/optimism",
      "body": "**Description**\nWhen the Sequencer is behind wall clock time (e.g., after a restart with existing chain state, or under heavy load), newly produced blocks are rejected by the P2P gossip layer with \"timestamp too old\" error. This causes a deadlock where:\n\n1. Sequencer produces valid blocks\n2. P2P rejects them (age > 60s threshold)\n3. RPC nodes receive nothing\n4. Chain appears stuck\n\n**Enviroment**\nop-node: v1.16.2\n\n**Root Cause**\nThere's a design gap between two mechanisms:\n\nMechanism | Purpose | Comparison\n-- | -- | --\nMaxSequencerDrift | Detect L2 vs L1 drift | L2.Timestamp > L1.Time + MaxSequencerDrift\nGossipTimestampThreshold | P2P validation | WallClock - L2.Timestamp > 60s\n\n**The problem**: `MaxSequencerDrift` only checks L2 vs L1 time, but P2P validation uses **wall clock time**. When both L2 and L1 are synchronized but behind wall clock, `NoTxPool` is not triggered, so the Sequencer continues producing full blocks instead of empty blocks to catch up.\n\n**Reproduction Steps**\n\n1. Start a sequencer with existing chain data where the last block timestamp is >60 seconds behind current time\n2. Or run under heavy load where block production falls behind\n3. Observe P2P rejections: `Payload rejected - timestamp too old`\n4. RPC nodes stop receiving blocks\n\n**Example Logs**\n```\n# Sequencer produces block with old timestamp\nmsg=\"Sequencer sealed block\" txs=1 time=1764662076\n\n# P2P rejects it (69 seconds old > 60 second threshold)\nmsg=\"Payload rejected - timestamp too old\" payload_timestamp=1764662076 current_time=1764662145 age_seconds=69 threshold_seconds=60\n```\n\n**Suggested Fix**\nAdd wall clock lag detection in `startBuildingBlock()` that leverages the existing `recoverMode`:\n```\n// Check if L2 block timestamp is behind wall clock time.\n// This fixes a design gap where MaxSequencerDrift only checks L2 vs L1 drift,\n// but P2P validation uses wall clock time (GossipTimestampThreshold = 60s).\n//\n// Logic:\n// - Enter recover mode when lag > 45s (before P2P rejection at 60s)\n// - Exit recover mode when lag <= 5s (fully caught up, in sync with wall clock)\n// - This prevents oscillation between empty and full blocks\nconst (\n    wallClockLagTrigger = 45 // Enter recover mode when lag exceeds this\n    wallClockLagTarget  = 5  // Exit recover mode when lag is below this\n)\nwallTime := uint64(time.Now().Unix())\nblockTime := uint64(attrs.Timestamp)\n\n// Only check if block timestamp is behind wall clock (avoid uint64 underflow)\nif wallTime <= blockTime {\n    // Block is ahead of or at wall clock - no lag, exit recover mode if active\n    if recoverMode {\n        d.recoverMode.Store(false)\n        recoverMode = false\n        log.Info(\"Sequencer caught up to wall clock, exiting recover mode\",\n            \"block_timestamp\", blockTime, \"wall_time\", wallTime)\n    }\n} else {\n    lagSeconds := wallTime - blockTime\n\n    if lagSeconds > wallClockLagTrigger && !recoverMode {\n        // Enter recover mode - we're too far behind, need to catch up\n        d.recoverMode.Store(true)\n        recoverMode = true\n        log.Warn(\"Sequencer is behind wall clock, entering recover mode to catch up\",\n            \"block_timestamp\", blockTime, \"wall_time\", wallTime,\n            \"lag_seconds\", lagSeconds, \"trigger_threshold\", wallClockLagTrigger)\n    } else if lagSeconds <= wallClockLagTarget && recoverMode {\n        // Exit recover mode - we've caught up to wall clock\n        d.recoverMode.Store(false)\n        recoverMode = false\n        log.Info(\"Sequencer caught up to wall clock, exiting recover mode\",\n            \"block_timestamp\", blockTime, \"wall_time\", wallTime,\n            \"lag_seconds\", lagSeconds, \"target_threshold\", wallClockLagTarget)\n    }\n}\n```\n**Key Design Points**:\n1. Two thresholds to prevent oscillation:\n - Trigger threshold (45s): Enter recover mode before P2P rejection (60s)\n - Target threshold (5s): Exit only when fully caught up\n2. Reuses existing `recoverMode`: No new state variables needed\n3. Handles uint64 underflow: Checks `wallTime <= blockTime` before subtraction\n\n**Impact**\n - **Severity**: High - can cause complete chain stall\n - **Affected**: Any sequencer that restarts with stale data or falls behind under load",

      "title": "op-node stuck in EL sync mode after restart when reth already has synced data",
      "author": "louisliu2048",
      "number": 18468,
      "repository": "ethereum-optimism/optimism",
      "body": "**Description**\nWhen `op-node` is configured with `--syncmode=execution-layer` and is restarted after having already synced with reth, it gets stuck in an initialization loop, continuously reporting `el_syncing=true` and refusing to send `ForkchoiceUpdate` requests to the execution engine.\n\n**Environment**\nop-node version: v1.16.2\nExecution client: reth, v1.9.3\nSync mode: `--syncmode=execution-layer`\n\n**Expected Behavior**\nWhen `op-node` restarts and `reth` already has synced data (e.g., block 8594953), `op-node` should:\nQuery `reth`'s current state via `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV3`\nRecognize that `reth` is already synced (not actually syncing)\nResume normal operation (CL sync mode or continue from current state)\n\n**Actual Behavior**\nAfter restart, `op-node`:\n1. Enters `syncStatusWillStartEL` state because `--syncmode=execution-layer` is configured\n2. Reports `el_syncing=true` indefinitely\n3. Never sends `ForkchoiceUpdate` to `reth`\n4. Logs show:\n```\nt=2025-12-02T03:46:26.595+0000 lvl=debug msg=\"Sync process step\" unsafe=0 safe=0 el_syncing=true\nt=2025-12-02T03:46:26.595+0000 lvl=warn msg=\"Rollup driver is backing off because execution engine is syncing\" unsafe_head=0 unsafe_hash=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n```\n5. Meanwhile, `reth` is fully operational with synced data:\n```\nWARN Beacon client online, but no consensus updates received for a while. This may be because of a reth error, or an error in the beacon client! Please investigate reth and beacon client logs! period=135.344793103s\n```\n\nRoot Cause Analysis\nIn `engine_controller.go`:\n```\nfunc NewEngineController(...) *EngineController {\n    syncStatus := syncStatusCL\n    if syncCfg.SyncMode == sync.ELSync {\n        syncStatus = syncStatusWillStartEL  // <-- Gets stuck here on restart\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n\nfunc (e *EngineController) isEngineInitialELSyncing() bool {\n    return e.syncStatus == syncStatusWillStartEL ||\n           e.syncStatus == syncStatusStartedEL ||\n           e.syncStatus == syncStatusFinishedELButNotFinalized\n}\n```\nThe issue is that `syncStatus` is always initialized to `syncStatusWillStartEL` when `--syncmode=execution-layer` is configured, regardless of whether the execution client already has synced data.\n\n**Reproduction Steps**\n1. Start op-node with --syncmode=execution-layer and reth\n2. Wait until synced to a reasonable height (e.g., block 8594974)\n3. Restart op-node (while reth keeps running or restart both)\n4. Observe that op-node gets stuck with el_syncing=true\n\n**Suggested Fix**\nWhen op-node starts in EL sync mode, it should first query the execution client's current state:\n```\nfunc NewEngineController(...) *EngineController {\n    syncStatus := syncStatusCL\n    if syncCfg.SyncMode == sync.ELSync {\n        // Query execution client's current finalized/safe/unsafe heads\n        // If execution client already has finalized blocks, skip to syncStatusFinishedEL\n        // Otherwise, start EL sync as normal\n        syncStatus = syncStatusWillStartEL\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\nAlternatively, during the first `tryUpdateEngine` call, check if the execution client responds with `VALID` for its current head, indicating it's already synced.\n\n**Impact**\n\n- Severity: High\n- Affected users: Anyone using --syncmode=execution-layer with a persistent execution client\n- Service impact: Complete node stall after restart, requiring manual configuration change to recover\n",
