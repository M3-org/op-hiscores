See https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\n- Introduces a new `builder_foundry` build stage (built on `$TARGETPLATFORM` as opposed to `$BUILDPLATFORM`) that downloads `forge`, checks the checksum and outputs the version. Forge version could not have been checked when running this on `$BUILDPLATFORM`\r\n- Bumps the `builder` stage image to `alpine:3.21` so that we can install the exact same `just` as we have in `mise.toml`. This in turn means we don't need to use `mise` to install it which in turn means more stable builds\r\n- Replaces string-concatenation JSON building in `forge-checksums.sh` with a `jq`-based script\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\n- Although `foundryup` is a much simpler way of installing `forge`, it would mean updating the mechanism with which we compute checksums. `curl`-based download has been preserved not to touch the `op-deployer` codebase",

      "author": "googgoog",
      "number": 18020,
      "body": "## Description\r\n#10063  cancels the entire rangeRequest when any peer returns ResultCodeNotFoundErr. This forces all peers to stop working on that range and wait for the next alt-sync tick, increasing time-to-sync. In static peer setups where some peers may not yet have the requested blocks (e.g., backup sequencers or RPC nodes), a single NotFound from one peer cancels the range and unnecessarily stalls others.\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\nMake NotFound handling peer-local instead of global:\r\n\r\n1. **Remove global `activeRangeRequests` tracking**: The original implementation used a global `activeRangeRequests` map to track active ranges and would delete the entire range when any peer returned NotFound, causing all peers to stop processing that range.\r\n\r\n2. **Add peer-local `failedRanges` tracking**: Each `peerLoop` now maintains its own goroutine-local `failedRanges` map keyed by `rangeReqId`. When a peer returns NotFound for a range, we mark only that peer as failed for that range and skip subsequent blocks in that range to that specific peer.\r\n\r\n3. **Preserve parallel syncing**: Other peers continue syncing the same range immediately without waiting for the next alt-sync tick, maximizing throughput in multi-peer setups.\r\n\r\nThis approach eliminates unnecessary global coordination, reduces memory overhead (no shared mutex-protected map), and allows healthy peers to continue syncing even when some peers don't have the requested blocks yet.",
