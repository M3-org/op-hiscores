Today, we rely on metrics reported from the website to know whether people are making it through -- but this is imperfect, because not everyone will click on all of the commands, and it doesn't reflect whether people run into problems on their own machines. We should add actual instrumentation to op-up to determine whether it's working for users and if people are falling off anywhere.",
