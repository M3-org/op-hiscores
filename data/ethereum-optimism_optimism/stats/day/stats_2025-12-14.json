See https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\nThis enables a hash-locked Mise flow, where running `make shell` builds a container, verifies the contents with separate lockfiles, and mounts the current working directory into a shell with `mise` and `pip` installed programs in `$PATH`.\r\n\r\nNote: I did have to install some programs separately using `pip`, as there was no way to install them using `mise` where I could control the exact versions installed. Every other program should be hash-locked without issue.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease describe any tests you've added. If you've added no tests, or left important behavior untested, please explain why not.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem you're solving.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nInclude a link to any github issues that this may close in the following form:\r\n- Fixes #[Link to Issue]\r\n-->\r\n",
