      "title": "p2p: improve static peer resilience with individual exponential backoff monitors",
      "author": "rdin777",
      "number": 18664,
      "body": "## Summary\r\nThis PR refactors the static peer monitoring logic in `op-node/p2p` to improve network resilience. It replaces the fixed 1-minute global polling interval with individual per-peer monitors using an exponential backoff strategy.\r\n\r\n## Context & Motivation\r\nPreviously, `monitorStaticPeers` used a global `time.Ticker` set to 1 minute. If a critical peer (like a sequencer) disconnected, the node could wait up to 59 seconds before attempting a reconnection. In high-stakes environments, this latency in fetching \"unsafe\" blocks is unacceptable.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- **Individual Monitoring:** Replaced the global batch-polling loop with individual goroutines for each static peer (`monitorSingleStaticPeer`).\r\n- **Exponential Backoff:** Implemented a retry strategy starting at 2 seconds and scaling up to 1 minute. This ensures near-instant reconnection after short restarts while preventing resource exhaustion during prolonged outages.\r\n- **Improved Responsiveness:** Removed the reliance on a global `sync.WaitGroup`, allowing the node to respond to different peer states independently.\r\n- **Resource Efficiency:** Leveraging Go routines and `time.After` for a lightweight, event-driven approach.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n- Faster recovery of \"unsafe\" block propagation after sequencer restarts.\r\n- Reduced downtime for validator nodes relying on static peer connections.\r\n- More robust P2P stack under unstable network conditions.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Verified that the node attempts immediate reconnection (2s) upon peer disconnect.\r\n- Verified that the backoff correctly doubles up to the `maxBackoff` limit.\r\n- Verified clean shutdown via `quitC`.",

      "author": "maradini77",
      "number": 18665,
      "body": "\r\n\r\nThe original code used `io.ReadAll(r.Body)` without any size restrictions, allowing malicious clients to send arbitrarily large requests and potentially exhaust server memory. This is a security concern even for localhost services, as it could be exploited through proxied connections or misconfigured network access.\r\n\r\nThe 1 MiB limit is sufficient for legitimate JSON-RPC requests while providing protection against abuse. The implementation follows Go best practices using `http.MaxBytesReader`, which is the standard approach for this type of protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
