The custom implementation is optimized for the sp1 zkVM.\nHowever, there are still a couple areas where the program runs keccak and sha2 outside the evm. We need to ensure that these don't use native riscv implementations, but utilize the sp1 host via its syscall interface.",

      "author": "theochap",
      "number": 17689,
      "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to run sysgo with more than an op-reth node at a time. This is a fix that ensures we can:\r\n- deploy networks with more than one op-reth node\r\n- networks can be successfully deployed.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n- Disabling discv4 discovery in op-reth is not enough. The former configuration would deploy op-reth with discv5 using the default address/port, which then would fail when trying to deploy more than one node and this node tries to bind to an already allocated port\r\n- `admin_addPeer` does not _also_ connect peers automatically - manually added peers through the admin api will not appear in `admin_peers`. The check below was failing because we expected that peers added through `admin_addPeer` would also appear when calling `admin_peers`.",
