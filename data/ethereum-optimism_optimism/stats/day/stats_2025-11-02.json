This counts each error from an rpc as a new event even if the rpc is the same (so one rpc giving 10 errors sets this to 10).\r\n* Gauge of the total number of games where some nodes reported not found and others had the block in the last update cycle.\r\n* Gauge of the total number of games where some nodes reported the output root as safe and others as unsafe in the last update cycle\r\n* Gauge of the total number of games where nodes returned different expected output roots in the last update cycle\r\n\r\nReviewers might want to look at each commit separately, there's one for each metric.\r\n\r\nCloses #11020 ",
