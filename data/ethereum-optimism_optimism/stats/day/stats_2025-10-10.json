Test implementation steps:\r\n* target standard opcm address based on `op-contracts` tag\r\n* fork sepolia at `blockNum = (opcmDeploymentBlock) + 1`\r\n* using op-sepolia contract/role addresses, attempt `op-deployer upgrade`",

See https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is based on #17819 \r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\n`OutputAgreementEnricher` treated any \"not found\" from a rollup node as a valid response, which can cause false disagreements when some nodes are simply behind.\r\n\r\nThis change prevents false disagreements when some nodes are temporarily behind, while still rejecting proposals actually in the future.\r\n\r\n- Classify proposals using max UnsafeL2 across nodes; treat proposals beyond this as future and disagree without error.\r\n- Ignore notFound from nodes that are behind (UnsafeL2 < requested L2, with lagTolerance).\r\n- Require SyncStatus on OutputRollupClient; remove optional capability check.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: this adds an extra RPC call per enrichment, doubling the load on the nodes.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\nAdd & adjust cases for behind-node ignoring and future proposals.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem you're solving.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\nFixes #17814\r\n",
