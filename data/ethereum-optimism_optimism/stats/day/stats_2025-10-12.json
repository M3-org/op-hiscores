      "author": "ajsutton",
      "number": 17831,
      "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nUpdate op-dispute-mon so that it checks the rollup node sync status and considers it invalid if `CurrentL1` is not above the game's L1 head block number. This ensures that the node's safe head correctly reflects the L1 data used in the game and ensures that out of sync nodes are ignored. If all nodes are out of sync it is considered a fetch failure.\r\n\r\nConveniently this also means that when a node falls behind, rather than raising an alert because games resolved incorrectly, it will report that op-dispute-mon is failing to update games correctly which is much less scary and misleading.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nAlternative to https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17825\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\nPart of #17814 - will also need to update the super_agreement_enricher with equivalent logic before calling this completed done.",
