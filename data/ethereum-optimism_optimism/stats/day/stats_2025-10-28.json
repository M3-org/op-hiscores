      "number": 18063,
      "repository": "ethereum-optimism/optimism",
      "body": "Acceptance tests often assume that they have complete ownership of a `*dsl.EOA`, when in fact multiple may be using the same account at the same time. There are three ways to solve this:\n\n1. Strengthen the `*dsl.EOA` abstraction to assume concurrent ownership of the onchain account is possible. This primarily impacts funding and nonce management.\n2. Run all tests serially and assume the account cannot be used concurrently outside of acceptance tests.\n3. Stop writing acceptance tests as normal Go unit tests. Make a custom test runner instead. Then we can compile a single program that contains all of the tests, and runs them in parallel or in sequence. EOA ownership could be regulated through a master wallet object that is injected into each test.\n\nI'm currently leaning toward option 3: it's probably not even that hard to do. It should also help substantially decrease test times in CI, since we should be able to parallelize almost all of our acceptance tests. We can do Option 2 as well to solve problems where transactions sent by a previous owner of an EOA affect its current owner.",

      "repository": "ethereum-optimism/optimism",
      "body": "Retries and timeouts are closely related. All retries and timeouts should be audited, and we should remove the ones that cause flakes.\n\nExamples of things we should fix:\n\n* Retrying with an arbitrary timeout. **Timeouts are side effects**: we should push them upwards in the call stack as we do with opening files, or at least make them configurable. When an operation is supposed to occur before a specific timestamp that we can compute based on protocol parameters, we should compute that timestamp and use it.\n* Retrying with an arbitrary an arbitrary sleep. Same notes/caveats as in the timeout case.\n* Retrying due to errors that should be handled at a lower level of abstraction (e.g., 429s should be backed-off and retried by an HTTP client, not an Ethereum JSON RPC client). Scope-creep is a risk if done as part of the op-devstack PR: we can leave it to a follow-up if necessary.\n* Blindly retrying when an operation should succeed immediately.",
