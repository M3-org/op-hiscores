This must be validated using a real chain, possibly using sync tester.\n   - [x] Verify that if an unsafe chain gap emerges, due to network issues, a node running in CLSync or ELSync mode will fill the gap and continue to advance its unsafe chain, without help from the L1 derivation pipeline. https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17751: `TestUnsafeChainStalling_{CLSync|ELSync}` @nonsense \n   - [x] Same as upper case, but with actual stopping/starting of the op-node and not just network issue.

This scenario occurs when the verifier eventually reached the unsafe head tip @pcw109550 \n    - https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17895\n- [x] Reorg cases, where safe head reorg happened. FCU result will be INVALID. Test Reset behavior. This may be mocked using the Sync tester, since harder to test. When the safe head reorgs, the FCU call will (eventually) return INVALID, because that unsafe payload will not build on top of the safe head. Use sync-tester or test-sequencer.

We may directly query the EL using the `eth_getBlockByNumber(\"latest\")` to check that the EL actually reached the unsafe head tip, not relying on the `optimism_syncStatus` result from the op-node.\n\nMore concretely the testing scenario will be\n1. Prepare op-node and EL(with stable ELP2P) which are fully synced, reaching the unsafe tip\n2. Shut op-node down. \n3. Stay for 5 minutes to make the EL(with stable ELP2P) not advance, intentionally making the unsafe gap\n4. Start op-node with\n    - RR Sync disabled (via flag)\n    - Patched to do the EL Sync to fill in the gap\n    - Connected via CLP2P and receiving unsafe payloads from the sequencer\n5. Measure time until the EL(with stable ELP2P) reaches the tip.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "To remove ReqRes P2P sync (RRSync) and replace the functionality it provides with the ELSync, we must make sure that the L2CL pushes forward to the L2EL the unsafe payloads that it receives, rather than just add them to its payloads heap within the `EngineController`.\n\nSo when we start with `sync.CLSync`, or `sync.ELSync` with initial EL Sync done,\n```go\nfunc (s *SyncDeriver) OnUnsafeL2Payload(ctx context.Context, envelope *eth.ExecutionPayloadEnvelope) {\n\t// If we are doing CL sync or done with engine syncing, fallback to the unsafe payload queue & CL P2P sync.\n\tif s.SyncCfg.SyncMode == sync.CLSync || !s.Engine.IsEngineSyncing() {\n\t\ts.Log.Info(\"Optimistically queueing unsafe L2 execution payload\", \"id\", envelope.ExecutionPayload.ID())\n\t\ts.Engine.AddUnsafePayload(ctx, envelope)\n\t} else if s.SyncCfg.SyncMode == sync.ELSync {\n...\n```\n\nThe op-node will queue the unsafe payload at the unsafe payload queue, at `s.Engine.AddUnsafePayload(ctx, envelope)`, and trigger `EngineController.onForkChoiceUpdate`.\n\n`onForkChoiceUpdate` will peek the unsafe payload queue, and only apply when\n```go\n\t// Only process the next payload if it is applicable on top of the current unsafe head.\n\t// This avoids prematurely attempting to insert non-adjacent payloads (e.g. height gaps),\n\t// which could otherwise trigger EL sync behavior.\n\trefParentHash := nextEnvelope.ExecutionPayload.ParentHash\n\trefBlockNumber := uint64(nextEnvelope.ExecutionPayload.BlockNumber)\n\tif refParentHash != event.UnsafeL2Head.Hash || refBlockNumber != event.UnsafeL2Head.Number+1 {\n\t\te.log.Debug(\"Next unsafe payload is not applicable yet\",\n\t\t\t\"nextHash\", nextEnvelope.ExecutionPayload.BlockHash, \"nextNumber\", refBlockNumber, \"unsafe\", event.UnsafeL2Head)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// We don't pop from the queue. If there is a temporary error then we can retry.\n\t// Upon next forkchoice update or invalid-payload event we can remove it from the queue.\n\te.processUnsafePayload(ctx, nextEnvelope)\n```\n\nWe specifically need to allow that we may send the unsafe payload to the EL to trigger EL Sync again. This way, EL will get payloads signaled that won't be built on top of the current unsafe head at the EL. The notified EL will actively ask other EL peers to fill in the gap. Meanwhile, op-node will still consolidating and advancing its unsafe heads due to safe head advances. EL and CL will cooperatively close the gap.\n\n\n\n\n",
