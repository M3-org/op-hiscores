Not sure what's left because there are still warnings in the contracts which causes the build to fail before it gets to actually running the go tests. The ones I've run locally are now passing though.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\nSome unit tests are still commented out - need to work out what they were actually testing and move them to the right place.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nBuilds on https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16340\r\n",
