      "number": 17434,
      "body": "# Remove ProtocolVersions smart contract entirely\n\n## Summary\nThis PR completely removes the `ProtocolVersions` smart contract and all related functionality from the Optimism repository. The ProtocolVersions contract was previously used to manage superchain protocol version information (required and recommended versions), but is being removed entirely.\n\n**Key changes:**\n- **Deleted core contract files**: `ProtocolVersions.sol`, `IProtocolVersions.sol`, and associated tests\n- **Updated OPContractsManager**: Removed `protocolVersions` immutable field and constructor parameter\n- **Modified deployment scripts**: Removed ProtocolVersions deployment logic across multiple scripts\n- **Updated Go runtime config**: Removed protocol version loading and handling from `op-node`\n- **Cleaned up integrations**: Removed protocol version handling from superchain logic and E2E tests\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n**⚠️ HIGH RISK - This is a large-scale removal that touches critical system components**\n\n- [ ] **End-to-end system testing**: Deploy and run a complete devnet to verify the system works without ProtocolVersions\n- [ ] **Codebase reference audit**: Search the entire codebase for any remaining \"ProtocolVersions\" references that might have been missed\n- [ ] **Node operation verification**: Test that op-node starts up correctly and handles runtime configuration without protocol version data\n- [ ] **Deployment script validation**: Run deployment scripts in test environments to ensure they work without ProtocolVersions\n- [ ] **Protocol upgrade mechanism check**: Verify that any existing superchain protocol coordination still functions correctly without the ProtocolVersions contract\n\n### Notes\n- This change removes a core mechanism previously used for superchain protocol coordination\n- The system should continue to function normally, but thorough testing is essential given the scope\n- Some generated files and snapshots may need additional cleanup (mentioned in implementation but not visible in diff)\n\n**Session details**: Requested by gh.owner.kfichter@oplabs.co    \n**Link to Devin run**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/af5872289edb4b0888c4ebf3cab9b90b",
