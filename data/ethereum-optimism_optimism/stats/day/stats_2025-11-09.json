      "author": "forkfury",
      "number": 17476,
      "body": "Fix race condition in ThrottleController.Update by changing RLock to Lock\r\n\r\nThe Update method was using RLock to read strategy reference, then calling\r\nstrategy.Update() without holding the lock. This created a race condition\r\nwhere SetStrategy could change the strategy between reading the reference\r\nand using it, leading to inconsistent throttling behavior.\r\n\r\nUsing Lock instead of RLock ensures the entire Update operation is atomic,\r\npreventing SetStrategy from modifying the strategy while Update executes.\r\nThis guarantees thread safety when controller type is changed at runtime.",
