      "body": "Dealing with the 2,500+ line monorepo CircleCI config is daunting and introduces developer friction.\n\nOne of the key pain points discussed in today’s Protocol retro is that there’s no good way to test changes locally. There is the `circleci` CLI which CircleCI provides that’s intended for this purpose, but engineers have not been able to get it to work when they tried it on their machines.\n\nSome ideas:\n* Get the `circleci` tool to work for our dev environment\n* Move as much logic as possible out of the config itself and into just or make files. The Rust team has followed this approach (see [here](https://github.com/op-rs/kona/blob/main/.github/workflows/rust_ci.yaml))",
