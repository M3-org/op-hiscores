      "title": "feat(conductor): fix leader loop switch by adding round-robin leadership transfer",
      "author": "KyrinCode",
      "number": 18697,
      "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an optional round-robin leader transfer mechanism to op-conductor, configurable via the `--raft.round-robin-leader-transfer` flag.\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\n\r\nThe current leader transfer in op-conductor relies on Raft's default `LeadershipTransfer()`, which selects the next leader based on log completeness (the follower with the most up-to-date log). However, this selection mechanism is unaware of application-level health status (op-node & execution layer).\r\nThis can cause a problematic scenario where unhealthy nodes keep being elected as leader in a loop:\r\n1. Node A becomes leader but is unhealthy → transfers to Node B (most complete log)\r\n2. Node B becomes leader but is also unhealthy → transfers back to Node A (now has most complete log)\r\n3. Healthy Node C never gets elected because its log is slightly behind\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nIntroduce a deterministic round-robin leader transfer that cycles through all voters in sorted order (by ServerID):\r\n- Node A → Node B → Node C → Node A → ...\r\nThis ensures that even if only one node in the cluster is healthy, it will eventually become the leader after at most N-1 transfers.\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n\r\n- Added `--raft.round-robin-leader-transfer` flag (default: false, backward compatible)\r\n- Added transferLeaderRoundRobin() function that:\r\n  - Sorts all voters by ServerID for consistent ordering across nodes\r\n  - Transfers to the next node in sorted order\r\n  - If transfer fails (e.g., target has stale logs), tries the next node\r\n  - Handles \"leadership transfer in progress\" gracefully\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\nManual testing was performed with a 4-node conductor cluster where 2 nodes were intentionally made unhealthy. With round-robin enabled, leadership eventually transferred to a healthy node. Without round-robin, leadership kept bouncing between the unhealthy nodes.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis feature is opt-in and disabled by default to maintain backward compatibility. When disabled, the behavior is identical to the current implementation.\r\nThe round-robin approach trades off Raft's \"most up-to-date log\" optimization for guaranteed leader rotation. In practice, this is acceptable because:\r\nAll voters in a healthy cluster should have similar log states\r\nThe primary goal of leader transfer in op-conductor is to find a healthy sequencer, not to optimize for log completeness\r\nIf a target node's log is too stale, Raft will reject the transfer and we try the next node\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\n- Related to sequencer high-availability and failover reliability\r\n",

      "title": "p2p: improve static peer resilience with individual exponential backoff monitors",
      "author": "rdin777",
      "number": 18664,
      "body": "## Summary\r\nThis PR refactors the static peer monitoring logic in `op-node/p2p` to improve network resilience. It replaces the fixed 1-minute global polling interval with individual per-peer monitors using an exponential backoff strategy.\r\n\r\n## Context & Motivation\r\nPreviously, `monitorStaticPeers` used a global `time.Ticker` set to 1 minute. If a critical peer (like a sequencer) disconnected, the node could wait up to 59 seconds before attempting a reconnection. In high-stakes environments, this latency in fetching \"unsafe\" blocks is unacceptable.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- **Individual Monitoring:** Replaced the global batch-polling loop with individual goroutines for each static peer (`monitorSingleStaticPeer`).\r\n- **Exponential Backoff:** Implemented a retry strategy starting at 2 seconds and scaling up to 1 minute. This ensures near-instant reconnection after short restarts while preventing resource exhaustion during prolonged outages.\r\n- **Improved Responsiveness:** Removed the reliance on a global `sync.WaitGroup`, allowing the node to respond to different peer states independently.\r\n- **Resource Efficiency:** Leveraging Go routines and `time.After` for a lightweight, event-driven approach.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n- Faster recovery of \"unsafe\" block propagation after sequencer restarts.\r\n- Reduced downtime for validator nodes relying on static peer connections.\r\n- More robust P2P stack under unstable network conditions.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Verified that the node attempts immediate reconnection (2s) upon peer disconnect.\r\n- Verified that the backoff correctly doubles up to the `maxBackoff` limit.\r\n- Verified clean shutdown via `quitC`.",
