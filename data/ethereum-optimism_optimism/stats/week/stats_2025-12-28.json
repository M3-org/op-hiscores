      "title": "feat(conductor): fix leader loop switch by adding round-robin leadership transfer",
      "author": "KyrinCode",
      "number": 18697,
      "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an optional round-robin leader transfer mechanism to op-conductor, configurable via the `--raft.round-robin-leader-transfer` flag.\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\n\r\nThe current leader transfer in op-conductor relies on Raft's default `LeadershipTransfer()`, which selects the next leader based on log completeness (the follower with the most up-to-date log). However, this selection mechanism is unaware of application-level health status (op-node & execution layer).\r\nThis can cause a problematic scenario where unhealthy nodes keep being elected as leader in a loop:\r\n1. Node A becomes leader but is unhealthy → transfers to Node B (most complete log)\r\n2. Node B becomes leader but is also unhealthy → transfers back to Node A (now has most complete log)\r\n3. Healthy Node C never gets elected because its log is slightly behind\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nIntroduce a deterministic round-robin leader transfer that cycles through all voters in sorted order (by ServerID):\r\n- Node A → Node B → Node C → Node A → ...\r\nThis ensures that even if only one node in the cluster is healthy, it will eventually become the leader after at most N-1 transfers.\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n\r\n- Added `--raft.round-robin-leader-transfer` flag (default: false, backward compatible)\r\n- Added transferLeaderRoundRobin() function that:\r\n  - Sorts all voters by ServerID for consistent ordering across nodes\r\n  - Transfers to the next node in sorted order\r\n  - If transfer fails (e.g., target has stale logs), tries the next node\r\n  - Handles \"leadership transfer in progress\" gracefully\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\nManual testing was performed with a 4-node conductor cluster where 2 nodes were intentionally made unhealthy. With round-robin enabled, leadership eventually transferred to a healthy node. Without round-robin, leadership kept bouncing between the unhealthy nodes.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis feature is opt-in and disabled by default to maintain backward compatibility. When disabled, the behavior is identical to the current implementation.\r\nThe round-robin approach trades off Raft's \"most up-to-date log\" optimization for guaranteed leader rotation. In practice, this is acceptable because:\r\nAll voters in a healthy cluster should have similar log states\r\nThe primary goal of leader transfer in op-conductor is to find a healthy sequencer, not to optimize for log completeness\r\nIf a target node's log is too stale, Raft will reject the transfer and we try the next node\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\n- Related to sequencer high-availability and failover reliability\r\n",

      "title": "feat(conductor): add raft config to allow no shutdown on remove",
      "author": "KyrinCode",
      "number": 18699,
      "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new flag `--raft.no-shutdown-on-remove` to `op-conductor` that prevents Raft from shutting down when the node is removed from the cluster.\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\n\r\nWhen a node is removed from the cluster via `conductor_removeServer`, HashiCorp Raft's default behavior (`ShutdownOnRemove=true`) causes the Raft instance to completely shut down. This means:\r\n- The node cannot be re-added to the cluster without restarting the entire process\r\n- This creates operational complexity when managing cluster membership dynamically\r\n- In scenarios where nodes need to be temporarily removed and re-added (e.g., during maintenance or role changes), a full restart is required\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nAdd a configurable flag that sets `ShutdownOnRemove=false` in Raft configuration. When enabled:\r\n- The node transitions to follower state instead of shutting down when removed\r\n- The node can be immediately re-added to the cluster via `conductor_addServerAsVoter` or `conductor_addServerAsNonvoter`\r\n- No process restart is required\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n\r\n- Added `--raft.no-shutdown-on-remove` flag (default: `false`, backward compatible)\r\n- Added `NoShutdownOnRemove` field to `RaftConsensusConfig`\r\n- Configured Raft's `ShutdownOnRemove` based on the flag value\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\nManual testing was performed:\r\n1. Started a 3-node conductor cluster with `--raft.no-shutdown-on-remove` enabled\r\n2. Removed a node via `conductor_removeServer`\r\n3. Verified the node transitioned to follower state (instead of Raft shutting down)\r\n4. Re-added the node via `conductor_addServerAsVoter`\r\n5. Verified the node successfully rejoined the cluster without restarting (by checking the `conductor_clusterMembership` of this node)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis feature is opt-in and disabled by default to maintain backward compatibility with existing deployments. The default Raft behavior (shutdown on remove) is preserved unless explicitly configured otherwise.\r\nUse cases for this flag:\r\n- Dynamic cluster membership management without downtime\r\n- Graceful role transitions (voter ↔ nonvoter)\r\n- Easier disaster recovery scenarios\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\n- Related to cluster membership management and operational flexibility\r\n",
