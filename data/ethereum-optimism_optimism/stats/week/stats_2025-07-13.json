Error if it does not, and abort the sync test.\n- `engine_forkchoiceUpdated{V1,V2,V3}`: check if the forkchoice hashes are canonical. Update the `test_head`, `test_safe`, `test_finalized` in-memory forkchoice values. And check if the block-building attributes (if any) match the inputs to the actual block.\n- `engine_getPayload{V1,V2,V3,V4}`: return the block that matches the expected block from the block-building job arguments.\n\nNote that `engine_newPayload` and `engine_forkchoiceUpdated` is enough for checking the L2 CL sync as a verifier.  `engine_getPayload` is needed when the CL is acting as a sequencer.\n\n- [x] Isthmus Engine APIs: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17072\n    - `engine_newPayloadV4, engine_getPayloadV4, engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV3`\n- [x] Ecotone, Fjord, Granite, Holocene Engine APIs: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17181\n    - `engine_newPayloadV3, engine_getPayloadV3, engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV3`\n- [ ] Bedrock, Canyon, Delta Engine APIs: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17234\n    - `engine_newPayloadV1, engine_getPayloadV1, engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1, engine_newPayloadV2, engine_getPayloadV2, engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV2`\n\n",

      "body": "Add sync acceptance tests using the sync tester.\n\n---\n\nsysgo → easier to config because while we are booting the system, we may make a preset to enable/disable space.\n\n@pcw109550 's suggestion is that, to make a minimal feedback loop to test, lets do in sysgo with activation of isthmus.\n\n- [x] sysgo → simple\n\n1. Spawn EL, CLA with isthmus enabled\n2. Spawn Sync tester\n3. Connect the CLB with the Sync tester\n4. And make sure the CLB connected with the Sync Tester advances(syncs)\n\nCLB ↔ Sync-Tester ↔ EL ↔ CLA \n\n- [ ] sysgo(extension to sysext can be done in follow up work)  → real data(op-mainnet etc)\n\n1. hardcode the public endpoint (or OP Labs internal EL endpoint) to the test and give this to the initialization of the sync tester.\n2. we may spawn CL to test\n3. Make CL to sync until isthmus(or hf block - 1)\n4. Check CL correctly advances after new hardfork\n\n---\n\nTest case Ideas(ordered by priority)\n\n- [ ] Check every OP Stack HF transitions, not only Isthmus, but all HFs for real data.\n- [ ] Multiple CLs, Single Sync Tester: Each CLs will initialize their own mock EL endpoints given by the sync tester. This validates that multiple CLs can sync together.\n- [ ] User Tx with Sync Tester: Current tests only sync blocks which only contain deposit tx. Create user tx inside L2 blocks and check the L2CLs are synced also.",
