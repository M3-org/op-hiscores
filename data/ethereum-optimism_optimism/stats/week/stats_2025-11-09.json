([l1_traversal.go](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/84152b267a0787c3f8eba092ce3b687cc8c21463/op-node/rollup/derive/l1_traversal.go#L78-L81) and [system_config.go](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/84152b267a0787c3f8eba092ce3b687cc8c21463/op-node/rollup/derive/system_config.go#L91-L94))\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n<!--\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\n-->\nIf a malformed batcher hash is used on the SystemConfig, it should be a failure to update and maybe also add in a check around version/event where it doesn't know the version, then it's a critical error.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n<!--\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\n-->\nYou can mitigate this with a local build which ignores this error, but is inappropriate for general use.\n\n**Additional context**\n<!--\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\n-->\nWe had one of our partners who was working on a staging network hit this",

This must be validated using a real chain, possibly using sync tester.\n   - [x] Verify that if an unsafe chain gap emerges, due to network issues, a node running in CLSync or ELSync mode will fill the gap and continue to advance its unsafe chain, without help from the L1 derivation pipeline. https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17751: `TestUnsafeChainStalling_{CLSync|ELSync}` @nonsense \n   - [x] Same as upper case, but with actual stopping/starting of the op-node and not just network issue.

We may directly query the EL using the `eth_getBlockByNumber(\"latest\")` to check that the EL actually reached the unsafe head tip, not relying on the `optimism_syncStatus` result from the op-node.\n\nMore concretely the testing scenario will be\n1. Prepare op-node and EL(with stable ELP2P) which are fully synced, reaching the unsafe tip\n2. Shut op-node down. \n3. Stay for 5 minutes to make the EL(with stable ELP2P) not advance, intentionally making the unsafe gap\n4. Start op-node with\n    - RR Sync disabled (via flag)\n    - Patched to do the EL Sync to fill in the gap\n    - Connected via CLP2P and receiving unsafe payloads from the sequencer\n5. Measure time until the EL(with stable ELP2P) reaches the tip.\n\n\n\n\n",
