([l1_traversal.go](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/84152b267a0787c3f8eba092ce3b687cc8c21463/op-node/rollup/derive/l1_traversal.go#L78-L81) and [system_config.go](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/84152b267a0787c3f8eba092ce3b687cc8c21463/op-node/rollup/derive/system_config.go#L91-L94))\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n<!--\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\n-->\nIf a malformed batcher hash is used on the SystemConfig, it should be a failure to update and maybe also add in a check around version/event where it doesn't know the version, then it's a critical error.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n<!--\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\n-->\nYou can mitigate this with a local build which ignores this error, but is inappropriate for general use.\n\n**Additional context**\n<!--\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\n-->\nWe had one of our partners who was working on a staging network hit this",

So we're testing the contract deployment for cannon-kona and providing valid inputs, but not challenger's ability to actually execute that prestate.\r\n\r\n Currently only interop tests are setting the cannon-kona prestate, but we build both variants.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease describe any tests you've added.
