([l1_traversal.go](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/84152b267a0787c3f8eba092ce3b687cc8c21463/op-node/rollup/derive/l1_traversal.go#L78-L81) and [system_config.go](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/84152b267a0787c3f8eba092ce3b687cc8c21463/op-node/rollup/derive/system_config.go#L91-L94))\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n<!--\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\n-->\nIf a malformed batcher hash is used on the SystemConfig, it should be a failure to update and maybe also add in a check around version/event where it doesn't know the version, then it's a critical error.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n<!--\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\n-->\nYou can mitigate this with a local build which ignores this error, but is inappropriate for general use.\n\n**Additional context**\n<!--\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\n-->\nWe had one of our partners who was working on a staging network hit this",

While the build can take 5-10 minutes we can leverage CircleCI caching to avoid building it when we haven't changed anything about the build process. Additionally it's designed so that the hash is provided to configure games but the prestate itself doesn't have to be available unless tests actually use it (which non currently do). So we're testing the contract deployment for cannon-kona and providing valid inputs, but not challenger's ability to actually execute that prestate.\r\n\r\n Currently only interop tests are setting the cannon-kona prestate, but we build both variants.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease describe any tests you've added.
