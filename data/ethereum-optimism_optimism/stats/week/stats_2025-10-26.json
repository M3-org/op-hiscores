      "body": "Acceptance tests often assume that they have complete ownership of a `*dsl.EOA`, when in fact multiple may be using the same account at the same time. There are three ways to solve this:\n\n1. Strengthen the `*dsl.EOA` abstraction to assume concurrent ownership of the onchain account is possible. This primarily impacts funding and nonce management.\n2. Run all tests serially and assume the account cannot be used concurrently outside of acceptance tests.\n3. Stop writing acceptance tests as normal Go unit tests. Make a custom test runner instead. Then we can compile a single program that contains all of the tests, and runs them in parallel or in sequence. EOA ownership could be regulated through a master wallet object that is injected into each test.\n\nI'm currently leaning toward option 3: it's probably not even that hard to do. It should also help substantially decrease test times in CI, since we should be able to parallelize almost all of our acceptance tests. We can do Option 2 as well to solve problems where transactions sent by a previous owner of an EOA affect its current owner.",

      "author": "sebastianst",
      "number": 18070,
      "repository": "ethereum-optimism/optimism",
      "body": "We have recently introduced the necessity to provide op-node & op-program with the L1 chain config. For known L1s like Mainnet or Sepolia this can be skipped, as it is read automatically from the configs embedded into op-geth.\n\nL3s now have to provide the chain configs of their L2 parent chains like OP/Base sepolia/mainnet. However, for L3s, we don't even strictly need the chain config of their parent chains, because it's currently only used inside derivation to calculate the blob base fee for the L1 attributes. But L2s have blobs disables, so this always results in the trivial value of 1.\n\nTo solve this, I suggest we add a flag like `--l3` that changes some behavior and requirements on other flags, e.g. not requiring the L1 chain config to be provided. Then inside attributes derivation, we can safely just use 1 for the blob base fee if there's no chain config. We could furthermore auto-set the L3 flag if the `L1ChainID` is a known L2 chain ID.\n\nRelated configurability issue for L3s: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18009",
