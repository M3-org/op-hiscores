L2s usually have a block time of 2s, so a sixth of Ethereum's target block time of 12s.\n\nWe could make those constants optionally configurable, or even better make the L1 block time optionally configurable and then adjust these constants accordingly, similar to how the finality loopback is already calculated differently for AltDA chains at\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/cb54822c5e18925498f48d8677b71992bf402631/op-node/rollup/finality/finalizer.go?plain=1#L37-L50\n\nWe could then also auto-detect at startup if a `L1ChainID` is known in the embedded superchain-registry and then load the block time automatically. This way, L3s using e.g. Base or OPM would just work out of the box without additional configuration.\n\nIn a next step we may even consider adding an optional `L1BlockTime` to the rollup config.",
