For version 2 of these contracts, some of this data is no longer accessible on the implementation.  We'll need to find a way to continue validating the dispute game config.  We should be able to just inspect the `DisputeGameFactory.gameArgs` data to validate the parameters that are no longer stored on the implementation.",

The current candidate for this is `op-up`, but probably a few modifications are necessary to make it feasible for local development.\n\n- We want to have a few presets and/or flags/env-vars so that individual components can be turned on or off (e.g. batcher, proposer, challenger, number of validators, op-reth/geth, ...)\n- We want to directly spin up the in-memory sysgo-based components without the need to build a Docker container\n    - We probably want to assign a few static ports (optionally configurable) so developers can reliably find the same components at the same ports. Those could be different than the standard ports.\n- Related: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17941",
