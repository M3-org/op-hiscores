However, if the passed in struct does not have a value explicitly set (eg `MeshDHi`) then the zero value (0 in this case) is used, which replaced the sane default set earlier with `BuildGlobalGossipParams` (12 btw).\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\nn/a - I've given you the exact code that is wrong.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nShould only overwrite these values when non-zero\n\n**Environment Information:**\nn/a\n\n**Configurations:**\nn/a\n\n**Logs:**\nn/a\n\n**Additional context**\nn/a\n\n---\n\n⚠️ **Notice:** Issues that do not include the following sections will be subject to closure:\n- Bug Description\n- Steps to Reproduce\n- Environment Information\n\nPlease ensure all required sections are filled out accurately to expedite the debugging process and improve issue resolution efficiency.",

      "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nEnables OP Stack chains to use an asset other than ETH as their native fee currency by introducing a minimal, flexible, and standardizable Custom Gas Token (CGT) architecture. To do so, it introduces new **predeploys** (`NativeAssetLiquidity` and `LiquidityController`) that decouple native asset management from core bridging operations while using a single `isCustomGasToken()` flag that disables ETH transfer flows in all bridging methods. The two new pre-deploys manage the native asset supply.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\nCore contracts:\r\n\r\n- `OptimismPortal` and `L1Block`: Tests for `isCustomGasToken()` flag blocking ETH deposits/withdrawals\r\n- `NativeAssetLiquidity`: Tests deposit/withdraw access control and functionality\r\n- `LiquidityController`: Tests minter authorization, mint/burn operations, and metadata functions\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\n- Spec: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/749\r\n- Design Doc: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/305\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n  - @0xOneTony\r\n  - @0xniha\r\n  - @agusduha\r\n  - @ashitakah\r\n  - @hexshire\r\n  - @Joxess\r\n  - @tynes",

Furthermore, a secondary configurable parameter, `ResponseDelayAfter`, is also added, which defines the number of responses after which to start applying the delay.\r\n\r\nFinally, the delay configuration is ignored (bypassed) altogether if the current time is already inside the extension period, in order to prevent accidentally waiting beyond the end of a game.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a set of unit tests (see [here](https://github.com/leopoldjoy/optimism/blob/feat/configurable-delay-between-game-responses/op-challenger/game/fault/agent_test.go)) and integration tests (see [here](https://github.com/leopoldjoy/optimism/blob/feat/configurable-delay-between-game-responses/op-e2e/faultproofs/response_delay_test.go)) covering the various cases of these new config parameters.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis new configurable parameter enables intentionally delaying a challenger response to a game in order to make the game progress more slowly.
