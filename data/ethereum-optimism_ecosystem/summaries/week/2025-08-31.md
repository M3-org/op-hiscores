# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on refining the project's structure and modernizing its web presence. A significant repository cleanup was performed by externalizing the `verbs` packages into their own repository. Concurrently, a major new initiative was launched to migrate the Optimism marketing site to a modern Next.js and TypeScript stack, with detailed planning issues opened to guide the effort. This work was complemented by the completion of a branding refresh, with font updates and UI enhancements rolled out across several ecosystem websites.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development this week involved a structural refactoring of the repository to improve focus and maintainability.

- **Repository Restructuring:** The `verbs` service, UI, and SDK packages were removed from the main repository. This work, completed in PR [#946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/946), externalizes this specific functionality into a dedicated repository, streamlining the `ecosystem` codebase.

## üêõ Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
Work was completed on several fronts, primarily focused on improving the user-facing aspects of the ecosystem and its security posture.
- **Branding and UI Consistency:** A series of issues were closed related to a consistent font update across `app.optimism.io`, `docs.optimism.io`, `console.optimism.io`, and `community.optimism.io` ([#922](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/922), [#923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/923), [#924](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/924), [#933](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/933)). The implementation of a Storybook and design system for `optimism.io` was also completed, furthering UI consistency ([#931](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/931)).
- **Site Enhancements & Security:** A Content Security Policy (CSP) was added to `oplabs.co` to improve security ([#934](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/934)), and minor updates were made to `localchain.dev` ([#932](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/932)).

### New & Active Issues
A significant new project was defined, and important technical discussions on protocol support continued.
- **Marketing Site React Migration:** A major new workstream was kicked off to migrate the Optimism marketing site to a modern tech stack. A tracking issue ([#937](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/937)) was created, along with a comprehensive set of sub-tasks for setting up the monorepo ([#938](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/938]), CI/CD ([#939](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/939]), Sanity CMS ([#940](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/940]), Storybook ([#941](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/941)), and shared UI components ([#942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/942), [#943](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/943)).
- **Kona + Cannon Support:** Active discussions are ongoing in issues [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17285) and [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17286) regarding the necessary updates for `OPCM` and `op-dispute-mon` to support the new "Kona + Cannon" game types. The conversation emphasizes that new game types require explicit support and cannot be ignored, ensuring the robustness of the dispute monitoring system.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both strategic planning and deep technical discussions. The creation of a detailed and well-structured set of issues ([#937-#944](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/937)) for the marketing site migration indicates a coordinated planning effort for a major new initiative. On the protocol side, the dialogue between contributors `ajsutton` and `pauldowman` in issues [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17285) and [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17286) highlights the collaborative process of clarifying technical requirements for critical components like the dispute game.
