# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Weekly Report (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development was centered on enhancing the developer experience within the Superchain. A significant new feature, an RCT demo page, was added to the Superchain Playground to better demonstrate cross-chain interoperability. This effort required substantial updates to application utilities and configurations. Concurrently, an important discussion progressed around a proposal for congestion-based transaction reordering, signaling a focus on future protocol scalability and network management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development activity involved a single, comprehensive pull request that introduced a new feature to the Superchain Playground.

- **New RCT Demo for Superchain Playground:** A new demo page was introduced to showcase cross-chain functionality. This feature enhancement involved extensive modifications to the application's routing, providers, and components related to Uniswap actions, token handling, and chain interactions. To support this new page, the `viem` and `utils-app` packages were updated with new ABIs, address sets, and chain configurations, specifically for the `interopAlpha` and `supersim` chains ([#919](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/919)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed this week based on the available data. However, a key strategic discussion continued on an active issue.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - Discussion continued on issue [#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/306), which proposes a design document for **congestion-based builder transaction reordering**. The proposal centers on tracking excess Data Availability (DA) usage and applying an exponential cost penalty to manage network congestion. This mechanism could potentially be tested outside the core protocol before consideration for a future L1 implementation.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was evident in the ongoing technical discussions. The proposal for congestion management in issue [#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/306) attracted new interest, with user `moonfury-ops` expressing a desire to collaborate on the topic. This highlights active participation in shaping the future design and scalability of the ecosystem.
