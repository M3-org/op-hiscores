# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Weekly Report (Nov 30 - 6, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts focused on foundational architecture and developer infrastructure. A key strategic decision was made to integrate support for challenging ZK games directly within the `op-challenger`, resolving a significant research spike. Concurrently, work progressed on standardizing core data structures with discussions continuing on porting the `SuperchainConfig` type into the specifications. These initiatives, along with efforts to unify CI workflows, highlight a period of refining the Superchain's technical underpinnings and improving system integrity.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving continuous integration and laying the groundwork for future protocol enhancements.

*   **CI Workflow Unification**
    A new pull request ([#971](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/971)) was opened to unify local CI workflows and update them to use the latest factory workflow. This effort aims to streamline the development and testing pipeline for contributors.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving a key architectural question and advancing discussions on Superchain configuration.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **ZK Game Challenging Strategy:** Issue [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18322), a spike to determine how to support ZK games, was closed. The team decided to proceed with implementing the necessary logic within the existing `op-challenger`, concluding that its logic is straightforward enough for this integration, even if a Rust-based challenger is considered for the long term.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Superchain Configuration:** Discussions continued in issue [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/741) regarding the porting of the `SuperchainConfig` type from the `superchain-registry` into the specs. A pull request ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/867)) has been opened to address this, marking progress toward a standardized configuration for the Superchain.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the decision-making process around key architectural issues. The resolution of the ZK game challenging spike ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18322)) and the ongoing technical discussion on the `SuperchainConfig` type ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/741)) demonstrate a focused effort among contributors to define and refine core components of the Optimism ecosystem.
