# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on resolving outstanding issues and refining operational strategies, with a strong focus on the `optimism.io` website and core node components. Several key issues concerning the website's architecture, documentation, and migration plans were closed, clearing the path for future development. Additionally, solutions were finalized for an `op-batcher` throttling metric and an `op-geth` initialization problem. While no new code was merged, ongoing discussions indicate a focus on improving the local development experience, particularly around testing with Kurtosis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, there were no new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring efforts merged during this period. The development focus was on issue resolution and planning.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw significant progress in clearing the issue backlog, with no new issues being opened.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Website & Documentation:** A major cleanup of `optimism.io` related issues was completed. This included closing out architectural spikes for the CMS [#930] and a React migration [#929], as well as resolving the docs homepage redesign [#925] and the relayer design doc [#750].
    - **Node Operations & Metrics:** Two key operational issues were resolved. A problem with `op-geth` panicking on large genesis files [#668] was addressed with a strategy to use `stateHash` for snap-syncing. An issue with the `op-batcher` throttling metric [#17149] was closed with the decision to handle visualization directly in Grafana.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened in the observed timeframe.
    - Discussion continued on issue [#16975] regarding the ability to use local `op-geth` builds within Kurtosis. The conversation is exploring using the templating system to automatically override image sources, which would significantly improve the local development and testing workflow for contributors.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The activity this week was characterized by focused discussions aimed at resolving existing technical hurdles and planning architectural improvements. The closure of several issues related to `optimism.io` and node operations suggests effective collaboration in clearing technical debt. The ongoing discussion around local Kurtosis builds [#16975] highlights a commitment to enhancing the developer experience for core contributors.
