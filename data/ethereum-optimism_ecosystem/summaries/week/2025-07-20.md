# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on project refinement and strategic planning rather than new feature development. Significant progress was made in maturing the `verbs` project by preparing it for a standalone deployment, signaling its growing importance. Work also focused on stabilizing Superchain tooling and demos. A key strategic shift was noted in network testing, with the project deprioritizing Kurtosis. Finally, an interaction with an automated agent highlighted an infrastructure blocker, pointing to ongoing efforts to integrate automated tooling into the development workflow.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, there were no new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring merged into the repository during this period. The development focus was on issue management, project planning, and stabilization efforts.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a strong focus on closing out existing issues across several key areas of the ecosystem.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **`verbs` Project Maturation:** The `verbs` project moved closer to becoming a standalone tool with the closure of issues for setting up `verbs-ui` hosting ([#916](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/916)) and migrating the project to its own repository ([#918](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/918)).
    - **Superchain Tooling & Demos:** Progress was made in stabilizing Superchain components, marked by the closure of issues related to the Superchain tools RCT Demo ([#864](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/864)) and the integration of the `interop-alpha` demo app ([#865](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/865)).
    - **Testing Strategy Shift:** A strategic decision was made to deprioritize Kurtosis for network testing in favor of Sysgo. This led to the closure of issue [#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/375), which concerned test target setup as an `op-acceptor` concern.
    - **Infrastructure & Planning:** An infrastructure task to deploy a `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` in op-sepolia ([#16686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16686)) was completed. Additionally, an issue for initial Q4 2024 audit planning ([#1701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/1701)) was resolved.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this week.
    - A notable active discussion occurred in [#15115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/15115), where the `copilot-swe-agent` reported it was blocked from implementing a semgrep rule because GitHub Actions are disabled on the repository. This highlights a potential blocker for automated tooling contributions that needs to be addressed.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in issue management and strategic decision-making. In issue [#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/375), `scharissis` provided important cross-repository context before `teddyknox` made a final decision, demonstrating effective communication and clear ownership. The project is also exploring automated contributions, as seen with the `copilot-swe-agent`'s activity, which provides valuable feedback on the repository's process and infrastructure readiness for such tooling.
