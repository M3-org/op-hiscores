# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Weekly Report (Jun 8 - 14, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on enhancing cross-chain functionality and planning for major new features. Key progress was made on the interoperability front with the integration of `GasTank` event indexing, improving the tracking of gas provider operations. A significant amount of planning took place, evidenced by a large influx of new issues scoping out the development of the Gas Tank relayer system and the SuperStacks claim process. Concurrently, the team continued its deep dive into improving developer experience and stability, with extensive discussions aimed at diagnosing and mitigating CI and acceptance test flakiness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on interoperability enhancements and routine package maintenance.

- **Cross-Chain Interoperability & Gas Tank:**
  To improve the tracking of cross-chain gas operations, new features were added to index `GasTank` events and integrate its ABI. This work establishes new database tables for `gasProviders` and `gasProviderPendingWithdrawals`, providing better visibility into message claims and provider activity ([#833](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/833), [#834](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/834)).

- **Ecosystem Package Maintenance:**
  Several packages received version updates to ensure components remain current. The `supersim` package was updated to `v0.1.0-alpha.50` ([#835](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/835)). Other dependency updates were also released for `ponder-interop`, `viem`, and `wagmi` ([#852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/852), [#853](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/853), [#855](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/855), [#856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/856)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a significant amount of issue creation, signaling active planning for new features, alongside ongoing discussions on core protocol stability and testing.

- **Closed Issues:**
  Several key issues were resolved:
  - **Gas Tank:** The task to index `GasTank` events was completed and closed ([#838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/838)).
  - **Protocol Stability:** An issue causing an `op-supervisor` crash loop due to event overflow was closed, with a new gauge added for future debugging ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16335)).
  - **Tooling & Backend:** A build issue with the `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` package was fixed ([#1146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/1146)), and a backend implementation for a Superstacks endpoint was completed ([#807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/807)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  A large volume of new issues were opened, primarily focused on two new initiatives:
  - **Gas Tank & Relayer System:** A suite of issues was created to build out the Gas Tank system, including contract development ([#836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/836]), fund claiming ([#840](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/840)), and updating the relayer to check for sufficient funds ([#839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/839)). This effort also includes enhancing logging ([#841](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/841), [#842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/842), [#843](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/843)) and alerting ([#844](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/844), [#845](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/845)).
  - **SuperStacks Claim Flow:** Planning for the SuperStacks claim process was detailed in new issues covering backend endpoints ([#849](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/849]), UI cleanup ([#848](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/848]), data integration ([#847](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/847]), and a planned bug bash ([#851](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/851)).

  Key ongoing discussions include:
  - **CI & Test Flakiness:** A major focus remains on improving test reliability ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16271), [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16378)). Analysis suggests most flakiness stems from infrastructure rather than the tests themselves. A new "Flakiness Report" generator has been introduced to help better identify sources of instability.
  - **Fault Proofs:** Detailed planning continues for the Fault Proof creator contract, with a comprehensive checklist of tasks being discussed to support OPCM changes ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/15789)).
  - **Incorrect Nonce:** An older issue regarding an incorrect nonce from `eth_getTransactionCount` ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/623)) continues to see activity from users requesting updates, highlighting its importance to the community.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week demonstrated strong internal collaboration and planning. The extensive discussions around CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16271), [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16378)) involved multiple team members sharing detailed analysis and creating new tooling to address the problem collectively. The structured breakdown of tasks for the Fault Proof creator contract ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/15789)) and the coordinated creation of issues for the Gas Tank and SuperStacks features indicate a methodical approach to scoping and distributing upcoming work. Additionally, continued community engagement is evident from the follow-ups on the `eth_getTransactionCount` nonce issue ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/623)), underscoring the project's active user base.
