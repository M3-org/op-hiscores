# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Weekly Report (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant planning and groundwork for future development, with a strong focus on enhancing the user experience across Optimism's web properties. While no new code was merged, a large batch of issues was created to orchestrate a major overhaul of the documentation site, the main optimism.io website, and the developer console. In parallel, progress was made on existing technical discussions, including the refinement of the event system and strategies for improving chain configuration validation. The closure of an issue related to implementing a "lend" verb also marked the conclusion of a key planning phase.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No pull requests were merged during the reported period, indicating a focus on planning and issue management rather than code implementation.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Activity this week centered on defining future work and advancing discussions on existing technical challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Lending Verb Implementation:** The planning phase for a new "lend" verb was completed with the closure of issue [#915](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/915). The issue outlined the necessary steps, including wrapping the Morpho SDK and defining API endpoints for lending operations.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Major Web Property Overhaul:** A coordinated effort began to modernize Optimism's web presence. New issues were opened to plan a complete homepage redesign ([#925](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/925)) and a new navigation structure ([#926](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/926)) for the documentation site. Foundational work for the main optimism.io site is also underway, with issues created to investigate a new CMS architecture ([#930](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/930)) and a potential migration to React ([#929](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/929)).
    - **Branding and UI Enhancements:** To align with a new brand kit, issues were created to update the fonts on `docs.optimism.io` ([#923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/923)) and `console.optimism.io` ([#924](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/924)). Additionally, a new feature to add heatmap metrics to the localchain interface was proposed in [#927](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/927).
    - **Ongoing Technical Discussions:**
        - Progress continues on refining the event system in [#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17001), with an expected resolution by August 21.
        - Discussion was revived in [#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/686) regarding the addition of negative testing for chain configurations to improve validation code robustness.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the strategic planning and discussion around long-standing issues. The creation of a large, interconnected set of issues for the web property redesigns points to a coordinated effort within the front-end team. Furthermore, the discussion on issue [#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/686) involved multiple team members (@alfonso-op, @bitwiseguy, @geoknee, and Tess), highlighting ongoing collaboration to address foundational code quality and testing strategies.
