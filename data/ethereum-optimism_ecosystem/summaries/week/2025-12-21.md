# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Weekly Report (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development activity centered on enhancing core protocol components and improving development infrastructure. A key milestone was reached for the `op-node` light client, which now fully supports following external sources for safe and finalized data. Concurrently, efforts to modernize the CI/CD pipeline progressed with a new initiative to migrate Docker builds to GitHub Actions. Ongoing discussions around the `op-challenger` component underscore a continued focus on the correctness and security of the fault-proof system.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work was initiated to streamline the project's build and deployment processes.

*   **CI/CD Infrastructure Migration**
    *   A pull request ([#972](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/972)) was opened to complete the migration of Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions, aiming to consolidate and improve the continuous integration pipeline.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of a key `op-node` feature and continued deep-dive discussions on the fault-proof mechanism.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **`op-node` Light Client:** Issue [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18317) was closed, confirming the completion of the `op-node` implementation that allows the light client to follow external sources via the `--l2.follow.source` flag.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   No new issues were opened during this period.
    *   Discussion remains active on `op-challenger` trace output ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18643)). Recent updates confirm that the super node trace provider now functions correctly. However, the issue will stay open until an integration test is added to verify the alignment between `op-challenger` and `op-program`, highlighting a commitment to rigorous testing of the fault-proof system. It was also noted that a related fix for `op-supervisor` is no longer necessary as the component is being deprecated.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the focused technical discussions on active issues. The ongoing conversation around `op-challenger` in issue [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18643) demonstrates detailed review and cross-component consideration, ensuring that changes are validated through integration testing before closure.
