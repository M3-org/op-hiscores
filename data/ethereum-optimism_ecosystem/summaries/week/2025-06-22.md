# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Weekly Report (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant advancements in Superchain interoperability, with a major focus on building out the `GasTank` functionality for automated cross-chain message relaying. Development on the autorelayer and supporting APIs saw substantial progress, enabling automated fund checking and claims processing. Alongside this, a large-scale effort to refine and streamline Superchain-Ops tooling concluded, closing numerous issues and improving the operational workflow. While new features were rolled out, the team also dedicated effort to investigating critical performance and stability issues in core components like `op-geth`, `op-batcher`, and `op-node`, with active community participation in diagnostics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This week's completed work focused on enhancing Superchain interoperability and refining developer tooling.

- **GasTank Interoperability Enhancements:** A series of pull requests significantly built out the automated systems for cross-chain interactions.
  - The `GasTank` ABI was updated in Viem to align with the latest `interop-lib` ([#863](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/863)).
  - The autorelayer was improved to only process messages that have sufficient funds in the GasTank, preventing failed relays ([#861](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/861), [#875](https://github
