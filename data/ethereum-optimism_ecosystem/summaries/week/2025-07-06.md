# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Weekly Report (Jul 6 - 12, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development was characterized by two major efforts: significant enhancements to the interop relayer infrastructure and the finalization of the Superstacks Mini App. The team made substantial progress on `autorelayer-interop` and `ponder-interop`, implementing more accurate gas provider balance calculations by accounting for pending withdrawals and claims. In parallel, a large number of issues related to the Superstacks Mini App were closed, covering UI, backend logic, and deployment, signaling that the feature is approaching production readiness. The week also saw important maintenance work, including improving test reliability and investigating a performance issue in `op-geth`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The core technical work focused on improving the accuracy and functionality of the cross-chain relayer system.

- **Interop Relayer Gas Management:** A series of updates were made to `autorelayer-interop` and `ponder-interop` to provide more precise gas balance management for relayers.
    - To better account for in-flight costs, the system was updated to factor in pending withdrawals when calculating a gas provider's available balance ([#879](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/879), [#883](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/883)).
    - A new API endpoint was added to `ponder-interop` to fetch pending claims, which `autorelayer-interop` now uses to deduct unclaimed relay costs from the gas provider's balance ([#886](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/886), [#887](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/887)).
    - Following a `GasTank` ABI update, the logic was changed to specify the `GasProvider` at the time of relay rather than at the time of claim, ensuring correct relay receipt generation ([#889](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/889), [#890](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/890), [#891](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/891)).

- **Package Versioning and Releases:** As part of routine maintenance, new versions were published for several packages, including `autorelayer-interop`, `ponder-interop`, `supersim` ([#888](https://github.comcom/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/888), [#892](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/892)), `sponsored-sender`, `superchain-playground`, `viem`, and `wagmi` ([#895](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/895), [#897](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/897), [#898](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/898)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Superstacks Mini App & Airdrop 6:** A significant number of issues were resolved for the Superstacks Mini App, marking a major push towards completion. This included work on the WorldID scope ([#827](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/827)), production deployment configuration ([#866](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/866)), claim flow UI ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/867)), backend delegation checks ([#849](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/849)), and the resolution of bugbash findings ([#872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/872)). An issue with the Airdrop 6 event log poller was also fixed ([#850](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/850)).
    - **Stability and Prioritization:** An issue regarding acceptance test reliability was closed, indicating stability improvements ([#16378
