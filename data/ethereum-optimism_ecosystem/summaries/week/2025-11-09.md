# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing development infrastructure and resolving outstanding technical debt. Key progress was made in bolstering the CI/CD pipeline with new GitHub Actions workflows for building and attesting Docker images. Concurrently, several long-standing issues related to documentation, Kona compatibility, and `op-program` functionality were closed. Active discussions point towards future infrastructure shifts, including the potential deprecation of the Kurtosis testing framework and necessary adaptations for the upcoming dispute-game v2.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The primary development this week focused on improving the project's continuous integration and deployment capabilities.

- **CI/CD Enhancements for Docker Builds:** New GitHub Actions workflows were introduced to build and attest Docker images for several ecosystem components, including `ecosystem-ponder-interop`, `ecosystem-autorelayer-interop`, and `ecosystem-sponsored-sender`. This change ([#970](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/970)) complements the existing CircleCI builds, strengthening the project's deployment pipeline.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
Several issues were resolved, cleaning up the backlog and improving tooling and documentation:
- **Documentation:** An issue to implement a new navigation structure for the documentation site was closed ([#926](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/926)).
- **Tooling & Compatibility:**
    - Kona compatibility with WebSocket URLs in acceptance tests was resolved following a tool update ([#18203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18203)).
    - The task to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program` was completed and closed ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17416)).

### New & Active Issues
No new issues were opened this week. However, significant discussions on active issues are shaping future development:
- **Testing Infrastructure:** A discussion on [#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16704) indicates that Kurtosis, used for `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack`, is being considered for deprecation, signaling a potential shift in the project's testing strategy.
- **Dispute Game v2:** Work is underway to update reporting scripts for compatibility with dispute-game v2. Discussions in [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/1148) highlight the need to adapt to changes in game arguments and JSON output formats.
- **Kona Enhancements:** A fix is under review for [#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18271), which tracks the effort to add support for embedded custom prestates to the Kona tool.
