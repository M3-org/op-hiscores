# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Weekly Report (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were centered on strategic planning and critical issue investigation rather than code implementation. Discussions advanced key initiatives for improving the Superchain ecosystem's stability and developer experience. Significant conversations took place around defining CI pipeline SLAs, automating release processes for OP Stack components, and enhancing interoperability testing with tools like `supersim`. Concurrently, the team actively investigated severe bugs, including a goroutine leak in `op-node` and an event overflow issue in `op-supervisor`, underscoring a strong focus on protocol health and reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring were merged this week. All progress was made through discussions and planning within GitHub issues, laying the groundwork for future development work.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Activity this week was concentrated on discussing and triaging active issues. No issues were closed or newly opened.

### New & Active Issues

Discussions this week fell into three main categories: tooling automation, Superchain interoperability, and bug investigation.

**Tooling & Automation:**
*   **CI Pipeline SLAs ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16437)):** A detailed framework was proposed to establish Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for the CI pipeline. The proposal aims to create clear expectations and accountability by defining metrics for availability (95% job success rate), performance (80% of pipelines under 1 hour), and developer experience.
*   **Release Automation ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16097)):** The conversation on automating releases for `op-node`, `batcher`, and other components continued. The focus is on creating a "one-click solution" for generating high-quality changelogs, with suggestions to use `git cliff` and integrate the tooling into `op-workbench`, while maintaining a "monorepo-first perspective."

**Superchain Interoperability & Testing:**
*   **`supersim` Enhancements ([#361](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/361), [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/399)):** Discussions clarified the role of `supersim` as a lightweight tool for local multi-chain application development, distinct from heavier Kurtosis devnets. A proposal was made to add a `--dependency-set` flag to make L2 chain dependencies configurable during testing.
*   **Trivial Interop Mode for `op-node` ([#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16519)):** A debate emerged around enabling `op-node` to run in an interop mode without a supervisor. While concerns were raised about potential future upgrade complexities, the change was framed as a temporary measure to reduce operational churn for chain operators with simple dependency sets.
*   **Acceptance Tests ([#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/398)):** Progress was made on running acceptance tests in persistent devnets with the addition of L1 Faucet support.

**Bug Investigation & Stability:**
*   **`op-node` Goroutine Leak ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16332)):** The severity of a bug causing `op-node` sync issues was reinforced when another user confirmed experiencing thousands of goroutines getting stuck, primarily in I/O wait or `yamux` session handlers.
*   **`op-supervisor` Event Overflow ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16335)):** Investigation into `op-supervisor` crashes continued. The focus has broadened from a single event type to consider that multiple "cross-unsafe-update" events might be stacking up. Work is underway to add counters for each event type to aid future debugging.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted active collaboration among core contributors on foundational issues. Discussions in issues like [#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16519) (Trivial Interop Mode) and [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16097) (Release Automation) showcased healthy debate, with team members like `sebastianst`, `inphi`, `geoknee`, and `protolambda` weighing different technical trade-offs. The confirmation of the `op-node` goroutine leak in [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16332) by `Creamers158` demonstrates valuable community feedback in identifying and confirming the impact of critical bugs.
