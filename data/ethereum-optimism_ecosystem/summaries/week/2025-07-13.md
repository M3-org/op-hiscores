# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by the rapid incubation of a new "verbs" proof-of-concept SDK, which progressed from initial setup to include wallet integration, a user interface, and querying capabilities. Significant strides were also made in enhancing infrastructure robustness, evidenced by the closure of several long-standing issues related to sequencer stability and error recovery. Concurrently, the team advanced support for sponsored messages and engaged in critical discussions around improving interop testing to better mirror production environments, ensuring the continued security and reliability of the OP Stack.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on building out new developer-focused tooling and enhancing core functionalities like sponsored message relaying.

- **"Verbs" Project Incubation:** A new proof-of-concept project, "verbs," saw rapid development. The week began with the initial SDK setup ([#901]) and quickly expanded to include comprehensive wallet integration with Privy ([#908]). To support development, a dedicated Vite-based UI was created ([#911]), and the service was enhanced with an endpoint to query all created wallets ([#914]). Towards the end of the week, work began to migrate the entire `verbs` project into its own standalone repository ([#918]).

- **Sponsored Message Support:** The ecosystem's messaging capabilities were enhanced to support sponsored messages. The API was updated to allow fetching these messages via the `/messages/pending` endpoint ([#899]), and the `autorelayer-interop` was upgraded to relay them based on a new configuration setting ([#900]).

- **Bug Fixes and Maintenance:** A critical bug was fixed in the relayer where `BigInt` values were being incorrectly serialized as numbers; they are now correctly handled as strings ([#902]). Routine package versioning was also performed for `ponder-interop` and `autorelayer-interop` ([#903], [#904], [#909]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week involved significant issue triage, closing out old infrastructure problems and opening new ones to guide the development of the "verbs" project and other tooling improvements.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Infrastructure Stability:** Several long-standing, critical issues concerning sequencer stability were closed, including recovery from sequence window expiration ([#11228]) and sequencer halting on temporary L1 errors ([#12240]), signaling major improvements in infrastructure resilience.
    - **"Verbs" Project Milestones:** Issues related to the initial setup of the `verbs` package ([#905]), wallet integration ([#906]), and the creation of a demo UI ([#910]) were all closed, marking swift progress.
    - **Test Porting & Cleanup:** Progress was made on acceptance tests, with the closure of issues for porting `TestChainFork` ([#413]) and `TestERC20Bridge` ([#415]). An issue identifying duplicate code in `op-batcher` was also resolved ([#16677]).
    - **Configuration Decisions:** Discussions concluded on builder deployment strategies, deciding to forgo NVMe nodes for now and keep flashblocks components within the main sequencer namespace ([#16689], [#16690]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **"Verbs" Next Steps:** A clear roadmap for the `verbs` project was laid out through new issues, including implementing a "lend" verb ([#915]), setting up hosting for the UI and service ([#916]), and migrating the project to a standalone repository ([#918]).
    - **Interop Testing Focus:** Discussions on active issues highlighted a focus on improving interop test coverage. Key topics included enhancing the `op-sync-tester` with better session management ([#16452]), designing an E2E test for transaction reinjection during reorgs ([#16656]), and ensuring the test topology for interop devnets accurately reflects production environments ([#16746]).
    - **Block Explorer Migration:** A new initiative was created to track the migration from Etherscan to Blockscout across the repository ([#917]).
    - **Ongoing Bug Investigation:** The team continues to investigate an intermittent bug where invalid interop transactions are conditionally included in the `txpool` ([#635]), with detailed reproduction steps provided to aid debugging.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week showcased strong collaboration on both new initiatives and long-term stability efforts. The rapid development of the "verbs" project suggests a focused and efficient effort by the core team.

Discussions on active issues revealed deep technical engagement. For instance, @protolambda and @pcw109550 held a detailed debate on the optimal design for session management in the `op-sync-tester` ([#16452]). Similarly, @maurelian facilitated a discussion with auditors regarding contract verification redundancy ([#16653]), demonstrating a commitment to security and best practices. The closure of several very old infrastructure issues by `mslipper` indicates a concerted effort to triage the backlog and solidify the stability of the core protocol.
