## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node EL Sync Mode Stuck
Discussion continues on an issue where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart when Reth has already synced data ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18468)). The latest comment suggests a temporary fix: changing the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restarting `op-node`. This issue is impacting Base Mainnet nodes configured for execution layer syncing.
