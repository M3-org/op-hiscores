## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node EL Sync Mode Stuck
Discussion continues on an issue where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart when reth has already synced data. A user reported experiencing the same issue on their Base Mainnet node and suggested a temporary fix: changing the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restarting `op-node`.
