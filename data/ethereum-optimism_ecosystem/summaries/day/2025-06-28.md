## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Abnormal CPU Usage in op-geth
Discussions continued on [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/613) regarding abnormal CPU usage with op-geth v1.101511.0. Community member jsvisa provided detailed instructions on how to capture pprof metrics to diagnose the CPU consumption, suggesting that the high usage might be temporary due to log indexing rebuilds. cpuchainorg inquired about the pprof command line arguments and noted that the issue persists even after index upgrades, suggesting a potential goroutine problem. hekich mentioned that after an index upgrade, CPU usage returned to normal, indicating the upgrade process might be the cause.
