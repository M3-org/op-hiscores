## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interoperability Configuration Validation
Discussion continued on [#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/15765) regarding the validation of `CrossL2Inbox` configuration for interop. Ajsutton commented that the execution client is not well-suited for this validation and that the genesis generation process in `op-deployer` already handles the correct inclusion of interop contracts based on whether multiple chains are present. This suggests the issue might be mitigated by tooling rather than requiring client-side checks.

### Automated Release Pipeline for OP Stack Components
On [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16097), the conversation revolved around using GoReleaser for `op-node`, `batcher`, `proposer`, and `challenger` release pipelines. Geoknee suggested a lighter-weight solution for changelog generation using `git cliff` and emphasized the desire for a one-click solution for high-quality, accurate changelogs.

### `op-node` Goroutine Leak Investigation
Issue [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16332) saw Creamers158 confirm experiencing the same problem with `op-node` v1.13.3, where thousands of goroutines get stuck, primarily in `select`, `IO wait`, or `yamux` session handlers, leading to sync issues. This reinforces the severity and reproducibility of the bug.

### `op-supervisor` Event Overflow
Discussions on [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16335) focused on the `op-supervisor` crashing due to event overflow. Sebastianst clarified that `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` was initially suspected but might not be the sole culprit, suggesting that "cross-unsafe-update" events could be stacking up. Nonsense is working on adding a counter per event type to better debug future occurrences, acknowledging that other event types might be causing the issue.

### Acceptance Tests for Persistent Devnets
On [#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/398), serpixel reported adding L1 Faucet support, which is a step towards getting all acceptance tests running and passing in persistent devnets.

### Clarifying `supersim` vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet
Issue [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/399) saw tremarkley explain that `supersim` is a lighter-weight wrapper around Anvil, primarily used for local development and testing multichain/interop applications. This clarifies its distinction from interop Kurtosis devnets, which are used for testing the chains themselves.
