# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Jul 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the relayer functionality within the ecosystem, specifically updating how GasProvider is specified during message relaying. This includes updates to `autorelayer-interop` and `ponder-interop` to align with the new `GasTank` ABI.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Relayer GasProvider Updates
Significant updates were implemented to modify how the `GasProvider` is specified during message relaying. This change, driven by a recent `GasTank` ABI update, ensures that the `GasProvider` is specified at the time of relay rather than claim, which is crucial for relay receipt generation. This involved changes across multiple components, including the `autorelayer-interop` and `ponder-interop` applications.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: check EL prestate for pre-interop CrossL2Inbox configuration fault
This issue, concerning the presence of `CrossL2Inbox` in the L2 genesis state for chains not actively using interop, was closed today. The latest comment from ajsutton indicates that the execution client is not the ideal place for this validation due to dependency and world state availability challenges. It was argued that the genesis generation process, specifically `op-deployer`, has been improved to automatically handle the inclusion of `CrossL2Inbox` based on whether multiple chains are present, thereby mitigating the risk of incorrect genesis generation. The conclusion is that the problem has been addressed through tooling improvements rather than requiring additional checks within `op-geth` or `op-reth`.
