- **`op-challenger` Trace Output Review**
  Discussion continued on [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18643) regarding the `op-challenger`'s trace output when the next super root is not found. The latest comment from ajsutton confirms that this now works correctly in the super node trace provider. It was noted that `op-supervisor` does not need fixing as it is being deleted, but the issue will remain open until an integration test confirms `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier, Inphi identified this as a real problem, noting that `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash with insufficient data and questioned the correctness of the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test.
- **`op-node` Light CL: Follow External Source**
  Issue [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18317) was closed today, with pcw109550 confirming that the `op-node` implementation for the light client to follow an external source is complete. This feature allows `op-node` to support `--l2.follow.source` to mirror external safe/finalized feeds.
