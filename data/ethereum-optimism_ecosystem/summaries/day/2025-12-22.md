## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#972](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/972), was opened to complete the migration of Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### op-node Light Client External Following
The issue [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18317), concerning the `op-node`'s light client following external sources for safe/finalized data, has been closed. The goal was to implement support for the `--l2.follow.source` flag, and the `op-node` implementation is now complete.

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-challenger Trace Output Review
Discussion continued on [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18643), which addresses reviewing the correct trace output in `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found. The latest comment from ajsutton confirms that this now works correctly in the super node trace provider. It also notes that a fix for `op-supervisor` is not needed as it is being deleted, but the issue should remain open until an integration test confirms `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Previous comments highlighted that the `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash on the first chain with insufficient data and questioned the correctness of a specific test related to `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead`.
