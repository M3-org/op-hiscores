# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Jul 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `ponder-interop` and `autorelayer-interop` applications by adding new API endpoints for pending claims and integrating these into gas provider balance calculations. Several package versions were also updated.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Gas Provider Claim Management
A new API endpoint was added to `ponder-interop` to fetch pending claims for gas providers, improving visibility into outstanding relay costs. This functionality was then integrated into `autorelayer-interop` to accurately deduct unclaimed relays from gas provider balances, ensuring more precise balance calculations.
