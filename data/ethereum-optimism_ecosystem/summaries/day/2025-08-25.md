# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Aug 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the closure of several long-standing issues related to protocol mechanics and logging, alongside the creation of new issues focusing on UI/UX improvements for optimism.io and localchain.dev.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Protocol Mechanics and Event Handling
An issue concerning the implementation of a claim contract deployment process for a mini-app was closed [#868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/868). Additionally, a tracking issue related to consensus influencing event nonces was closed, with the decision not to implement it for the time being [#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/13543).

### Logging and Debugging Improvements
An issue regarding the tracing of event flow in `op-service` was closed, as similar functionality is already present in another pull request [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16874). Another issue focused on cleaning up logging in `op-up` was closed, as it was deemed not worthwhile without `op-geth` eliminating all use of the global logger [#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17007).

### Postmortem and Test Log Resolution
A postmortem issue related to a Scalar fix was closed, indicating the work was completed [#17012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17012). An issue concerning missing test logs in `op-acceptance-tests` was also closed, as the logs were successfully located [#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17151).

## NEW ISSUES

### UI/UX Enhancements
New issues were opened to implement a storybook and design system for optimism.io [#931](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/931) and to add Atlas to localchain.dev while making its logo clickable [#932](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/932).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Event Call Graph in op-service
Issue [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16874) discusses adding logic to trace event flow. The latest comment from mslipper indicates that similar functionality exists elsewhere, leading to its closure. Earlier, pcw109550 noted that the team is leaning towards removing the entire event system, making this specific contribution unlikely to be merged, though the code might be used for control flow analysis.

### op-up: clean up logging
Issue [#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17007) addresses problems encountered with filtering `op-geth` logs. The latest comment from joshklop suggests that cleaning up logging in `op-up` is not worthwhile unless `op-geth` eliminates its use of the global logger.

### op-acceptance-tests: Missing test logs
Issue [#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17151) highlights missing logs for failed tests in CI runs. The latest comment from janjakubnanista confirms that the logs have been found. Earlier, scharissis clarified that the workflow job in question is not meant for acceptance tests and that a separate PR is in progress to move these tests, which should resolve the logging issue.
