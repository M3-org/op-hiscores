## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Sync Tester Enhancements and Session Management**
Discussions on [#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16452) focused on improving the `op-sync-tester` for long-range L2 consensus-layer sync testing. @protolambda and @pcw109550 debated session management, with @pcw109550 proposing a `sync_init` RPC and UUID-based session IDs for multiple chain configurations. @protolambda suggested using HTTP middleware to process requests and attach session info to the context, preferring a URL-based session identifier to avoid special `sync_init` steps.

**Reviewing `VerifyOPCM` and `DeployImplementations` Relationship**
On [#16653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16653), @maurelian discussed the relationship between `VerifyOPCM.s.sol` and `DeployImplementations.s.sol`. Auditors felt `VerifyOPCM` provides valuable redundancy and acts as a check against modifications to `DeployImplementations`. A suggested approach is to re-run `DeployImplementations` within `VerifyOPCM` alongside other checks.

**E2E Testing for Invalid Interop Transaction Reinjection**
Issue [#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16656) addresses the need for an E2E test to confirm that interop transactions are re-checked when a block is reorged and transactions are reinjected into the mempool. @pcw109550 suggested using `op-test-sequencer` to force invalid execution messages and then verify that the invalid message block is reorged, the new L2 blocks do not contain invalid interop transactions, and the mempool is clear of the invalid transaction.

**Stress Testing Interop Expiry Window**
Discussion on [#15285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/15285) revolved around stress testing the interop expiry window. @pauldowman clarified that the "consolidation step" refers to the final stage in the fault proof program where the validity of executing messages is checked after derivation. While a microbenchmark has been done, the need for a worst-case scenario test on actual interop-enabled chains was reiterated to ensure no surprises.

**Identifying Duplicate Code in `op-batcher`**
On [#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16677), @chuwt identified potential duplicate code in `op-batcher`, specifically questioning if `checkTxpool` is still needed in `driver.go` given that `publishStateToL1` already performs this check. @geoknee acknowledged the observation and welcomed a PR to address it.
