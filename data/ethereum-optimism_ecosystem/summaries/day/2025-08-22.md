## NEW ISSUES
### Documentation Site Redesign & Enhancements
Several new issues were opened to plan significant updates to the docs.optimism.io site. This includes implementing a new navigation structure ([#926](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/926)), a complete homepage redesign ([#925](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/925)), and adding a one-click-deploy banner and project card to the homepage ([#928](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/928)).
### Font Updates for Optimism Web Properties
Issues were created to update the font across key Optimism web properties to align with a new brand kit. This includes updates for docs.optimism.io ([#923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/923)) and console.optimism.io ([#924](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/924)).
### Optimism.io Website Modernization
Planning has begun for a significant overhaul of the main optimism.io website, with new issues opened to spike the CMS architecture ([#930](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/930)) and explore a React migration ([#929](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/929)).
### Localchain Interface Improvement
A new issue was opened to add heatmap metrics to the localchain.optimism.io interface ([#927](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/927)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Validation: Add Chain Config Negative Testing ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/686))
The discussion on this issue, which aims to improve the robustness of validation code by adding negative testing for chain configurations, saw a recent comment from @alfonso-op on August 22, 2025. He suggested a follow-up chat with @bitwiseguy and Tess to review if any "not planned" validation tests should still be implemented. Earlier, @alfonso-op had tasked @bitwiseguy (December 11, 2024) with creating sub-issues for specific validation tests. @geoknee (November 25, 2024) previously outlined a strategy to move complexity into pure functions for easier testing and to increase code coverage, noting the brittleness of TOML file parsing.
