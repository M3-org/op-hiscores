## CLOSED ISSUES
### Documentation and Website Architecture
Several issues related to the Optimism documentation and website architecture were closed. This includes the closure of the "Relayer design doc" [#750](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/750), "Implement Docs Homepage redesign" [#925](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/925), "Spike optimism.io CMS architecture" [#930](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/930), and "Spike optimism.io react migration" [#929](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/929).

### op-batcher Throttling Metric Improvement
The issue concerning the improvement of the op-batcher throttling intensity metric was closed [#17149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17149). The discussion concluded with a solution to handle the metric visualization in Grafana by only plotting values greater than 0.

### op-geth Genesis File Handling
The issue regarding `op-geth` initialization with a large genesis file and a LevelDB panic was closed [#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/668). The resolution involved a strategy to avoid saving the large `genesis.json` directly and instead leverage the `stateHash` attribute for snap-syncing.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Kurtosis: Ability to use local op-geth build
Discussion on [#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16975) focused on enabling Kurtosis to use local `op-geth` builds. The latest comment suggests leveraging the templating system to automatically override image sources, potentially by constructing Docker image URLs from `go.mod` githashes or by building local Docker images from cloned source code.
