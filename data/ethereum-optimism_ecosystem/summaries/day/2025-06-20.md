### Release Pipeline Automation Discussions
Discussions on [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16097) continued regarding the use of GoReleaser for `op-node`/`batcher`/`proposer`/`challenger` release pipelines. The latest comment from geoknee on June 26th suggests integrating automated release note generation into `op-workbench` for a "one-click solution." Earlier comments from June 20th by geoknee emphasized committing the changelog generation solution to the codebase for consistency. Protolambda's earlier comments (May 23rd) highlighted the need to unify build systems and avoid adding more disparate methods, advocating for a "monorepo-first perspective" for GoReleaser implementation.

### Trivial Interop Mode for op-node
Issue [#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16519) discusses enabling a "trivial-interop mode" for `op-node` without a supervisor. The latest comment from sebastianst on June 23rd clarifies that chains can run a supervisor weeks before a depset merge, and this change aims to prevent churn for chain operators with trivial depsets in the coming months. Inphi's comment from June 20th questioned the rationale, expressing concern that not running a supervisor might complicate future upgrades to an existing interop cluster.
