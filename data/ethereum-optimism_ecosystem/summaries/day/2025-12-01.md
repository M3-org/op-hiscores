## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **ZK Game Challenging Strategy**
  Issue [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18322), "SPIKE: Decide how to support challenging ZK games," was closed today. The decision was made to proceed with supporting ZK games within `op-challenger`. Earlier discussions noted that the challenger logic is straightforward and could be easily reimplemented in `op-challenger`, with the possibility of using a Rust challenger in the long term.
- **SuperchainConfig Type Porting**
  Discussions continued on issue [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/741), "Port `SuperchainConfig` type from superchain-registry." Himess confirmed opening a PR ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/867)) after incorporating feedback from emhane regarding the notation, emphasizing that it should not use Go syntax and referencing existing type definitions in the specs. Himess had previously submitted a commit for review, documenting the `SuperchainDefinition` type based on the `superchain-registry` code.
