## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **ZK Game Challenging Strategy**
  Issue [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18322), "SPIKE: Decide how to support challenging ZK games," was closed today. The decision was made to proceed with supporting ZK games within `op-challenger`. Earlier discussions noted that the challenger logic is straightforward enough for reimplementation in `op-challenger`, even if a Rust-based challenger might be used long-term.

- **SuperchainConfig Type Porting**
  Discussions continued on issue [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/741), "Port `SuperchainConfig` type from superchain-registry." The latest update indicates that changes have been made and a pull request, [#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/867), has been opened. Previously, a comment highlighted that the notation for the type definition should not use Go syntax and provided a reference for the correct format.
