The day saw significant progress in developer tooling with the addition of a UI for the `verbs-service`, enhancing visual tracking of feature development. Several issues related to wallet integration and UI development for the `verbs` project were closed, indicating a push towards improved developer experience. New issues were opened concerning migration to Blockscout and further `verbs` functionality.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
