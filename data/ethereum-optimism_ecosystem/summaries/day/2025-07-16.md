# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Jul 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in bug fixes related to BigInt serialization in the relayer and the integration of wallet functionality into the verbs-sdk, alongside routine package versioning. Several critical infrastructure issues were closed, and new issues were opened to enhance the verbs ecosystem.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Relayer Bug Fixes and Ponder API Updates
A critical bug affecting BigInt serialization in the relayer was fixed, ensuring proper data handling. This involved updating all Ponder API endpoints to serialize `BigInt`s as `String`s instead of `Number`s, which is the correct approach for large integer values.
- [#902](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/902)

### Verbs SDK Wallet Integration
The `verbs-sdk` now includes comprehensive wallet integration. This involved establishing configuration and types for the SDK, creating a `Wallet` class, integrating with Privy as the initial wallet adapter, and extending the `verbs-service` to utilize the new SDK.
- [#908](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/908)

### Package Versioning
Routine package versioning was performed, updating `autorelayer-interop` and `ponder-interop` to their latest versions.
- [#909](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/909)

## NEW ISSUES

### Verbs Ecosystem Development
New issues were opened to further develop the `verbs` ecosystem, focusing on user interface and wallet management.
- [#910](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/910): Create a `verbs-demo` UI repository to facilitate testing and visualization of `verbs` functionality.
- [#913](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/913): Add an endpoint to the `verbs` service to list all created wallets, enhancing wallet management capabilities.
- [#912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/912): Configure hosting for `verbs-ui` and `verbs-service` to make them publicly accessible.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Recovery from Sequence Window Expiration Incident
Issue [#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/11228) was closed on Jul 16, 2025, with `mslipper` stating, "Closing this for now. Please reopen if it's still relevant." This issue, which discussed the recovery process when the `op-batcher` stops batch submission and the sequence window expires, had seen previous discussions about the implementation of "incident mode" (now "recover mode") and potential batcher changes. `geoknee` had previously noted that `incident mode` was implemented and questioned if the issue should be closed given that some manual intervention is expected for such rare events.

### Sequencer Halting on Temporary Error
Issue [#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/12240) was also closed on Jul 16, 2025, by `mslipper` with the comment, "Closing this for now. Please reopen if this issue still persists." This issue described instances where the sequencer would halt due to temporary errors, including when the L1 becomes unavailable. Earlier discussions involved `emilianobonassi` noting similar sequencer halts and `sebastianst` providing a potential fix and a docker image for testing.

### Update NPM Package: @eth-optimism/contracts-bedrock
Issue [#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/13459) was closed on Jul 16, 2025, by `mslipper` who clarified, "Hi there - we are no longer updating the NPM packages." This resolves the user's request for an update to the `@eth-optimism/contracts-bedrock` package.
