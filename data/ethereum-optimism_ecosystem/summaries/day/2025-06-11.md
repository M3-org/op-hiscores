## NEW ISSUES
### Gas Tank Development
- New issues were opened to track the development of the Gas Tank contract [#836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/836), including indexing related events [#838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/838), and setting up a job to claim funds after successful relaying [#840](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/840).
### Relayer Enhancements
- An issue was created to update the relayer to only process messages for which the gas tank has sufficient funds [#839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/839).
### Logging and Alerting Improvements
- Several issues were opened to enhance logging for the relayer [#841](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/841), sponsored sender [#842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/842), and Ponder [#843](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/843).
- New issues also address alerting for failed relays [#844](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/844) and low balances on sponsored sender workers [#845](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/845).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Improving Acceptance Test Reliability
Discussions on [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16378) focused on making acceptance tests consistently reliable. It was noted that some tests, like those in `op-acceptance-tests/tests/interop/reorgs`, pass with multiple runs (`-count=5`), suggesting they are not currently actionable. The `multisupervisor_interop` package was identified as potentially flaky when all tests within it run together, with `TestUnsafeChainUnknownToL2CL` and `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` specifically mentioned. The importance of measuring flakiness by package rather than individual test was highlighted, as shared environments can influence results.
### Supervisor Mode Renaming
On [#16379](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16379), there was a comment pointing out a potential mix-up in the proposed renaming, specifically regarding "standard mode" being replaced with "indexing mode" and "managed mode" also being renamed to "indexing mode."
