# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Jul 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The primary focus for the day was the addition of a new feature: an RCT demo page within the Superchain Playground, involving significant updates across various application and utility packages.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Playground Enhancements
A new RCT demo page was introduced to the Superchain Playground application. This feature involved extensive modifications to the application's routing, providers, and numerous components related to Uniswap actions, token handling, and chain interactions. This enhancement aims to improve developer experience and demonstrate cross-chain interoperability within the Superchain. ([#919](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/919))

### Viem and Utility Package Updates
Supporting the Superchain Playground enhancements, significant changes were made to the `viem` and `utils-app` packages. These updates include new ABIs, address sets, and chain configurations, particularly for `interopAlpha` and `supersim` chains, facilitating the new demo page's functionality.

### Congestion-based builder transaction reordering
Discussion continued on issue [#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/306), which proposes writing a design document for congestion-based builder transaction reordering. The core idea involves tracking excess DA usage over time and applying an exponential cost/score penalty. A recent comment from `moonfury-ops` at 2025-07-29T20:33:56Z expressed interest in collaborating on this topic. This issue explores potential mechanisms for managing network congestion, which could be implemented outside the core protocol as a test for a future L1 congestion cost component.
