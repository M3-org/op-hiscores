# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Jun 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing cross-chain interoperability with new GasTank event indexing and ABI additions, alongside several package releases for `supersim` and other ecosystem components.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Interoperability Enhancements for GasTank
New features were added to index `GasTank` events and integrate its ABI, improving the tracking of gas provider operations and message claims. This includes new tables for `gasProviders` and `gasProviderPendingWithdrawals` and the addition of `interop-lib` as a submodule. ([#833](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/833), [#834](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/834))

### Package Versioning and Releases
Multiple packages, including `supersim`, `ponder-interop`, `viem`, and `wagmi`, received version updates and releases. These updates ensure the ecosystem components are up-to-date and reflect recent changes. ([#852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/852), [#853](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/853), [#855](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/855), [#856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/856))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Gas Tank Event Indexing
The issue concerning the indexing of `GasTank` events related to deposits, withdrawals, and claims has been closed. This was addressed by the new features implemented today. ([#838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/838))

### Tokenlist `dist` Directory Issue
The problem where versions after `10.0.238` of `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` lacked a `dist` directory, causing import errors, has been resolved. ([#1146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/1146))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Investigate and Improve CI Flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16271))
The discussion on CI flakiness continues, with recent comments from scharissis highlighting the release of a test flake report generator and its iteration, along with improved test flakiness. The team will continue to monitor and report on flakiness periodically. Earlier comments from scharissis also provided a list of the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests, noting that most flakiness is due to CircleCI machine, networking, or infrastructure issues rather than acceptance testing itself.

### Improve Reliability of Acceptance Tests ([#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16378))
The issue of improving acceptance test reliability saw a new comment from scharissis, who pointed to a new "Flakiness Report" ([#16411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16411)) which includes "Job Name" to help identify the source of flakiness. Earlier, nonsense noted that `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` and the `reorg` package pass with `-count=5`, and that the `op-acceptance-tests/tests/interop/sync/multisupervisor_interop` package appears flaky when all tests within it are run. pcw109550 also raised a point about measuring flakiness by package rather than by individual test, as tests sharing the same environment can interfere with each other.
