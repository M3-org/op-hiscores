## CLOSED ISSUES

### Test Reliability Improvements
The issue concerning the reliability of acceptance tests was closed today [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16378). The closure indicates that significant improvements have been made to the tests, with a commitment to continuous monitoring and further enhancements to prevent flakiness.

### Interop Logic Prioritization
The issue related to adding a mode for `op-node` to use pre-Interop logic in trivial-Interop cases was closed [#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16520). This indicates a shift in prioritization, with the feature no longer being actively pursued.

### Batcher Throttling Issue Resolution
The `op-batcher` `SetMaxDASize` issue was closed due to inactivity [#15355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/15355). The issue was related to an RPC error when setting the maximum DA size.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes
Discussion on [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/15789) continues, with stevennevins outlining a detailed checklist of tasks. These include moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, removing `anchorStateRegistry` from `StandardValidatorOverrides`, unskipping and updating tests in `DeployOPChain.t.sol`, reviewing comment responses, addressing TODO comments, rebasing updates from EVM safety refactoring, and fixing Go updates in the Go test/integration.

### RV Audit - `TestCrossSafeUpdate` and Hazard Set Construction
The discussion on [#16548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16548) saw a new comment from DeVikingMark, indicating a pull request has been made to address the concerns raised in the issue regarding the `TestCrossSafeUpdate` and the lack of clear `invalid` signals during Hazard Set construction.

### Abnormal CPU Usage with `op-geth`
On [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/613), PierrickGT provided a `pprof` profile, confirming the high CPU usage issue. The latest update suggests that the performance issue might be related to an index update process, which took approximately 24 hours to complete on their system. Previous comments from jsvisa and hekich also pointed to the possibility of index rebuilding as the cause for temporary high CPU usage.
