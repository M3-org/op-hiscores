## ACTIVE ISSUES
### CI Flakiness Investigation
Discussions continued on investigating and improving CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16271)). On June 12, `nonsense` linked a related issue in the `optimism` repository. Previous comments from June 9 by `scharissis` detailed the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests and noted that most flakiness was due to infrastructure issues rather than acceptance testing itself. A later comment on June 13 by `scharissis` linked a related issue and PR.
### Incorrect Nonce from `eth_getTransactionCount`
The issue regarding `eth_getTransactionCount` returning an incorrect nonce for pending transactions ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/623)) saw a new comment from `mukul3097` on June 12, asking for an update. This follows previous inquiries from `ntrzr` and `mukul3097` on June 9 and June 6, respectively, indicating an ongoing need for resolution.
