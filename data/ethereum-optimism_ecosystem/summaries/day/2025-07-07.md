## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superstacks Mini App Development & Deployment
Several issues related to the Superstacks Mini App were closed, indicating significant progress in its development and preparation for production. This includes scoping the WorldID Mini App ([#827](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/827)), configuring its production deployment ([#866](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/866)), implementing its UI for the claim flow ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/867)), and implementing the "program has ended" state ([#871](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/871)).

### Backend and Airdrop Integration
Backend modifications to support Superstacks Claim by removing delegation checks ([#849](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/849)) were completed. Additionally, an instance for the Airdrop 6 Event log poller was implemented to ensure the `isClaimed` value persists after a user claims ([#850](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/850)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node Interop Logic
Discussion on issue [#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16520) regarding adding a mode to `op-node` to use pre-Interop logic in trivial-Interop cases continued. A comment from `tynes` on July 7th at 16:34:20Z suggested considering a similar approach to `op-e2e` or `sysgo` where services run in the same process. The issue was subsequently closed on July 9th at 17:01:07Z by `tynes`, stating that it will no longer be prioritized.

### Flashblocks Gate Acceptance Testing
Issue [#16630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16630) was opened and closed on July 7th, concerning the `flashblocks gate` being aware of `flashblocks-websocket-proxy`. The issue highlights that the `flashblocks gate` currently only expects streaming from `rbuiders`, but now `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` also serves this stream, which needs validation by acceptance tests. `yashvardhan-kukreja` linked an associated PR ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16584](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16584)) on July 7th at 17:01:22Z.
