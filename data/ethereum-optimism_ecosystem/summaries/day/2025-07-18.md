# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Jul 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw progress in the `verbs` project with the addition of wallet querying functionality and the initiation of its migration to a standalone repository. Several interop acceptance test issues were also addressed and closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Verbs Wallet Querying
A new feature was added to the `verbs` SDK and service, enabling the querying of wallets. This involved adding `getAllWallets` to the SDK and a corresponding `GET /wallets` endpoint to the service, along with updates to the UI. ([#914](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/914))

### Verbs Repository Migration
Work has begun to move the `verbs` project into its own dedicated repository, aiming to make it a standalone project independent of the broader ecosystem context. This involves copying the `verbs` applications and setting up CI steps in the new repository. ([#918](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/918))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interop Acceptance Test Resolution
Several issues related to interop acceptance tests were closed. This includes handling a failing test due to an `op-geth` version bump ([#16731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16731)) and the general acceptance test for interop networks ([#298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/298)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Verbs Standalone Repository
A new issue was opened to track the migration of the `verbs` project to a solo repository, aiming to decouple it from the main ecosystem repository. This involves copying the `verbs` apps and setting up CI in the new repo, with a future step to remove them from the current repository. ([#918](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/918))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop Acceptance Test Topology
Discussion continued on matching the acceptance test topology to real-world production environments. The issue highlights that the current local Kurtosis interop devnet exposes the sequencer publicly, which deviates from production. This problem stems from an `op-geth` sequencer not setting the proper flag, causing test failures. The focus is on making the Kurtosisnet YAML description match production, including adding `proxyd` and verifier nodes. ([#16746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16746))
