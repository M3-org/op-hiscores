# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Jun 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in developer tooling with the `@eth-optimism/viem` package, specifically enhancing documentation generation for non-interop actions. Several new issues were opened, focusing on Superchain tools and interop demo applications, while a key documentation-related issue was closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Viem Documentation Generation
Documentation generation for the `@eth-optimism/viem` package has been significantly improved. The `pnpm run docs` command now correctly auto-generates documentation for non-interop actions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all functions and type aliases within the package. This addresses a long-standing issue and streamlines the developer experience for users of the Viem library. ([#859](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/859))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Viem Documentation Improvement
The issue concerning the lack of auto-generated documentation for standard actions within the `@eth-optimism/viem` package has been successfully resolved. Running `pnpm run docs` now correctly generates documentation for non-interop actions, improving the usability and completeness of the Viem library's documentation. ([#731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/731))

## NEW ISSUES

### Superchain Tools and Interop Demos
Two new issues were opened today, both related to enhancing the Superchain ecosystem. One issue proposes a "Superchain tools RCT Demo" ([#864](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/864)), while the other suggests integrating the "interop-alpha demo app as a page into superchain playground" ([#865](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/865)). These issues aim to improve the demonstration and accessibility of Superchain capabilities.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher Memory Optimization
Discussions on optimizing memory consumption in the `op-batcher` ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16537)) continued, with `geoknee` providing a detailed analysis using `pprof`. The analysis suggests that the compressor is the primary source of memory usage, especially during backlogs. `geoknee` proposed two optimizations: making the shadow compressor use half the memory by not using two compressors internally (with an incoming PR) and more eagerly discarding the compressor after channel submission. `sebastianst` suggested running a memory profiler to further investigate.

### op-node: Trivial-interop mode without supervisor
The discussion around running `op-node` in a trivial interop case without a supervisor ([#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16519)) saw `sebastianst` clarify that the goal is to prevent churn for chain operators who only have a trivial dep set, avoiding the requirement to run a supervisor in the coming months. This is seen as a temporary measure until a better `op-supervisor` and `op-node` implementation is available for interop merging. `Inphi` had previously questioned the necessity of this, fearing it might complicate future upgrades.

### Remove redundant assertions outside of the StandardValidator
The issue of removing redundant assertions in the contracts package ([#16362](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16362)) saw `AmadiMichael` outline a two-phase approach. First, remove checks already present in `ChainAssertions.sol` from other `Deploy*.s.sol` scripts. Second, move the checks from `ChainAssertions.sol` to the `StandardValidator`. If codesize limits are exceeded, some checks will be moved to a child contract deployed by the validator.
