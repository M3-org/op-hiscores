### CI Pipeline SLAs and Accountability Framework
Discussions continued on [#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16437) regarding the adoption of internal SLAs for the continuous integration pipeline. On June 16th, `scharissis` initiated the discussion by outlining the "Why" behind SLAs, emphasizing clear expectations, accountability, and objective metrics. They then proposed a detailed "CI Pipeline SLAs & Accountability Framework" covering availability, performance, and developer experience metrics, along with an accountability framework for bad test resolution and a responsibility matrix. Key proposed metrics included a 95% job success rate, 80% of PR pipelines completing within 1 hour, and PR merge time within 7 days.

### Configurable Dependency Set for Supersim
Discussion on [#361](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/361) revolved around making the dependency set configurable for L2 chains in supersim. On June 16th, `its-everdred` requested an example flag and its expected effect for configuring the dependency set. In response, `tremarkley` suggested a `--dependency-set <chains>` flag, where specified chains would be grouped into a dependency set. They also provided a link to the dependency set specification and a starting point in the monorepo for managing dependency sets.
