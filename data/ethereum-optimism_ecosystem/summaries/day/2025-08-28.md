## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Documentation for OP Stack Rollup Testnet Creation
Discussion continues on [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/1530) regarding creating an OP Stack Rollup testnet with `op-deployer`. The latest comment from krofax at 2025-08-28T15:56:40Z highlights a "rich PR" that overhauls the old documentation, inviting review. Earlier comments from Visheshgpt and Chomtana pointed out high RPC call numbers on Alchemy with the permissioned fault-proof system and confusion in existing documentation due to mixed deployment methods.

### CI for `op-geth` PRs
Issue [#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/665) discusses running the monorepo CI suite on `op-geth` PRs. The latest comment from ajsutton at 2025-08-28T20:01:03Z suggests a periodic job to check for the latest `op-geth` commit and notify on Slack if it fails, as an alternative to direct CI integration.
