# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Aug 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on addressing infrastructure and security concerns, with new issues opened for website font updates and CSP implementation. Discussions continued on `op-proposer` configuration, sync testing, and flashblocks-related alerts.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### op-up Challenger Support
The issue of supporting the challenger within `op-up` was closed, with the conclusion that distributing the challenger via `op-up` for `sysgo` is likely not worth the effort, and focusing on other backends like Docker is preferred ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17005)).

## NEW ISSUES
### Website Enhancements
Two new issues were opened to address website improvements: one to update the font for community.optimism.io ([#933](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/933)) and another to add Content Security Policy (CSP) to oplabs.co site ([#934](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/934)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-proposer Configuration
A user confirmed that setting `--game-type=1` resolved their `op-proposer` issue, which was failing to create a transaction due to a `NoImplementation` error related to misconfigured contracts or an incorrect game type ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/13502)).

### Sync Tester Development
Discussions on `op-sync-tester` and `op-acceptance-tests` continued, with a focus on testing every OP Stack Hard Fork transition, not just Isthmus. Ideas for future test cases include validating multiple CLs syncing together and checking L2CLs with user transactions in L2 blocks. The issue was reopened as not all HF transitions were tested ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16703)).

### Flashblocks Load Testing
An update indicated that a report summarizing the outcome of load tests on eris-0 for flashblocks is currently being worked on ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16756)).

### Flashblocks Alerting
Progress was noted on creating an alert for when a non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off, pending the landing of a related pull request ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16867)). Additionally, an existing peer count alert for `op-node` sequencer peering was identified, and the plan is to add Reth/op-rbuilder peer count for flashblocks-enabled sequencers ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16868)).
