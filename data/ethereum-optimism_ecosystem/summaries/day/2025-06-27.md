# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Jun 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in GasTank integration with new features for fetching and claiming relayed messages, alongside routine package versioning and dependency updates. A key issue related to GasTank claims was closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### GasTank Integration and Automation
Two new features were added to enhance GasTank functionality. An API endpoint was introduced to fetch pending GasTank claims, updating `gas_tank_relayed_message_receipts` to store message identifiers and log payloads ([#869](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/869)). Concurrently, the autorelayer was updated to automatically fetch and claim funds for all unclaimed relayed messages from the GasTank on each loop interval, including cleanup processes ([#870](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/870)).

### Package Versioning and Dependency Updates
Routine maintenance included versioning packages, which involved updates to `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json` files for `autorelayer-interop` and `ponder-interop` ([#878](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/878)). Additionally, the `supersim` package was bumped to version `0.1.0-alpha.56` ([#880](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/880)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened on Jun 27, 2025.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### GasTank Claim Automation
The issue tracking the setup of a job to claim funds from the GasTank after successful message relaying was closed ([#840](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/840)). This indicates the successful implementation of the related features.

### Supervisor Event Spikes Investigation
An investigation into spikes of `local-derived` and other events in `op-supervisor` was closed ([#16603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16603)). The latest comment speculates on a `ChainsDB` or `GlobalSyncExec` deadlock as a potential cause, awaiting a full panic stacktrace for confirmation.

## NEW ISSUES

### op-chain-ops Dependency Issue
A new bug was reported concerning a broken dependency in `op-chain-ops` related to `github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39` ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16612)). The issue highlights that `cosmos/go-bip39` is a fork but its latest version is `v1.0.0` compared to `v1.1.0` used by op, and notes that the `tyler-smith` repo is undergoing significant refactoring.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-supervisor, op-node: Improve reset unsafe target ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16314))
The latest comment from July 25, 2025, indicates the issue is being closed due to recent project changes, with a note to re-open or create a new issue if needed. A comment from July 21, 2025, suggests that most actionable items have been covered by related PRs and questions if further work is needed given upcoming component refactoring. A comment from June 27, 2025, notes partial implementation in a linked PR for supervisor responsibility in providing reset targets, but points out remaining challenges with pre- and post-Interop handling and the lack of a logs DB pre-Interop.

### op-supervisor: Improve L1 origin validity handling during resets ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16315))
The latest comment from June 27, 2025, states that a L1 origin verifier method now exists at the supervisor side, used for local unsafe head validity. It suggests extending this method to the safe head to ensure canonical L1 origin for reset targets. Earlier comments from June 9, 2025, and June 6, 2025, discuss the importance of the supervisor providing only valid targets and avoiding complex walkbacks, emphasizing that if a target is invalid, the supervisor should initiate another reset.

### Abnormal CPU usage with latest op-geth (v1.101511.0) ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/613))
The latest comment from July 9, 2025, confirms similar performance issues and provides instructions for pprof metrics. It also notes that the performance issue was likely due to an index update, which took about 24 hours to complete. Comments from June 28, 2025, provide detailed instructions on how to capture and analyze pprof data, and discuss whether the CPU usage is a temporary effect of index upgrades or a persistent bug. A comment from June 27, 2025, suggests that the high CPU usage is temporary due to log indexing rebuilds in the backported go-ethereum version.
