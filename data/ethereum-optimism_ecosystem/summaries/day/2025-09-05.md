# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Sep 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in addressing `min-base-fee` related issues and resolving a long-standing `op-nat` integration request. Discussions also continued on handling large genesis files and clarifying chain configurations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `min-base-fee` Implementation Completed
Several issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature were closed today, indicating progress in its implementation. This includes adding `minBaseFee` to the block header's `extraData` field ([#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/649)), incorporating an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3` ([#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/650)), and updating `eip1559.CalcBaseFee` to enforce the minimum if the feature is active ([#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/651)). All these closures reference the same `op-geth` pull request, suggesting a consolidated effort.

### `op-nat` Kurtosis Integration Deprioritized
The issue concerning running `op-nat` in Kurtosis ([#158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/158)) was closed. The decision was made to deprioritize this request due to a shift towards prioritizing other local development environment initiatives.

### Wallet Naming Convention Updated
A new issue regarding the renaming of "embedded wallets" to "hosted wallets" ([#964](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/964)) was opened and closed on the same day, indicating a quick resolution to this naming convention update.

### Wallet Naming Convention
A new issue was opened to rename "embedded wallets" to "hosted wallets" ([#964](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/964)). This issue was also closed on the same day.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Large Genesis File Initialization in `op-geth`
Discussion continued on the issue of `op-geth` initialization with a large genesis file leading to a LevelDB panic ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/668)). The latest comment from @protolambda suggests that the Genesis-State-Spec (the "alloc" part of `genesis.json`) is optional and doesn't need to be stored in `geth`. The recommendation is to modify `op-geth` for a one-time state import by not storing the alloc data as a flat JSON blob and to include the `stateHash` attribute of the genesis block into the chain-`config` part of `genesis.json`. This approach allows fresh nodes to start with an empty DB and snap-sync state from other bootstrap nodes, similar to how `op-mainnet` operates.

### Superchain Configuration Explicitness
The issue regarding making superchain configurations fully explicit ([#763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/763)) remains active. The latest comment from @alfonso-op questions whether chain configs are already self-descriptive and if the issue can be closed, indicating a need for clarification on the current state of configuration explicitness.
