## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superstacks Mini App Enhancements
Several issues related to the Superstacks Mini App were closed, including the integration of rank and XP into the claim endpoint [#847](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/847), cleanup of the claim UI [#848](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/848), and setting up a bugbash for the Superstacks claim on the website [#851](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/851).

### Documentation and Analytics Improvements
An issue concerning Google Analytics tracking for blog posts on optimism.io was closed [#800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/800). Additionally, a suggestion regarding bridging ERC-20 tokens with Viem in the documentation was closed [#1508](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/1508), with a note that the issue was addressed in a previous PR.

### CI/CD and Testing Improvements
An issue related to investigating and improving CI flakiness was closed [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16271), with a summary of improvements made. A spike exploring CI SLAs was also closed [#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16437), with the decision not to implement CI SLAs for now. A feature request to enable deterministic gas testing by setting a fixed base fee was closed [#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/408), as the proposed solution was deemed unnecessary.

### Acceptance Test Porting
An issue to port `TestWithdrawalsRoot` to devstack was closed [#412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/412), with a reference to the implementing PR.

## NEW ISSUES

### Superstacks Mini App Development
Three new issues were opened related to the Superstacks Mini App: configuring production deployment [#866](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/866), implementing the Mini App UI for the claim flow [#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/867), and implementing the claim contract deployment process [#868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/868).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI Flakiness Investigation and Improvement [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16271)
The issue was closed today, with `scharissis` providing a final update on the progress made. Key achievements include the release and iteration of a test flake report generator, publicizing the report, and improving test flakiness. The team will continue to monitor flakiness. Earlier comments highlighted the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests and noted that most flakiness was due to infrastructure issues rather than acceptance testing itself.

### `op-node` Goroutine Stuck Issues [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16332)
Recent comments from `rrrengineer` and `Creamers158` confirm that they are experiencing similar issues with `op-node` v1.13.3, where the node gets stuck with thousands of goroutines, primarily in `select`, `IO wait`, or `yamux` session handlers, leading to sync failures. This indicates a persistent problem with `op-node` stability.

### Spike: CI SLAs [#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16437)
The issue was closed today, with `scharissis` deciding not to implement CI SLAs for now. The discussion involved valuable feedback from `pauldowman`, `teddyknox`, and `ajsutton`. Key points raised included concerns about the proposed 5% failure rate being too high, the 1-hour PR feedback time being too long, and the danger of disabling tests. There was a consensus that PR merge time is not a meaningful CI metric. `teddyknox` suggested getting smarter about allowing new tests into the repo to proactively detect flakiness. `ajsutton` expressed skepticism about the necessity of SLAs for developers but acknowledged their potential utility for platforms.
