# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Sep 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on removing the `verbs` packages from the repository, indicating a shift in project structure. Several issues related to marketing site migration and font updates were closed, while new issues were opened to track the React migration and related UI/UX enhancements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Project Restructuring: Verbs Package Removal
*   The `verbs` service, UI, and SDK packages were removed from the repository, as they have been moved to a separate dedicated repository. This streamlines the `ecosystem` repository by externalizing specific functionalities. ([#946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/946))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Marketing Site Font Updates
*   Multiple issues related to updating fonts on various Optimism applications and documentation sites, including `app.optimism.io`, `docs.optimism.io`, `console.optimism.io`, and `community.optimism.io`, were closed. This indicates a consistent brand font update across the Optimism ecosystem. ([#922](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/922), [#923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/923), [#924](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/924), [#933](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/933))

### Design System and Security Enhancements
*   The implementation of a Storybook and design system for `optimism.io` was completed, suggesting progress in establishing consistent UI/UX guidelines. ([#931](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/931))
*   A Content Security Policy (CSP) was added to `oplabs.co`, enhancing the security posture of the site. ([#934](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/934))
*   An update to `localchain.dev` was completed, including the addition of "atlas" and making the logo clickable. ([#932](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/932))

## NEW ISSUES

### Optimism Marketing Site React Migration
*   A tracking issue has been opened for the migration of the Optimism marketing site to a modern stack using Next.js 15 + TypeScript. ([#937](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/937))
*   Related setup tasks include establishing a monorepo with shared configurations ([#938](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/938)), bootstrapping the Next.js app with Netlify CI/CD ([#939](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/939)), initializing Sanity studio with starter schemas ([#940](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/940)), and configuring Storybook with Tailwind support ([#941](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/941)).

### UI/UX and Site Enhancements
*   Plans are in place to create a shared UI package for reusable components like buttons and typography. ([#942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/942))
*   Core site elements such as navigation, footer, hero, and card grid components are slated for implementation. ([#943](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/943))
*   The introduction of Framer Motion basics for shared animation patterns is also planned. ([#944](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/944))
*   A spike has been initiated to explore `status.optimism.io`. ([#945](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/945))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona + Cannon: OPCM Support ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17285))
*   The discussion revolves around verifying necessary changes in OPCM to support Kona + Cannon, specifically ensuring it doesn't assume Cannon as the only game type.
*   A comment from ajsutton clarifies that OPCM needs to support deploying the new game type, and a specific `if` block in `OPContractsManager.sol` will likely require updates.
*   pauldowman suggests confirming if any action is truly needed before closing the issue.

### Kona + Cannon: op-dispute-mon Support ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17286))
*   The issue addresses the need for `op-dispute-mon` to support Kona + Cannon game types, as it currently explicitly checks for certain game types.
*   ajsutton questions the initial phrasing "only look at specific game types," emphasizing that `dispute-mon` *must* return an error for unsupported game types and that new game types require explicit support.
*   pauldowman updated the issue description to "Update to support cannon-kona games," reflecting the need for direct support for the new game types.
