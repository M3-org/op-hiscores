## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Op-node Sync Mechanism Improvements
Discussions continued on deprecating the req-resp p2p sync in `op-node` to address existing sync problems. A detailed comment from @tessr provided additional context and ideas from @emilianobonassi, who prototyped an alternative unsafe block sync mechanism. This alternative is highlighted as cheaper, simpler, and faster for scaling out and recovery compared to the current req-resp method, which suffers from slow sync speeds and race conditions. The proposed alternative is complementary to p2p and involves a centralized driver for gossiping blocks, where the sequencer leader publishes the latest unsafe block via Redis, and other nodes subscribe and inject it via the `admin_postUnsafePayload` API.
