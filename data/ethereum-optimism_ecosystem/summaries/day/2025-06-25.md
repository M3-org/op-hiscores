# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Jun 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw updates to the GasTank ABI for Viem, a new release for Supersim, and several issues closed related to flashblocks, CI SLAs, and predeploy modifications. New issues were opened concerning Superstacks program states and batcher memory consumption.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Viem and Interoperability Updates
The `GasTank` ABI in Viem was updated to its latest version, aligning with changes in `interop-lib`. This update also involved adjusting the Ponder schema for `GasTank` to reflect naming changes, enhancing compatibility within the Superchain ecosystem.
- [#863](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/863)

### Supersim Release and Enhancements
A new release, `0.1.0-alpha.54`, was pushed for Supersim. Discussions around Supersim also clarified its role as a lightweight local development tool for testing multi-chain/interop applications, distinct from Kurtosis devnets. A feature request was also made to enable logging of user-specified contracts within Supersim.

- [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/399)
- [#411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/411)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened on Jun 25, 2025.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks and Transaction Acceptance
Several issues related to Flashblocks were closed, indicating progress in enabling and testing this feature. This includes enabling flashblocks on `eris-0` for confidence in `op-sepolia` and completing acceptance tests for flashblocks transactions.
- [#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16468)
- [#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/354)

### CI/CD and Predeploy Improvements
An issue exploring CI SLAs was closed with the decision not to implement them for now, following extensive feedback. Additionally, an issue concerning the modification of predeploys was closed, as Supersim now supports modifying the `L2toL2CDM` predeploy.
- [#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16437)
- [#393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/393)

### Documentation and Script Improvements
A broken link in the documentation for `L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol` was resolved and closed. An issue regarding OPCM Migrate Script Improvements was also closed, with updates to the runbook to sanity check inputs.

- [#16326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16326)

## NEW ISSUES

### Superstacks Program State and Claim Flow
Two new issues were opened related to the Superstacks program. One focuses on implementing a "program has ended" state, and the other addresses bug bash issues identified in the Superstacks Claim Flow.
- [#871](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/871)
- [#872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/872)

### Op-Batcher Memory Optimization and Observability
Two new issues were created to address memory consumption in the `op-batcher`. One is a spike to optimize memory usage, particularly during L1 congestion, while the other aims to increase observability of memory consumption through `pprof` integration in Kurtosis devnet and CI tests.
- [#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16537)
- [#16572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16572)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Netchef and Flashblock Websocket Configuration ([#15940](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/15940))
The latest comment from yashvardhan-kukreja on June 25, 2025, indicates associated PRs: `infrastructure-services/pull/471` and `infrastructure-services/pull/474`. This suggests ongoing work to improve Netchef to automatically bootstrap `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` with appropriate configurations for HA conductors.

### Spike: CI SLAs ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16437))
Discussions on June 25, 2025, from scharissis confirm the decision not to implement CI SLAs for now, closing the issue. Earlier comments from pauldowman and teddyknox on June 24, 2025, emphasized focusing on rapidly fixing flaky tests or being smarter about allowing new tests into the repo, rather than formal SLAs. ajsutton also provided detailed feedback on the proposed metrics, questioning their relevance and suggesting alternatives for addressing flaky tests.

### Spike: op-batcher optimize memory consumption ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16537))
Latest comments from geoknee on June 25, 2025, detail findings from `pprof` suggesting that the compressor is the primary source of memory usage when a backlog of channels occurs in the batcher. Two optimization ideas are proposed: making the shadow compressor use half the memory and not retaining the compressor after a channel is submitted. A detailed recipe for running `pprof` locally was also provided.

### op-batcher: increase observability of memory consumption ([#16572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16572))
The latest comment from tynes on June 25, 2025, notes that @trianglesphere has also raised performance issues potentially related to memory pressure. geoknee's comments on June 25, 2025, show local benchmark results indicating significant memory consumption (190MB per operation) for channels with many transactions. The discussion highlights the need to ensure existing channel compressor benchmarks run locally, on CI, and are up-to-date with Brotli compression.

### withdrawal pathways for superchain output roots ([#821](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/821))
The latest comment from fainashalts on June 25, 2025, asks if the upcoming devnet is the one to test with, given the renaming of devnets, and if testing against an endpoint is already possible. This indicates ongoing efforts to update withdrawal code in Viem to support the Superchain's new output roots structure after the interop hard fork.
