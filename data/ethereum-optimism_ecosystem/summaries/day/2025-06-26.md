# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Jun 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing interop functionality with new GasTank integrations and autorelayer improvements. Significant progress was also made in streamlining Superchain-Ops tooling, with multiple issues related to task simulation, testing, and architecture being closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Interoperability Enhancements for GasTank
New features were added to improve the interaction with the GasTank, including an endpoint for fetching pending messages and an update to the autorelayer to only process messages with sufficient GasTank funds. This ensures more efficient and secure message relaying within the Superchain.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interoperability and Gas Tank Integration
The issue of updating the relayer to only relay messages for which the gas tank has funds has been closed. This directly supports the new features added to the autorelayer and ponder-interop for more efficient and secure message relaying.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Abnormal CPU usage with latest op-geth (v1.101511.0)
Discussion continues on the abnormal CPU usage observed with `op-geth v1.101511.0`. A user provided a `pprof` file and noted that the performance issue might be due to an index update, which took about 24 hours to complete on their system. Another user shared commands to capture `pprof` data for further analysis. The issue seems to be related to the log indexing rebuild introduced in this version, which is expected to cause temporary high CPU usage until completed.
- [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/613)

### Use GoReleaser for op-node/batcher/proposer/challenger release pipeline
The discussion on using GoReleaser for the release pipeline continues, with a recent comment suggesting that if release notes or changelogs are generated, they should be committed to the codebase (either monorepo or `op-workbench`) to enable a "one-click solution" for consistent and accurate changelogs. This builds on previous discussions about streamlining the release process and unifying build systems.
- [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16097)

### [op-acceptance-tests] Move all AT's into the one workflow
A new comment linked several related pull requests in `infra` and `optimism` repositories, indicating ongoing work to consolidate acceptance tests into a single workflow. This is part of a broader effort to centralize and streamline testing procedures.
- [#16272](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16272)

### Refactor signFromChildMultisig to reduce noisy terminal output
New comments from community members express interest in working on this issue, aiming to reduce the verbosity of the `signFromChildMultisig` function's terminal output. One user identified the `print` function call within `simulateRun` as the primary source of noise and proposed removing or commenting it out to focus on critical signing information.
- [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/781)

### what's the difference between supersim and interop kurtosis devnet?
A user clarified that `supersim` is mainly for testing dapps and multichain/interop applications, serving as a lighter-weight wrapper around Anvil with pre-deployed OP Stack and support for upcoming interop features. This distinguishes it from Kurtosis, which is used for testing the chains themselves.
