# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Nov 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating Viem chain definitions to resolve a critical Superchain relayer issue for Lisk, ensuring interoperability. Package versions were also updated across several applications.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Interoperability and Chain Definition Updates
Critical updates were made to Viem chain definitions, bringing them in sync with the latest Superchain Registry state. This resolved an issue where the Superchain relayer was failing to relay messages for Lisk due to outdated definitions, enhancing cross-chain interoperability within the Superchain.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher: Sync with op-node rollup config
Discussion on [#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18178) centers on the `op-batcher`'s current behavior of fetching the rollup config only once at startup, leading to potential brittleness if the config changes. The latest comments suggest that relying on error handling for outdated configs could be brittle. An alternative proposed is to integrate with the active endpoint provider to signal changes, triggering a rollup config reload. Another suggestion is to make the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher to clarify dependencies and avoid unnecessary concurrency.

### op-chain-ops: broken dependency github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39
Issue [#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16612) regarding a broken dependency in `op-chain-ops` has been fixed. The problem stemmed from `op` using `v1.1.0` of `github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39`, while `github.com/cosmos/go-bip39`, a fork, was at `v1.0.0`. The fix was implemented in a separate pull request.
