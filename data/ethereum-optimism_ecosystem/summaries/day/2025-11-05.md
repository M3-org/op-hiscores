# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Nov 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the ecosystem repo focused on updating `viem` chain definitions to resolve a critical Superchain relayer issue for Lisk, ensuring interoperability. There was also a routine package versioning update.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Interoperability & `viem` Chain Definitions
A significant update was made to synchronize `viem` chain definitions with the latest `superchain-registry` state. This resolved an issue where the Superchain relayer was failing to relay messages for Lisk due to outdated chain information, directly addressing a critical interoperability concern. This update involved extensive changes across various `viem` documentation files and several `apps/superchain-playground` components. ([#966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/966))

### Package Versioning
Routine package versioning was performed across several applications and packages, including `autorelayer-interop`, `ponder-interop`, `sponsored-sender`, `superchain-playground`, `viem`, and `wagmi`. This ensures that all components are up-to-date and ready for potential releases. ([#969](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/969))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Relayer Fix for Lisk
The issue regarding the Superchain relayer being broken for Lisk was successfully closed today. The problem stemmed from an outdated chain definition for Lisk, which prevented message relaying. This was addressed by updating all chain definitions to be in sync with the `superchain-registry`. ([#967](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/967))

## NEW ISSUES

### `viem` Documentation Generation Issue
A new issue was opened concerning the `autogen docs` script in `eth-optimism/viem`. The script is reportedly not printing nested objects correctly, impacting the accuracy and completeness of the generated documentation. ([#968](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/968))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-batcher`: Stay in Sync with `op-node` Rollup Config ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18178))
The discussion revolves around the `op-batcher`'s current behavior of fetching the rollup config only once at startup from the `op-node` via RPC, and never updating it thereafter. This is identified as a brittle approach.

**Key points from recent comments:**
- **Sebastianst** suggests that it could be brittle to identify all error points indicative of an outdated rollup config and implement error handling like restarts. An alternative proposed is to hook into the active endpoint provider to signal when the active endpoint changes, triggering a rollup config reload.
- **Joshklop** agrees on the brittleness and expresses concern that making the endpoint provider control the batcher could introduce unnecessary concurrency. He proposes making the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher to clarify dependencies.
- **Sebastianst** likes the idea of the operator providing the rollup config as a simple, pragmatic solution for consistency. He notes that for chains in the embedded `superchain-registry`, the batcher could query the chain ID at startup and load the config, only requiring explicit provision for non-SR chains. A downside noted is that this would necessitate a new batcher release for every `superchain-registry` config change, which is not currently the case.
