Discussions also continued on supporting embedded custom prestates for Kona and adapting the `print_staging_report` script for dispute-game v2 compatibility. A low-priority issue regarding `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` support for `sysext` was closed due to Kurtosis deprecation.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Reports**: Discussions on [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/1148) continued regarding updating the `print_staging_report` script for dispute-game v2 compatibility. The latest comments clarify that the script primarily reads from the permissioned game and that changes to the output format might cause disruption. It was also noted that the script currently assumes only a Permissioned and Permissionless game, which will need to be adapted for two permissionless games.
