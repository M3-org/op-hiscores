## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Infrastructure and Testing Updates
Discussions on [#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16704) indicate that Kurtosis, used for `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack`, is being deprecated. This suggests a shift in the testing and deployment infrastructure.

### Kona Prestate Support
Issue [#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18271) is tracking the addition of support for embedded custom prestates to Kona. A fix for this is currently under review, as noted in the latest comment.

### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Reporting
Issue [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/1148) focuses on updating the `print_staging_report` script to be compatible with dispute-game v2. The latest comments highlight the need to adapt the script to read `gameArgs` from the DGF and address potential changes in the JSON output due to the introduction of two permissionless games, which could cause disruption.
