# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Jul 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in supporting sponsored messages with new API capabilities and relayer support. Initial setup for a "verbs" proof-of-concept SDK was also completed, alongside routine package versioning. Several issues were closed, including one related to `op-batcher` code duplication and another concerning `TestChainFork` porting.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Sponsored Message Handling
API support for fetching sponsored messages has been added, extending the `/messages/pending` endpoint to filter by `filteredTargets` ([#899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/899)). Concurrently, the autorelayer now supports relaying these sponsored messages by accepting a list of sponsored targets in its configuration ([#900](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/900)).

### "Verbs" POC Setup
An initial proof-of-concept (POC) SDK for "verbs" integrations has been set up, including an empty function to confirm successful setup. This lays the groundwork for future money verb integrations on the OP Stack ([#901](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/901)).

### Package Versioning
Routine package versioning updates were performed for `ponder-interop` ([#903](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/903)) and `autorelayer-interop` ([#904](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/904)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Code Duplication Resolution
The issue concerning duplicate code in `op-batcher`'s `checkTxpool` function was closed, indicating that the redundancy has been addressed or deemed unnecessary ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16677)).

### Acceptance Test Porting
The task to port `TestChainFork` to devstack within the acceptance tests has been completed and closed ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/413)).

### Builder Deployment and Namespacing Spikes
Discussions and spikes related to the necessity of NVMe node deployment for `op-rbuilders` and dedicated namespacing for rbuilders were concluded. It was decided to skip NVMe nodes for now and to stick with including flashblocks components in the same namespace as other sequencer components, addressing monitoring and alerting gaps with additional labels ([#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16689), [#16690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16690)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Verbs Integration
New issues have been opened to establish the "verbs" package and application within the ecosystem ([#905](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/905)) and to integrate a wallet solution, specifically Privy, into the "verbs" framework ([#906](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/906)).

### Dependency Vulnerabilities
A new issue was created to address and resolve identified dependency vulnerabilities within the project ([#907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/907)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `txpool`: Invalid Interop Tx Conditionally Included ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/635))
Discussion continues on the intermittent issue where invalid interop execution messages are conditionally included in the transaction pool. @pcw109550 provided detailed reproduction steps and artifacts from CI logs, showing instances where invalid transactions were inserted into the mempool, with some getting evicted and others stuck. @axelKingsley has been unable to reproduce the bug despite extensive testing and analysis of `geth`'s transaction submission flow, noting that all transactions should pass through ingress filters.

### Enable Flashblocks on Sunnyside Sequencers ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16688))
The issue of enabling flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers is ongoing. @yashvardhan-kukreja commented that this task has been deprioritized in favor of first achieving stable flashblocks operation on OP Labs Sepolia infrastructure, and that issue [#16685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16685) is a blocker.
