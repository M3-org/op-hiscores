# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September's development was characterized by a significant strategic initiative to modernize the Optimism marketing site, with numerous issues opened to track the migration to a new tech stack featuring Next.js and Sanity. This effort was complemented by repository streamlining, as the `verbs` packages were moved to a dedicated repository. Concurrently, discussions continued around ensuring core components like `op-dispute-mon` are prepared for the upcoming Kona + Cannon upgrade, and several UI/UX consistency tasks were completed across the ecosystem's web properties.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on restructuring the repository to improve focus and maintainability.

- **Repository Restructuring:** The `verbs` service, UI, and SDK packages were removed from the main ecosystem repository. This change streamlines the project by externalizing these specific functionalities into their own dedicated repository, simplifying the core codebase ([#946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/946)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
Several issues were resolved, primarily focused on enhancing user experience, brand consistency, and security across various web properties.
- **Branding and UI Consistency:** A series of updates were completed to standardize the font across `app.optimism.io`, `docs.optimism.io`, `console.optimism.io`, and `community.optimism.io`, ensuring a consistent brand identity ([#922](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/922), [#923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/923), [#924](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/924), [#933](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/933)). The implementation of a Storybook and design system for `optimism.io` was also finalized ([#931](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/931)).
- **Security and Site Enhancements:** A Content Security Policy (CSP) was added to `oplabs.co` to improve its security posture ([#934](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/934)).

### New & Active Issues
A major new initiative was kicked off, and important discussions continued regarding protocol upgrades.
- **Marketing Site Modernization:** A significant effort began to migrate the Optimism marketing site to a modern stack using Next.js 15 and TypeScript. A master tracking issue ([#937](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/937)) was created, along with sub-tasks for key milestones:
    - Setting up a monorepo with shared configurations ([#938](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/938)).
    - Bootstrapping the Next.js app with Netlify CI/CD ([#939](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/939)).
    - Initializing a Sanity studio for content management ([#940](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/940)).
    - Creating a shared UI package and implementing core components like navigation and footers ([#942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/942), [#943](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/943)).
- **Kona + Cannon Upgrade Support:** Active discussions are ongoing to ensure core components are ready for the Kona + Cannon upgrade. Key issues include verifying that `OPCM` can support the new game type ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17285)) and updating `op-dispute-mon` to explicitly support and monitor cannon-kona games, as it must return an error for unsupported types ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/17286)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active technical discussions surrounding future protocol upgrades. Team members `ajsutton` and `pauldowman` engaged in detailed conversations on issues related to Kona + Cannon support. Their dialogue highlights a focus on ensuring that critical monitoring and contract management tools are robust and explicitly prepared for new game types, reflecting a proactive and detail-oriented approach to system upgrades.
