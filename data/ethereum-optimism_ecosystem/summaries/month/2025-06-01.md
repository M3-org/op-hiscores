# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
June was a month of focused execution on Superchain interoperability and developer experience, balanced with critical investigations into system stability. Significant progress was made on the GasTank mechanism, with new features for event indexing, message relaying, and automated fund claiming to bolster cross-chain operations. Developer tooling saw major enhancements, including improved documentation for `@eth-optimism/viem` and numerous refinements to Superchain-Ops. Concurrently, the team initiated deep dives into performance bottlenecks, with active discussions and profiling efforts targeting memory consumption in `op-batcher`, goroutine leaks in `op-node`, and event overflows in `op-supervisor`, setting the stage for future reliability improvements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on enhancing cross-chain functionality and improving the developer toolkit.

- **Superchain Interoperability via GasTank:** A significant effort was dedicated to building out the GasTank infrastructure. Development included indexing `GasTank` events and integrating its ABI to track provider operations ([#833](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/833), [#834](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/834), [#863](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/863)). The `autorelayer` was enhanced to only process messages with sufficient GasTank funds ([#861](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/861)) and to automatically claim funds for relayed messages ([#870](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/870)). An API endpoint was also added to fetch pending messages and claims ([#860](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/860), [#869](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/869)).

- **Developer Tooling & Experience:**
    - **`@eth-optimism/viem` Documentation:** A long-standing issue was resolved by significantly improving documentation generation for the Viem package, ensuring that non-interop actions are now correctly auto-documented ([#859](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/859)).
    - **`supersim` Releases:** The `supersim` package for local multi-chain development received several alpha releases throughout the month, advancing its capabilities ([#835](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/835), [#873](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/873), [#880](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/880)).
    - **Superchain-Ops Refinements:** A large batch of improvements were merged for the Superchain-Ops tooling, streamlining operational tasks by addressing issues related to task simulation, nonce handling, and address registry integration ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/337), [#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/342), [#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/448), and others).

- **Package Maintenance:** Routine version updates were applied across the ecosystem, including for `ponder-interop`, `viem`, `wagmi`, and `autorelayer-interop` to keep dependencies current ([#852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/852), [#853](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/853), [#878](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/878)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month reflected a dual focus on shipping new features and addressing foundational stability.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **CI/CD & Testing:** A major investigation into CI flakiness was concluded after implementing a test flake report generator and other improvements ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16271)). Following extensive discussion, a spike to define CI SLAs was closed with the decision not to implement them at this time ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16437)).
    - **Feature Completion:** Issues corresponding to the month's development work were closed, including GasTank claim automation ([#840](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/840)), relayer fund checks ([#839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/839)), and several tasks for the Superstacks Mini App claim flow ([#847](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/847), [#848](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/848), [#851](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/851)).
    - **Tooling & Bugs:** The `@eth-optimism/viem` documentation gap was closed ([#731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/731]), and a build issue with `@eth-optimism/tokenlist` was resolved ([#1146](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/1146)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Performance & Stability:** This was a dominant theme in active discussions. Investigations are ongoing for a critical `op-node` goroutine leak causing sync failures ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16332]), an `op-supervisor` event overflow crash loop ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16335)), and abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` potentially related to log indexing ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/613)). A new spike was created to profile and optimize significant memory consumption in the `op-batcher` during L1 congestion ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16537)).
    - **Superchain Architecture:** A notable discussion emerged around creating a "trivial-interop mode" for `op-node` that would not require a supervisor, aiming to reduce operational overhead for chain operators with simple dependency sets ([#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16519)).
    - **New Feature Planning:** A cluster of new issues was opened to scope out the next phase of work, including the Gas Tank contract implementation ([#836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/836)), enhancements to logging and alerting ([#841](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/841), [#844](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/844)), and the Superstacks claim flow UI and contract deployment ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/867), [#868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/868)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
June showcased a healthy mix of internal execution and external community engagement.

- **Deep Technical Discussions:** Core contributors engaged in detailed, multi-day discussions on complex topics. The debate around CI SLAs ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16437)) involved multiple team members weighing the pros and cons of formal metrics. Similarly, the `op-batcher` memory investigation ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16537)) saw contributors sharing `pprof` analysis and collaborating on optimization strategies.

- **Community-Driven Diagnostics:** Several issues saw valuable input from the wider community. In the `op-geth` high CPU usage thread ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/613)), multiple users confirmed the issue, shared their system specs, and provided `pprof` data to help diagnose the problem. This collaborative debugging is crucial for identifying and resolving real-world performance issues.

- **New Contributor Interest:** The issue to reduce noisy terminal output from a script ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/781)) attracted interest from several new community members, who offered to take on the task, signaling a welcoming environment for new contributors.
