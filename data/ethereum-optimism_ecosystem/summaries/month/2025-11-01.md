# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Work in November focused on strengthening the Superchain's interoperability and reliability. A critical issue affecting the Superchain relayer for Lisk was resolved by synchronizing `viem` chain definitions with the `superchain-registry`, restoring cross-chain messaging functionality. Alongside this immediate fix, discussions continued on improving the robustness of core components like the `op-batcher`, with a focus on how it handles dynamic rollup configurations to prevent brittleness in the long term.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Development efforts centered on ensuring the stability and consistency of the Superchain ecosystem.

- **Superchain Interoperability Fix:** A significant update was merged to synchronize `viem` chain definitions with the `superchain-registry`. This directly addressed a failure in the Superchain relayer for Lisk, which was caused by outdated chain information. The fix involved updates across `viem` documentation and `superchain-playground` components, ensuring reliable message relaying ([#966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/966)).

- **Dependency Management:** Routine package versioning was completed across multiple applications and packages, including `autorelayer-interop`, `ponder-interop`, `sponsored-sender`, `superchain-playground`, `viem`, and `wagmi`. This maintenance ensures all parts of the ecosystem are aligned and using up-to-date dependencies ([#969](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/969)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this period involved resolving a critical bug, identifying a new documentation flaw, and continuing a key architectural discussion.

- **Closed Issues:** The primary issue resolved was the broken Superchain relayer for Lisk. The root cause was identified as an outdated chain definition, and the issue was closed upon the successful merge of the corrective pull request ([#967](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/967)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - A new issue was opened regarding a bug in the `viem` documentation generation script, which fails to correctly render nested objects. This impacts the accuracy of generated documentation ([#968](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/968)).
    - An important discussion is ongoing regarding the `op-batcher`'s method for fetching its rollup configuration from `op-node` ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18178)). The current approach of fetching the config only once at startup is considered brittle. The debate centers on the best way to keep the config updated, weighing trade-offs between automatic reloads triggered by endpoint changes versus having the operator explicitly provide the configuration to the batcher for greater clarity and stability.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active discussion around the `op-batcher`'s design. Contributors `Sebastianst` and `Joshklop` engaged in a detailed technical debate, exploring different architectural solutions to improve the component's robustness. This conversation highlights a proactive approach to identifying and addressing potential points of failure in the system's core infrastructure.
