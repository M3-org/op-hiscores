# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of significant progress in enhancing cross-chain functionality and developer tooling within the Optimism ecosystem. Development was heavily focused on the interop stack, with major updates to `autorelayer-interop` and `ponder-interop` to improve gas provider balance calculations and support sponsored messages. A key highlight was the rapid initiation and development of the "Verbs" project, a new SDK and service for integrating money verbs, which progressed from a proof-of-concept to having its own UI and wallet integration. Concurrently, work on the Superstacks Mini App and Superchain Playground culminated in closed issues and a new RCT demo page, while a concerted effort was made to improve infrastructure stability and test reliability by resolving numerous outstanding issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on building out the tooling for a more robust and feature-rich Superchain.

- **Interop Relayer & API Enhancements:** A series of updates were made to the `autorelayer-interop` and `ponder-interop` applications to create a more accurate and reliable message relaying system.
    - **Improved Gas Accounting:** To provide a more accurate view of a gas provider's available balance, the system was updated to account for pending withdrawals ([#879](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/879), [#883](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/883)) and pending, unclaimed relays ([#886](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/886), [#887](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/887)).
    - **Sponsored Message Support:** The API was extended to filter for sponsored messages, and the autorelayer was updated to relay them, enabling new use cases for sponsored transactions ([#899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/899), [#900](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/900)).
    - **Bug Fixes & Alignments:** A critical bug was fixed where `BigInt` values were incorrectly serialized as numbers in the Ponder API ([#902](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/902)). The relayer was also updated to align with a new `GasTank` ABI, ensuring the `GasProvider` is specified at the time of relay ([#889](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/889), [#890](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/890), [#891](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/891)).

- **"Verbs" Project Initiation:** A new "Verbs" project was rapidly developed to simplify money verb integrations on the OP Stack.
    - **Foundation and Wallet Integration:** The project was bootstrapped with an initial SDK proof-of-concept ([#901](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/901)) and quickly expanded to include comprehensive wallet integration using Privy as the first adapter ([#908](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/908)).
    - **UI and API Features:** A `verbs-ui` application was created to provide a visual interface for the service ([#911](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/911]), and an endpoint was added to query all created wallets ([#914](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/914)).
    - **Repository Migration:** Work began to move the `verbs` project into its own standalone repository to decouple it from the main ecosystem monorepo ([#918](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/918)).

- **Superchain Playground Enhancements:** To improve developer experience and demonstrate cross-chain capabilities, a new RCT demo page was added to the Superchain Playground. This feature required extensive updates to the application's components, routing, and supporting utility packages, including new ABIs and chain configurations ([#919](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/919)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The month saw a strong focus on resolving existing issues, improving test reliability, and scoping future work.

- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were closed, reflecting progress across several key areas:
    - **Superstacks Mini App:** A cluster of issues related to the Superstacks Mini App were resolved, marking the completion of its UI implementation ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/867]), production deployment configuration ([#866](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/866)), and backend modifications ([#849](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/849)).
    - **Infrastructure Stability & Housekeeping:** Several long-standing issues concerning sequencer stability, such as halting on temporary errors ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/12240)) and recovery from sequence window expiration ([#11228](https://github.comcom/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/11228)), were closed. Redundant code in `op-batcher` was also addressed ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16677)).
    - **Acceptance Tests:** Progress was made in improving the test suite, with the closure of tasks related to porting `TestChainFork` ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/413)) and `TestERC20Bridge` ([#415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/415)) to devstack, and resolving interop test failures ([#298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/298), [#16731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16731)).
    - **"Verbs" Project:** Foundational issues for the new "Verbs" project, including package setup ([#905](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/905]), wallet integration ([#906](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/906]), and repository migration ([#918](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/918)), were successfully closed.

- **New & Active Issues:** Discussions this month highlighted key areas for future development and investigation.
    - **Future Work:** New issues were opened to track the migration from Etherscan to Blockscout ([#917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/917)) and to expand the "Verbs" project with a "lend" verb ([#915](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/915)).
    - **Ongoing Investigations:** Active discussions continued on several critical topics, including diagnosing abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/613)), reproducing an intermittent bug where invalid interop transactions are included in the txpool ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/635)), and designing an E2E test for transaction reinjection during reorgs ([#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16656)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. The investigation into the invalid interop transaction bug ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/635)) saw `pcw109550` providing detailed reproduction steps and artifacts, with `axelKingsley` conducting extensive testing in response. Similarly, the design of the `op-sync-tester` ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/16452)) involved a productive debate between `protolambda` and `pcw109550` on the best approach for session management. The rapid progress on the "Verbs" project suggests a highly focused and efficient effort, while the systematic closure of older issues by maintainers demonstrates a strong commitment to repository health and prioritization.
