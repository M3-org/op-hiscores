# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Development in December focused on foundational infrastructure and future-proofing the ecosystem. A key strategic decision was made to support ZK game challenging directly within the `op-challenger`, setting a direction for future protocol capabilities. Concurrently, significant effort was directed towards improving developer operations by unifying CI workflows. Active discussions also continued around core infrastructure, including porting the `SuperchainConfig` type and troubleshooting node synchronization issues reported by operators.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on refining the project's continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

- **CI Workflow Unification**
  Progress was made on consolidating CI processes through a single pull request ([#971](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/971)). The goal is to unify local workflows, update to the latest factory workflow, and streamline the building of Docker images for interop services by replacing multiple individual files with a single, consolidated workflow.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month involved resolving a key strategic question and investigating an operational bug affecting node operators.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **ZK Game Challenging Strategy:** A spike to determine how to support challenging ZK games ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18322)) was closed. The decision was made to proceed with implementation within `op-challenger`, clarifying the path forward for this feature.
  - **Documentation:** An issue regarding documentation for `consensus-layer-sync` ([#1895](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/1895)) was closed but can be reopened if more context is provided.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **`op-node` Sync Bug:** An important issue where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18468)) remains active. A community member reported experiencing the same problem and suggested a potential workaround, indicating this may be affecting multiple node operators.
  - **`SuperchainConfig` Porting:** Discussions are ongoing to port the `SuperchainConfig` type from the `superchain-registry` into the specs ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/741)). A pull request ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/867)) has been opened to address this.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community collaboration was evident in the active issue discussions this month. In the `op-node` sync issue ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18468)), a user provided a detailed report and a temporary fix, demonstrating active participation from node operators in troubleshooting real-world problems. Additionally, the discussion around the `SuperchainConfig` type ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/741)) included feedback on technical specifications, highlighting collaborative refinement of core protocol components.
