# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December's efforts focused on both foundational infrastructure and future protocol capabilities. A key strategic decision was made to integrate ZK game challenging directly into `op-challenger`, paving the way for new use cases on the Superchain. Concurrently, significant work was dedicated to streamlining the developer experience by unifying CI workflows. Discussions also progressed on core architectural components like the `SuperchainConfig` type and addressed operational challenges such as an `op-node` sync issue.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving the project's continuous integration infrastructure for better efficiency and maintainability.

- **CI Workflow Unification**
  A pull request ([#971](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/971)) was opened and updated to consolidate CI processes. The goal is to unify local workflows and replace individual Docker build files for interop services with a single, streamlined factory workflow. This refactoring effort aims to simplify maintenance and ensure consistency across the CI pipeline.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month saw the resolution of a key strategic question and active discussion on both architectural and operational challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **ZK Game Strategy Finalized:** A spike to determine how to support challenging ZK games ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18322)) was closed. The decision was made to proceed with an implementation within the existing `op-challenger`, establishing a clear path forward for this feature.
  - **Documentation Maintenance:** A documentation issue ([#1895](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/1895)) was closed, representing routine repository upkeep.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **`op-node` Sync Bug:** An important operational issue where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18468)) remains active. A community member contributed a potential workaround, highlighting an ongoing challenge for node operators.
  - **`SuperchainConfig` Porting:** Discussion continued on porting the `SuperchainConfig` type definition from the registry into the specs ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/741)). This architectural work, tracked in a related PR ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/867)), is crucial for the long-term consistency of the Superchain.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active troubleshooting and refinement of key issues. On the `op-node` sync bug ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18468)), a user shared their experience and a temporary fix, demonstrating community-driven problem-solving. Similarly, discussions around the `SuperchainConfig` port ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/741)) involved feedback on correct syntax and formatting, showcasing collaborative efforts to maintain high standards for specification documents.
