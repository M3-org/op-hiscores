  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 21, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on refining the `superroot_atTimestamp` response format within `op-supernode` and implementing a supernode super root provider in `op-challenger`, enhancing data consistency and error handling.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Supernode Super Root Provider Implementation\nThe `op-challenger` now includes an implementation for a supernode super root provider, which is not yet integrated but has passing unit tests. This update also correctly handles a related issue, adding chain IDs to the `superroot_atTimestamp` response. ([#18653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18653))\n\n### Superroot Response Format and Error Handling Improvements\nThe `op-supernode` has updated its `superroot_atTimestamp` response format. This includes stopping the conversion of all errors into \"not found\" errors and switching to `ethereum.NotFound` as the designated \"not found\" error type for clearer flagging. ([#18652](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18652))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#18666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18666), was opened to address an issue in `op-node` where it should return an error instead of panicking when the L1 chain ID is nil.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Superroot Consistency Concerns\nA new issue, [#18667](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18667), was opened to address potential inconsistencies in `superroot_atTimestamp` responses due to race conditions, requiring a review of the current implementation.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Node Synchronization and Trie Node Errors\nIssue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581) continues to be active, with users experiencing \"missing trie node\" errors and synchronization problems. The latest comments indicate a user, yaki-1337, is seeking information on where to obtain the `geth` version and is considering switching to Reth, after having deleted their previous setup. They also inquired about where to download OP-GETH. Another user, rdin777, previously suggested that \"missing trie node\" errors often indicate an incomplete or corrupted state database and asked for clarification on node type (full/archive), occurrence after unclean shutdowns, and the execution client being used (op-geth or reth). They also suggested trying `--syncmode=full` or checking disk IOPS."
