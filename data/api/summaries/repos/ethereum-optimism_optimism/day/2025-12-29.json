  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 29, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw significant activity in the `op-batcher` and `conductor` components, with multiple new pull requests addressing potential race conditions, nil pointer dereferences, and adding new features for conductor RPC and raft configuration.\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo completed work to report for this period.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nSeveral new pull requests were opened today, focusing on `op-batcher` stability, `conductor` features, and contract testing:\n- **`op-batcher` Stability Improvements:** Two pull requests aim to enhance the robustness of the `op-batcher`. [#18702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18702) seeks to prevent a race condition in the `receiptsLoop`, while [#18701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18701) addresses a potential nil pointer dereference in `getReadyChannel`.\n- **`conductor` Feature Enhancements:** Three new pull requests introduce new functionalities and fixes for the `conductor`. [#18700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18700) adds a `demote-voter` RPC command, and [#18699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18699) introduces a raft configuration option to allow no shutdown on removal. Additionally, [#18697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18697) proposes a fix for the leader loop switch by implementing round-robin leadership transfer.\n- **Contract Test Coverage:** [#18696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18696) focuses on improving test coverage for the `OptimismMintableERC20` contract.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo closed issues to report for this period.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- **`op-batcher` Data Availability Concerns:** A new question has been raised regarding potential problems when running `op-batcher` with `--data-availability-type=callData` [#18698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18698). The user is inquiring if this configuration, which bypasses blob storage in favor of callData, eliminates the need to configure L1 beacon in `op-node` and `op-challenger`.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments to report for this period."
