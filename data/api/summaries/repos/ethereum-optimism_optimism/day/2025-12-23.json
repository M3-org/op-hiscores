  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 23, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes, specifically addressing port collisions in acceptance tests, and minor code clarifications.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements\n- **Flashblocks Acceptance Test Port Collisions:** A bug causing port collisions during flashblocks acceptance tests was fixed, resolving \"address already in use\" errors. This involved changes across several `op-devstack` files to ensure proper port management. ([#18684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18684))\n\n### Code Clarity\n- **Comment Clarification in op-node:** A comment in `op-node` was clarified to prevent potential confusion, which had previously led to an innocuous security report. ([#18512](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18512))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#18691](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18691) check-prestate: handle go module pseudo-versions and fix kona prestate name\n- [#18690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18690) Use https for git submodules\n- [#18689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18689) asterisc: Remove asterisc contracts\n- [#18688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18688) fix(op-preimage): disable setnonblock in windows\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."
