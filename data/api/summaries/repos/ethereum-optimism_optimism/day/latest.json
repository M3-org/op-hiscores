  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 23, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes, specifically addressing port collisions in acceptance tests, and minor code clarifications.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements\nA significant bug fix was implemented to resolve port collision issues in `op-acceptance-tests`, which previously caused errors like \"address already in use\" during flashblocks acceptance tests. This involved modifications across several files in `op-devstack/sysgo` and `op-devstack/dsl` to ensure proper port handling. ([#18684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18684))\n\n### Code Clarity and Maintenance\nA comment in `op-node/rollup/derive/batches.go` was clarified to prevent potential confusion, which had previously led to an innocuous security report. ([#18512](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18512))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#18691](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18691), was opened to handle Go module pseudo-versions and fix the Kona prestate name in `check-prestate`.\n- Another PR, [#18690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18690), proposes using HTTPS for Git submodules.\n- [#18689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18689) aims to remove asterisc contracts.\n- Two identical pull requests, [#18688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18688) and [#18687](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18687), were opened to disable `setnonblock` in Windows for `op-preimage`.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."
