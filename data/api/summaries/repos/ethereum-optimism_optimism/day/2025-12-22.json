  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/optimism Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on refining testing processes, particularly by skipping redundant AI-driven tests for already well-covered components. Several new pull requests were opened, addressing dependency updates, CI/CD improvements, and new contract features. A number of new issues were also identified, primarily concerning `kona-node` and contract deployment challenges.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Test Optimization and Coverage Review**\n    *   Skipped AI-generated tests for `StandardBridge.t.sol` as it already has comprehensive coverage, streamlining the testing process ([#18671](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18671)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   **Dependency and Infrastructure Updates**\n    *   Multiple `dependabot` PRs were opened to bump `golang.org/x/crypto` ([#18683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18683)), `github.com/docker/docker` ([#18682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18682)), `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace` ([#18681](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18681)), and `golang.org/x/mod` ([#18680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18680)).\n    *   A PR was opened to fix port collisions in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#18684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18684)).\n    *   The migration of Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions is being completed ([#18678](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18678)).\n*   **Contract and Challenger Enhancements**\n    *   A new feature for `DelegatedDisputeGame` for the Super Dispute Game system was proposed ([#18677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18677)).\n    *   A PR was opened to ensure all immutable variables in `OPContractsManagerV2` start with `opcM` unless otherwise allowed ([#18679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18679)).\n    *   Work is underway to remove asterisc support from `op-challenger/op-dispute-mon` ([#18670](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18670)) and integrate the super node trace provider into `op-challenger` ([#18668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18668)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n*   **Light CL Implementation for op-node**\n    *   The implementation of an external source following for safe/finalized data in `op-node` using the `--l2.follow.source` flag has been completed ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18317)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n*   **Contract Deployment and `kona-node` Challenges**\n    *   A bug was reported where OP Stack contract deployment fails on fresh EVM environments due to the 24KB contract size limit, which is masked on Mainnet and Sepolia by pre-deployed contracts ([#18685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18685)).\n    *   Several issues related to `kona-node` were opened, including the need to update the `vm-runner` to use the super node instead of the supervisor ([#18669](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18669)), the implementation of a light CL ([#18672](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18672)), and a revision of `SyncStatus CurrentL1 Selection` where `current_l1` is incorrectly set to the latest L1 head ([#18673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18673)).\n    *   Further `kona-node` issues include revising sequencer detection during test bootstrapping ([#18674](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18674)), the `TestSequencerPreset` not supporting `kona` sequencer ([#18675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18675)), and checking L2 reorgs due to L1 reorgs ([#18676](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18676)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n*   **`op-challenger`: Review correct trace output when next super root is not found** ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18643))\n    *   The discussion confirms that the super node trace provider now correctly handles cases where the next super root is not found.\n    *   While the `op-supervisor` doesn't need fixing as it's being deprecated, an integration test is still required to ensure `op-challenger` and `op-program` match up.\n    *   Initial analysis suggested a potential problem with the `op-program` transitioning to an invalid hash with insufficient data, and questions were raised about the correctness of the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test.\n    *   There was also a note on the `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC returning a \"not found\" error if any chain isn't supported by L1, even if the supervisor's superroot RPC is okay with returning super roots for blocks that aren't cross-safe."
