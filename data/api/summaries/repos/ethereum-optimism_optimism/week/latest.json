A major milestone was achieved with the completion of the `op-node` Light CL \"Follow External Source\" feature, enhancing node flexibility. The team also released a substantial upgrade for the `op-deployer` and `op-validator` tools. Concurrently, critical bugs were addressed, including a deployment blocker in `op-contracts` and several integration challenges with the `kona-node`, setting the stage for future work on protocol stability and testing.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on architectural evolution, tooling upgrades, and critical bug fixes.\n\n- **Supernode Integration & Challenger Enhancements:**\n  Progress was made on replacing the `op-supervisor` with the `op-supernode`. A new super root provider for the `op-supernode` was implemented in `op-challenger` ([#18653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18653)), and the `superroot_atTimestamp` RPC response format was refined for clearer error handling ([#18652](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18652)). This foundational work supports the ongoing transition to a more streamlined architecture.\n\n- **Tooling Upgrades & Maintenance:**\n  The `op-deployer` and `op-validator` tools were upgraded to v6.0.0, incorporating new validation tests to ensure functionality ([#18662](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18662)). In a minor optimization, a redundant AI-generated test was skipped to streamline the CI process ([#18671](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18671)).\n\n- **Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements:**\n  Several key bugs were resolved to improve system stability and developer experience:\n  - A port collision issue in `op-acceptance-tests` that caused \"address already in use\" errors was fixed ([#18684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18684)).\n  - A compatibility bug affecting `op-preimage` on Windows was addressed by disabling `setnonblock` ([#18687](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18687)).\n  - A code comment in `op-node` was clarified to prevent potential misinterpretation following a security report ([#18512](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18512)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  The most significant closure was the completion of the `op-node` Light CL \"Follow External Source\" feature ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18317)). This allows an `op-node` to mirror an external safe/finalized feed, a key capability for the Superchain ecosystem.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - **Critical Deployment Bug:** A new issue ([#18685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18685)) identified a critical bug in `op-contracts` where deployment fails on fresh EVM environments due to the 24KB contract size limit. This represents a potential blocker for new chain deployments.\n  - **`kona-node` Challenges:** A cluster of related issues ([#18672](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18672), [#18673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18673), [#18674](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18674), [#18675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18675), [#18676](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18676)) was opened, highlighting difficulties with `kona-node` synchronization, sequencer detection, and testing within `op-devstack`.\n  - **Architectural Direction:** An issue was created to formally track the update of `vm-runner` to use the `op-supernode` ([#18669](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18669)), reinforcing the strategic move away from the `op-supervisor`.\n  - **Ongoing Node Sync Problems:** Discussions continue in [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18581) around \"missing trie node\" errors, indicating persistent synchronization challenges for users running `op-geth`.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThis week saw focused efforts across different components of the stack. The cluster of issues opened for `kona-node` suggests a dedicated integration testing effort that successfully surfaced several areas for improvement. An inquiry regarding the architecture of the new `OptimisticZkGame` ([#18692](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18692)) demonstrates active community interest in the project's evolving dispute game mechanisms. Furthermore, the quick action to clarify a code comment based on a security report ([#18512](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18512)) highlights a healthy and responsive feedback loop between the core team and the wider community."
