Discussions continued on an active issue regarding correct trace output in op-challenger, with an update on its current status.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new technical developments were completed today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#1928](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1928), was opened to add a guide for revenue sharing automation.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### op-challenger Trace Output Review\nDiscussion continued on [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18643) regarding the correct trace output when the next super root is not found. The latest comment from ajsutton confirms that this functionality now works correctly in the super node trace provider. It was noted that a fix for op-supervisor is not needed as it is being deleted, but the issue will remain open until an integration test confirms op-challenger and op-program alignment. Previously, Inphi identified this as a real problem, noting that op-program transitions to an invalid hash with insufficient data and questioning the correctness of a specific test."
