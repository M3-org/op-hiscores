This includes adding game type 0, setting the respected game type to 0, and upgrading the `superchainConfig` to v600. This work lays the groundwork for future betanet upgrades. ([#1319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1319))\n\n### L2 Simulation Documentation Fix\nA bug in the `simulate-l2-ownership-transfer.md` how-to guide was fixed. The documentation previously incorrectly stated that the \"From\" address in L2 simulation should be the L2 transaction parameter, instead of the aliased caller from L1. This correction improves the accuracy of developer guidance. ([#1291](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1291))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#1326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1326) Betanet u18 tasks update\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."
