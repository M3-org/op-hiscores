  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing the robustness of multisig tasks by adding gas limit checks and preparing for Upgrade 18 with new templates and regression tests. An important issue regarding op-node's light client following external sources was closed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Multisig Task Gas Limit Enforcement\nA new feature was added to revert multisig tasks if the required gas limit approaches the Fusaka transaction gas cap. This improves the reliability and safety of multisig operations by preventing out-of-gas errors. ([#1277](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1277))\n\n### Upgrade 18 Preparation\nWork was completed to integrate the templates, example tasks, and regression tests necessary for Upgrade 18. This includes new Solidity files for `OPCMUpgradeSuperchainConfigV600` and `OPCMUpgradeV600`, along with associated configuration files and environment settings. ([#1313](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1313))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n### op-node Light Client Implementation\nThe issue concerning the implementation of external following for safe/finalized data in `op-node`'s light client was closed. The `op-node` now supports the `--l2.follow.source` flag to mirror external safe/finalized feeds, with the implementation confirmed as complete. ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18317))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### op-challenger: Review correct trace output when next super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18643))\nDiscussion on this issue confirms that the super node trace provider now correctly handles cases where the next super root is not found. While `op-supervisor` will be deleted, the issue remains open pending an integration test to ensure `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments highlighted that `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash with insufficient data, and there were concerns about the correctness of a specific test and the behavior of `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC in `op-supervisor`."
