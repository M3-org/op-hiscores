  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw the opening of three new pull requests, including a new devnet task and a fix for data validation. Two issues were closed, one related to blob priority fee tracking and another concerning a possible bug in op-node sequencer recovery mode. A new issue was also opened regarding an artifact extraction bug.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo completed work was reported for this day.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nThree new pull requests were opened today:\n- [#1325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1325) introduces a new post-task assertion for testing.\n- [#1324](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1324) adds a new devnet task.\n- [#1323](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1323) provides a fix by adding checks for all data to sign during validation.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Blob Priority Fee Tracking\nIssue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18102), concerning blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr`, was closed today. The discussion highlighted that the blob tip oracle is now deployed to production, and the current configuration is overpaying compared to the oracle's suggestion. The oracle is currently informational, but its use is being considered for future optimization.\n\n### Op-node Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug\nIssue [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18350), which reported a possible bug in op-node sequencer recovery mode, was closed. While the specific drift issue could not be reproduced, related L1 origin code in op-node was refactored, and a similar fix was adopted to prevent errors when the L1 origin is up to tip. The issue may be reopened if the drift problem reoccurs.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Artifact Extraction Bug\nA new issue, [#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18663), was opened regarding a bug in `ExtractFromFile()` within `op-deployer/pkg/deployer/artifacts/embedded.go`. The function incorrectly expects an `out/` directory inside the tarball, whereas the `mktar` tool packages artifacts with a `forge-artifacts/` prefix. This discrepancy breaks self-hosted `.tzst` artifacts.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments were reported for this day."
