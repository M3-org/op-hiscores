  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw a minor update to Dune pulls, alongside the closure of two significant issues related to blob priority fee tracking and a potential bug in op-node sequencer recovery mode. A new issue regarding artifact extraction was also opened.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Dune Pulls Modification\nA minor modification was made to the Dune pulls, affecting the `.circleci/config.yml` and `other_chains_tracking/get_qualified_txs.ipynb` files. ([#1777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1777))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNone\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Blob Priority Fee Tracking Resolution\nThe issue concerning blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr` has been closed. Discussions highlighted that the blob tip oracle is now deployed to production, revealing that the current `min blob cap` configuration value (4 gwei) leads to overpayment compared to the oracle's suggestion (2.51 gwei). While currently informational, the oracle's data is expected to be utilized soon. ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18102))\n\n### Sequencer Recover Mode Bug Investigation\nThe potential bug in `op-node` sequencer recover mode has been closed. The investigation led to refactoring of the L1 origin code in `op-node` and a fix to prevent errors when the L1 origin is up to tip. Although the original drift issue was not reproduced, the related improvements have been implemented. ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18350))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Artifact Extraction Discrepancy\nA new bug has been reported where `ExtractFromFile()` in `op-deployer/pkg/deployer/artifacts/embedded.go` expects an `out/` directory within the tarball, but the `mktar` tool packages artifacts with a `forge-artifacts/` prefix. This discrepancy breaks self-hosted `.tzst` artifacts. ([#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18663))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."
