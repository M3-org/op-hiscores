  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/op-analytics Weekly Report (Dec 28 - 3, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis was a quiet week for the `op-analytics` project, with development activity focused on essential maintenance. The primary action involved dependency cleanup to improve the project's stability and ease of installation. This housekeeping effort resolved installation conflicts by removing an unused package, ensuring a smoother experience for developers and contributors.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on improving the project's underlying configuration and maintainability.\n\n### Dependency Management\n- A minor but important maintenance task was completed to remove the 'sugar' dependency. This package was identified as a source of installation problems in other projects and was not actively used within `op-analytics`. Its removal from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` streamlines the dependency tree and prevents future conflicts ([#1778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1778)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThere was no significant activity regarding issues this week.\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no notable discussions on existing issues reported during this period.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe development period was quiet from a community standpoint. The provided reports did not indicate any significant collaborative discussions, new contributor activity, or PRs with a high degree of review interaction."
