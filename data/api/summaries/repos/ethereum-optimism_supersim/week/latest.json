  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/supersim Weekly Report (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts centered on advancing the reliability of core protocol components. A key milestone was the completed implementation of external source following for `op-node`'s light client, allowing nodes to mirror external safe and finalized data feeds. Concurrently, active discussions progressed on ensuring the `op-challenger` produces correct trace outputs, particularly in edge cases where a super root is not found. While no new code was merged, the focus remained on resolving critical issues and verifying component interactions.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nNo pull requests were merged this week, indicating a focus on issue resolution and discussion rather than new feature integration or code changes.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n### Closed Issues:\n- **`op-node` Light Client Enhancement:** The implementation for external source following in `op-node` was completed, closing issue [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18317). This feature, enabled by the `--l2.follow.source` flag, allows a node to mirror an external feed to reach its safe and finalized state.\n\n### New & Active Issues:\n- No new issues were opened this week.\n- **`op-challenger` Trace Output Discussion:** Discussions continued on issue [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18643), which addresses the `op-challenger`'s behavior when the next super root is not found. It was confirmed that the super node trace provider now correctly handles this scenario. The issue remains open pending an integration test to ensure alignment between `op-challenger` and `op-program`. It was also noted that the related component `op-supervisor` will not be fixed, as it is slated for deletion.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was concentrated within issue discussions. The conversation around `op-challenger` trace output ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18643)) highlighted a focused effort to diagnose and confirm the correct behavior between different system components, demonstrating cross-component coordination to ensure protocol correctness."
