  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/supersim Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on resolving an issue related to the `op-node`'s light client functionality for following external sources, with the implementation now complete. Discussions also continued on an `op-challenger` issue concerning trace output when the next super root is not found.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### `op-node` Light Client External Source Following\nIssue [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18317) regarding the `op-node`'s light client following external sources for safe/finalized data has been closed. The `op-node` implementation for supporting the `--l2.follow.source` flag is now complete, allowing it to mirror external safe/finalized feeds.\n\n### `op-challenger` Trace Output Review\nDiscussion continued on issue [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18643) concerning the `op-challenger`'s trace output when the next super root is not found. The latest comment confirms that the super node trace provider now handles this correctly. While `op-supervisor` will not be fixed due to its impending deletion, the issue remains open pending an integration test to verify `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments highlighted that this was a real problem, with `op-program` transitioning to an invalid hash on the first chain with insufficient data. There was also a discussion about the correctness of the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test and the behavior of the `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC in `op-supervisor`."
