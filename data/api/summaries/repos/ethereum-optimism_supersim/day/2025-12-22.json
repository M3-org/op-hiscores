  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/supersim Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on resolving an issue related to the `op-node`'s light client functionality, specifically the implementation of external source following for safe/finalized data. Discussions also continued on an `op-challenger` issue regarding correct trace output when the next super root is not found.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, tests added, or other work were completed today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n**Light Client External Source Following Implemented**\nThe implementation of external following for safe/finalized data using the `--l2.follow.source` flag in `op-node` has been completed. This allows the node to mirror external safe/finalized feeds, enabling it to reach the safe/finalized state. ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18317))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n**Review of `op-challenger` Trace Output for Missing Super Root**\nDiscussions continued on the issue of `op-challenger`'s trace output when the next super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim/issues/18643)). The latest comment confirms that the super node trace provider now handles this scenario correctly. While `op-supervisor` will not be fixed due to its impending deletion, the issue remains open pending an integration test to confirm `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments highlighted that this is a real problem, with `op-program` transitioning to an invalid hash on the first chain with insufficient data. There was also a discussion about the correctness of a specific test and the behavior of the `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC in `op-supervisor`."
