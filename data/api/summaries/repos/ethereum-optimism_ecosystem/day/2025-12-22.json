  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/ecosystem Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, development focused on infrastructure improvements with a new pull request to migrate Docker builds to GitHub Actions. An issue related to `op-node`'s light client following external sources was closed, indicating progress in that area. Discussions continued on an `op-challenger` issue regarding trace output.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#972](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/972), was opened to complete the migration of Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n### op-node Light Client External Following\nThe issue [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18317), concerning the `op-node`'s light client following external sources for safe/finalized data, has been closed. The goal was to implement support for the `--l2.follow.source` flag, and the `op-node` implementation is now complete.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### op-challenger Trace Output Review\nDiscussion continued on [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/issues/18643), which addresses reviewing the correct trace output in `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found. The latest comment from ajsutton confirms that this now works correctly in the super node trace provider. It also notes that a fix for `op-supervisor` is not needed as it is being deleted, but the issue should remain open until an integration test confirms `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Previous comments highlighted that the `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash on the first chain with insufficient data and questioned the correctness of a specific test related to `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead`."
