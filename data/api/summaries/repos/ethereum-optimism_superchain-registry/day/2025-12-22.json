  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw updates to standard versions for mainnet and Sepolia, along with a critical CI fix to align `circleci-utils` with the main Optimism repository. An issue related to `op-node`'s light client following external sources was closed, indicating progress in that area.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Standard Version Updates\nNew standard versions, specifically `v6.0.0-rc.1`, were added for both mainnet and Sepolia, indicating ongoing development and release preparation for the Superchain. ([#1187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1187))\n\n### CI Configuration Alignment\nA fix was implemented to update `circleci-utils` to match the configuration used in the main Optimism repository, ensuring consistency and stability in the continuous integration pipeline. ([#1188](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1188))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### op-node Light Client Implementation\nThe issue concerning the `op-node`'s light client implementation to follow external sources for safe/finalized data has been closed, with the `op-node` implementation confirmed as complete. ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18317))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### op-challenger: Trace Output Review\nDiscussion continues on [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18643) regarding the `op-challenger`'s trace output when the next super root is not found. The latest comment confirms that the super node trace provider now handles this correctly. While `op-supervisor` won't be fixed due to its impending deletion, the issue remains open pending an integration test to confirm `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments highlighted a potential problem with `op-program` transitioning to an invalid hash with insufficient data and questioned the correctness of a specific test in the `super` provider."
