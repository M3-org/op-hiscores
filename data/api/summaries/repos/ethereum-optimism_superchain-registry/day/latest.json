  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw updates to standard versions for mainnet and Sepolia, along with a critical CI fix to align `circleci-utils` with the main Optimism repository. An issue related to `op-node`'s light client following external sources was closed, indicating progress on that front.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Standard Version Updates\nNew standard versions, specifically `v6.0.0-rc.1`, were added for both mainnet and Sepolia, indicating ongoing development and release preparation for the Superchain. ([#1187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1187))\n\n### CI Configuration Alignment\nA fix was implemented to update `circleci-utils` to match the configuration used in the main Optimism repository, ensuring consistency and stability in the continuous integration pipeline. ([#1188](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1188))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### `op-node` Light Client Implementation\nThe issue concerning the `op-node`'s light client implementation to follow external sources for safe/finalized data has been closed, with the `op-node` implementation confirmed as complete. ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18317))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### `op-challenger`: Review correct trace output when next super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/issues/18643))\nThe discussion on this issue revolves around the correct behavior of `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found. The latest comment confirms that the super node trace provider now handles this correctly. While `op-supervisor` won't be fixed due to its impending deletion, the issue remains open pending an integration test to confirm `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments highlighted that `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash with insufficient data and questioned the correctness of a specific test in the super root provider. There was also a note that the `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC returns a \"not found\" error if any chain isn't supported by L1, even if the supervisor's superroot RPC can return super roots for non-cross-safe blocks."
