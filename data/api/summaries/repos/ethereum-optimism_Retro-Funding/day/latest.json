  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on dependency updates with a new pull request to bump `marshmallow`. A significant issue regarding external source following for `op-node` was closed, indicating progress in light client functionality. Discussions continued on an `op-challenger` issue concerning trace output.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new technical developments were completed today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request was opened to update the `marshmallow` dependency from version 3.26.1 to 3.26.2 [#91](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/pull/91). This is a routine dependency bump.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### `op-node` Light Client External Source Following Implemented\nThe issue concerning the implementation of external following for safe/finalized data in `op-node` using the `--l2.follow.source` flag has been closed [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18317). This indicates that the `op-node` now supports mirroring external safe/finalized feeds, allowing the node to reach the safe/finalized tip.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### `op-challenger`: Review correct trace output when next super root is not found\nDiscussion continued on the issue regarding `op-challenger`'s trace output when the next super root is not found [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Retro-Funding/issues/18643). The latest comment confirms that the `super node trace provider` now handles this correctly. While `op-supervisor` is being deprecated, the issue remains open pending an integration test to ensure `op-challenger` and `op-program` align. Earlier comments highlighted this as a real problem, noting that `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash with insufficient data and questioning the correctness of a specific test case. The logic for `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC was also discussed, suggesting it returns a \"not found\" error if any chain is not supported by L1."
