  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on infrastructure improvements with new pull requests for graceful server shutdown and migration of Docker builds to GitHub Actions. Progress was also made on an `op-node` light client issue and an `op-challenger` trace output review.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Infrastructure Enhancements\nTwo new pull requests were opened to improve the project's infrastructure. One introduces a feature for graceful server shutdown in `proxyd` ([#533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/533)), which is crucial for maintaining service availability and data integrity during restarts. The other focuses on migrating Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions ([#532](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/532)), streamlining the CI/CD pipeline and potentially improving build efficiency.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **feat(proxyd): graceful server shutdown** ([#533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/533)): This pull request introduces a new feature to `proxyd` for graceful server shutdown, aiming to improve system stability.\n- **ci: complete migration of docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions** ([#532](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/532)): This PR marks the completion of the migration of Docker build processes from CircleCI to GitHub Actions, enhancing the continuous integration workflow.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### `op-node` Light Client External Source Following\nThe issue regarding the `op-node` light client following an external source ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18317)) saw a significant update. The latest comment confirms that the `op-node` implementation for this feature is now complete, indicating progress towards enabling the node to mirror external safe/finalized data using the `--l2.follow.source` flag.\n\n### `op-challenger` Trace Output Review\nDiscussion continued on the `op-challenger` issue concerning the correct trace output when the next super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18643)). The most recent comment from ajsutton confirms that the super node trace provider now correctly handles this scenario. It also notes that `op-supervisor` does not require a fix as it is being deprecated. The issue remains open pending an integration test to verify `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments from Inphi highlighted this as a real problem, noting that `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash with insufficient data and questioning the correctness of a specific test in `op-challenger`."
