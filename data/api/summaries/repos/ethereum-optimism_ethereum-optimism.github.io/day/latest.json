  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on adding a new token to the World Chain Sepolia testnet. Additionally, two significant issues related to `op-batcher` blob priority fee tracking and `op-node` sequencer recovery mode were closed after extensive discussion and investigation.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Token Integration\nA new token, AMIE, was added to the World Chain Sepolia testnet, including its details and logo. This expands the supported tokens within the ecosystem. ([#1243](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1243))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#1248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1248), was opened to add the Canonical SKL Deployment from Ethereum to Base.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Blob Priority Fee Optimization\nThe issue concerning `op-batcher/txmgr` blob priority fee tracking ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18102)) has been closed. Discussions highlighted that the blob tip oracle is now deployed to production, and the current configuration is overpaying compared to the oracle's suggestions. The oracle, based on the 60th percentile, suggests a priority fee of approximately `2.51 gwei`, while the `min blob cap` is set at `4 gwei`. The oracle is currently informational, but its use is anticipated soon.\n\n### Sequencer Recovery Mode Refinement\nThe potential bug in `op-node` sequencer recover mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18350)) has been closed. Although the specific drift issue could not be reproduced, related L1 origin code in `op-node` was refactored, and a fix was adopted to prevent errors when the L1 origin is up to tip. The issue may be reopened if the drift problem reoccurs.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Artifact Extraction Bug\nA new issue, [#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18663), was reported regarding `op-deployer/pkg/deployer/artifacts/embedded.go`. The `ExtractFromFile()` function expects an `out/` directory within the tarball, but the `mktar` tool packages artifacts with a `forge-artifacts/` prefix, leading to a breakage in self-hosted `.tzst` artifacts.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."
