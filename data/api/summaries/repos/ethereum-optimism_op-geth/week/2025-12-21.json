  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's activity centered on enhancing infrastructure and ensuring the correctness of core components. A significant effort was initiated to complete the migration of Docker builds to GitHub Actions, aiming to streamline CI/CD processes. On the feature front, work was completed to enable external following for safe/finalized data in `op-node`, a key implementation for node operators. Additionally, active discussions are focused on improving the reliability of the fault-proof system by ensuring correct trace outputs in `op-challenger`.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this period focused on improving the project's development infrastructure.\n- **CI/CD Migration:** A new pull request ([#740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/740)) was opened to finalize the migration of Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions. This move continues the effort to consolidate and improve the project's continuous integration and deployment pipelines.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** A key issue was resolved, enhancing node functionality.\n  - **`op-node` External Following:** Issue [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18317) was closed, confirming that `op-node` now successfully supports external following for safe/finalized data via the `--l2.follow.source` flag.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Discussions on active issues are focused on the correctness and integration of the fault-proof system.\n  - **`op-challenger` Trace Output:** There is an ongoing discussion in issue [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18643) regarding the correct trace output when a super root is not found. While a fix has been implemented in the super node trace provider, the issue remains open pending an integration test to verify alignment between `op-challenger` and `op-program`, ensuring system-wide consistency.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\n- The discussion on issue [#18643] highlights active collaboration between contributors to ensure the correctness of interactions between different components of the stack, specifically `op-challenger`, `op-program`, and `op-supervisor`. The emphasis on adding an integration test before closing the issue demonstrates a strong commitment to quality and robustness."
