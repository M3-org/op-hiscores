An important issue regarding external following for safe/finalized data in `op-node` was closed, indicating successful implementation. Discussions continued on an `op-challenger` issue related to trace output.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/740), was opened to complete the migration of Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions, indicating a continued effort to streamline CI/CD processes.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- **`op-node` External Following Implementation:** Issue [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18317) was closed, confirming the successful implementation of external following for safe/finalized data in `op-node` using the `--l2.follow.source` flag.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n- **`op-challenger` Trace Output Review:** Discussion continued on issue [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18643) regarding the correct trace output when the next super root is not found. The latest comment from ajsutton confirms that the super node trace provider now handles this correctly and suggests keeping the issue open until an integration test verifies the alignment between `op-challenger` and `op-program`. Previous comments from Inphi highlighted this as a real problem and discussed the behavior of `op-program` and `op-supervisor` in such scenarios."
