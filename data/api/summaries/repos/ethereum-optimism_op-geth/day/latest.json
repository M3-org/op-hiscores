  "content": "# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw a significant step in CI/CD migration with a new pull request to complete Docker build migration to GitHub Actions. An important issue regarding external following for safe/finalized data in `op-node` was closed, indicating successful implementation. Discussions continued on an `op-challenger` issue related to trace output.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/740), was opened to complete the migration of Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions, streamlining the continuous integration process.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- The issue [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18317), concerning the implementation of external following for safe/finalized data in `op-node` using the `--l2.follow.source` flag, was closed. This indicates that the `op-node` implementation for mirroring external safe/finalized feeds is complete.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n- Discussion continued on [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18643), which addresses the review of correct trace output in `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found. The latest comment from ajsutton confirms that this functionality now works correctly in the super node trace provider. While `op-supervisor` will not be fixed as it's being deleted, the issue remains open pending an integration test to confirm `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments from Inphi highlighted this as a real problem, noting that `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash with insufficient data and questioning the correctness of a specific test."
