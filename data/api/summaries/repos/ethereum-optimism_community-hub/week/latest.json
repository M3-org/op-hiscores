The sole development was the submission of a new pull request aimed at updating a configuration file. No new issues were opened or closed, and there were no major technical developments reported.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe week's development work was focused on a single configuration update.\n\n*   **Configuration:** A new pull request, [#1200](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/pull/1200), was opened to make changes to the `config.yml` file.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe issue tracker was quiet this week, with no movement reported.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and no significant activity was reported on existing issues.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity interaction was very light this week. The single pull request opened did not generate significant discussion according to the provided reports, and there was no other notable collaborative activity."
