  "content": "Inphi: Focused on foundational improvements and bug fixes within the Optimism ecosystem, contributing to a significant open PR (ethereum-optimism/optimism#18619) to fix host arguments for the challenger, while also creating two new issues (ethereum-optimism/optimism#18621, ethereum-optimism/optimism#18620) to address supernode testing and L2OO support. Their work involved modifying 38 files with a net addition of 796 lines, primarily split between other work and bug fixes, with an even distribution between code and test files."
