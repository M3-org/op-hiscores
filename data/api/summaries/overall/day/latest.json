  "content": "Dec 29, 2025\n\nToday's development focused on enhancing the stability and features of the `optimism` repository, particularly for `op-batcher` and `conductor` components, alongside minor dependency cleanup in `op-analytics`. Key new pull requests address potential race conditions and nil pointer dereferences in `op-batcher`, introduce new RPC commands and configuration options for `conductor`, and improve contract test coverage. A new issue was raised concerning `op-batcher` data availability with `callData` for new chains.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - `optimism`: A new question has been raised regarding potential problems when running `op-batcher` with `--data-availability-type=callData` for new chains, seeking clarification on whether this configuration introduces any issues. [#18698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18698)\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Dependency Management\n- `op-analytics`: The 'sugar' package was removed from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` as it was not actively used and caused installation problems in other projects. [#1778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1778)\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:\n    - `op-batcher` Stability Improvements:\n        - Addresses a potential race condition in `receiptsLoop`. [#18702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18702)\n        - Tackles a nil pointer dereference in `getReadyChannel`. [#18701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18701)\n    - `conductor` Feature Enhancements:\n        - Adds a `demote-voter` RPC command. [#18700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18700)\n        - Introduces a raft configuration option to allow no shutdown on removal. [#18699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18699)\n        - Aims to fix a leader loop switch issue by implementing round-robin leadership transfer. [#18697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18697)\n    - Contract Test Coverage:\n        - Focuses on improving test coverage for `OptimismMintableERC20` contracts. [#18696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18696)\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:\n    - `op-batcher` Data Availability Concerns: A new question has been raised regarding potential problems when running `op-batcher` with `--data-availability-type=callData` for new chains.
