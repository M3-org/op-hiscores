  "content": "Today's development focused on enhancing the stability and features of the `optimism` repository, particularly within the `op-batcher` and `conductor` components, alongside minor dependency cleanup in `op-analytics`. Key activities included addressing potential race conditions and nil pointer dereferences in `op-batcher`, introducing new RPC commands and configuration options for `conductor`, and improving contract test coverage. A new issue was raised concerning `op-batcher` data availability when using `callData`.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - ethereum-optimism/optimism: A new question has been raised regarding potential problems when running `op-batcher` with `--data-availability-type=callData` and its implications for L1 beacon configuration in `op-node` and `op-challenger` ([#18698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18698)). Input is needed to clarify this configuration.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Dependency Management**:\n    - Removed the 'sugar' dependency from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` in `op-analytics` as it was unused and caused installation issues ([#1778](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1778)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**:\n    - **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:\n        - `op-batcher` Stability Improvements:\n            - Prevent race condition in `receiptsLoop` ([#18702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18702))\n            - Address nil pointer dereference in `getReadyChannel` ([#18701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18701))\n        - `conductor` Feature Enhancements:\n            - Add `demote-voter` RPC command ([#18700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18700))\n            - Introduce raft configuration option to allow no shutdown on removal ([#18699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18699))\n            - Fix leader loop switch by implementing round-robin leadership transfer ([#18697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18697))\n        - Contract Test Coverage:\n            - Improve test coverage for `OptimismMintableERC20` contract ([#18696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18696))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n- **New Issues**:\n    - **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:\n        - `op-batcher` Data Availability Concerns: Question raised about running `op-batcher` with `--data-availability-type=callData` and its impact on L1 beacon configuration ([#18698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18698))."
