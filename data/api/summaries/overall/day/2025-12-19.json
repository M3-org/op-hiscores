  "content": "Today, Optimism developers focused heavily on enhancing deployment capabilities with OPCM v2 support and improving blob transaction management through a new `BlobGasPriceOracle`. A significant cross-repository effort was made to close long-standing issues related to blob priority fee tracking and `op-node` sequencer recovery, while a new critical bug concerning artifact extraction paths emerged across multiple repositories.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussion**: `ethereum-optimism/design-docs` [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18102) - The blob tip oracle is deployed and suggests `op-batcher` is overpaying for blob transactions, requiring integration of oracle suggestions into fee calculation.\n- **Urgent Discussion**: `ethereum-optimism/docs` [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18102) - The `op-batcher` is logging warnings about the suggested `blobTipCap` being lower than the configured minimum, indicating a need to utilize the oracle's data for fee optimization.\n- **New Bug**: `ethereum-optimism/design-docs` [#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/18663) - `ExtractFromFile()` in `op-deployer` expects `out/` but should expect `forge-artifacts/`, breaking self-hosted `.tzst` artifacts. This issue is also reported in `ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops` [#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/issues/18663), `ethereum-optimism/op-analytics` [#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/issues/18663), `ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io` [#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/issues/18663), `ethereum-optimism/docs` [#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/18663), and `ethereum-optimism/optimism` [#18663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18663).\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### Protocol Simplification & Core Infrastructure\n- **Kona Node Actor Design Simplification**: A proposal was introduced to simplify the Kona node actor design, aiming to decrease complexity and increase testability by consolidating and deleting unnecessary code without altering functionality. [ethereum-optimism/design-docs#358](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/pull/358)\n- **Blob Gas Price Oracle Module**: A new `BlobGasPriceOracle` module was introduced in `op-service` to track and cache blob prices from new blocks and headers, similar to the existing `GasPriceOracle`. [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18386)\n\n### Deployment & Developer Experience Enhancements\n- **OPCM v2 Support in `op-deployer`**: `op-deployer` received a major upgrade with support for OP Contracts Manager v2 (OPCM v2), enabling more robust chain upgrades including version detection and handling of `UpgradeInputV2`. [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18593](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18593)\n- **`op-deployer` Max Code Size Limit Ignored**: `op-deployer` was updated to ignore max-code-size limits during deployment, improving the developer experience for devnet setups. [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18642)\n- **Dune Pulls Modification**: A minor modification was made to the Dune pulls, affecting the `.circleci/config.yml` and `other_chains_tracking/get_qualified_txs.ipynb` files. [ethereum-optimism/op-analytics#1777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/pull/1777)\n- **World Chain Sepolia Token Integration**: A new token, AMIE, was added to the World Chain Sepolia testnet, including its details and logo, expanding supported tokens. [ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io#1243](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/1243)\n\n### Sync Tester & Devstack Improvements\n- **`op-sync-tester` `engine_exchangeCapabilities` Support**: The `op-sync-tester` now supports `engine_exchangeCapabilities`, a requirement for Kona integration. [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18628)\n- **`op-devstack` Kona Light CL Support**: `op-devstack` was updated to support Kona light CL by allowing the `KONA_NODE_L2_FOLLOW_SOURCE` environment variable. [ethereum-optimism/optimism#18627](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18627)\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n\n### New Pull Requests\n- **ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops**\n    - [#1325](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1325) introduces a new post-task assertion for testing.\n    -
