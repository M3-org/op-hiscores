  "content": "## Overall Project Summary (Dec 20, 2025)\n\nToday's development focused on enhancing the security and resilience of the Optimism network with new pull requests addressing denial-of-service prevention and peer-to-peer network stability, alongside internal code cleanup in `op-geth`. A new issue was reported concerning an `eth_simulatev1` error post-Jovian fork, indicating a potential problem with deposit transaction handling.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [`ethereum-optimism/op-geth#739`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/739): An `eth_simulatev1` error is occurring after the Jovian fork, reporting \"missing deposit transaction,\" which needs investigation.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Codebase Refinement**:\n    - Internal cleanup in `op-geth` by removing the `storedReceiptsRLP` struct to streamline core data accessors and types, superseding a previous pull request. [`ethereum-optimism/op-geth#738`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/738)\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**:\n    - **ethereum-optimism/optimism**:\n        - Add request body size limit to `op-up` to prevent Denial-of-Service attacks. [`ethereum-optimism/optimism#18665`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18665)\n        - Improve static peer resilience in the p2p network by implementing individual exponential backoff monitors. [`ethereum-optimism/optimism#18664`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18664)\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n- **New Issues**:\n    - **ethereum-optimism/op-geth**:\n        - `eth_simulatev1` error after Jovian fork: \"error calculating DA footprint: missing deposit transaction\". [`ethereum-optimism/op-geth#739`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/739)"
