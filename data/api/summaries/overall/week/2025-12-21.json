  "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week, development focused on strengthening the core protocol by advancing the next generation of our fault-proof system and completing a key feature for `op-node` light clients. This architectural work improves security and decentralization, while parallel efforts in operations and tooling laid the groundwork for the upcoming Upgrade 18 and enhanced the reliability of the developer pipeline.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening Protocol Security and Decentralization**\n_Goal: To enhance the security of the OP Stack's fault-proof mechanism and increase the flexibility of nodes participating in the network._\n-   A major architectural upgrade to the fault-proof system is underway, with work in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) to integrate the `op-supernode` into the challenger. This is a key step toward replacing the older `op-supervisor` component with a more robust solution.\n-   A significant milestone was reached with the completion of a feature allowing `op-node` light clients to follow external data sources, a crucial capability for improving node flexibility and decentralization across the Superchain. This was tracked across multiple repositories, including [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).\n-   To increase the reliability of critical administrative actions, a safety check was added in [ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops) to prevent multisig transactions from failing due to insufficient gas.\n-   A critical deployment blocker was identified in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) where core contracts exceed the maximum size limit, highlighting a priority for resolution to support new chain deployments.\n\n**Preparing for Future Superchain Upgrades**\n_Goal: To ensure a smooth and secure rollout of new features and standards across the Superchain ecosystem._\n-   Preparations for the upcoming Upgrade 18 are in full swing, with foundational templates, tests, and deployment tasks being integrated in [ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops).\n-   A new release candidate version (`v6.0.0-rc.1`) was introduced in the [ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry), signaling progress toward the next iteration of Superchain standards.\n-   The `op-deployer` and `op-validator` tools were upgraded to v6.0.0 in [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism), equipping developers with the latest validation tests.\n\n**Improving Infrastructure and Developer Experience**\n_Goal: To make building on and contributing to Optimism faster, easier, and more reliable._\n-   Work continued on unifying our development infrastructure by migrating Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions across repositories like [ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra), [ethereum-optimism/op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth), and [ethereum-optimism/ecosystem](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem).\n-   The reliability of the `proxyd` service was enhanced in [ethereum-optimism/infra](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra) with the addition of graceful shutdown and healthcheck functionalities.\n-   Documentation was improved in [ethereum-optimism/docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs) with an updated guide for the permissionless switch, a refresh of branding assets, and updates to reflect the latest chain architecture.\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n**Advancing the Fault-Proof System**\nA coordinated effort is underway to modernize the fault-proof system. The core implementation work to replace `op-supervisor` with `op-supernode` is happening in `ethereum-optimism/optimism`. This change is being supported by updates to the formal specifications in `ethereum-optimism/specs` and documentation in `ethereum-optimism/docs`. Across nearly all technical repositories, discussions are active to validate the correctness of the `op-challenger` component, ensuring its behavior is reliable before the architectural transition is complete.\n\n**Completing the `op-node` Light Client Feature**\nThe completion of the `op-node` feature allowing it to follow external data sources ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18317)) was a milestone tracked and confirmed across numerous repositories, including `optimism`, `op-geth`, `specs`, and `superchain-registry`. This indicates a successful, project-wide push to implement, test, and finalize a key piece of protocol functionality that benefits the entire Superchain.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### ethereum-optimism/optimism\n-   Advanced the deprecation of `op-supervisor` by implementing a new super root provider for `op-supernode` in the challenger system ([#18653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18653)).\n-   Released v6.0.0 of the `op-deployer` and `op-validator` tools, incorporating new validation tests ([#18662](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18662)).\n-   Completed the `op-node` Light CL \"Follow External Source\" feature ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18317)), allowing nodes to mirror external data feeds.\n-   Identified a critical bug where `op-contracts` deployment fails due to the 24KB contract size limit, a potential blocker for new chains ([#18685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/18685)).\n-   Fixed a port collision bug in acceptance tests ([#18684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18684)) and a compatibility issue for `op-preimage` on Windows ([#18687](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18687)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops\n-   Made significant progress preparing for Upgrade 18 by integrating new templates, regression tests ([#1313](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1313)), and specific tasks for the betanet deployment ([#1319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1319)).\n-   Enhanced multisig reliability by merging a feature that reverts tasks with insufficient gas, preventing transaction failures ([#1277](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1277)).\n-   Corrected the `simulate-l2-ownership-transfer.md` guide to improve accuracy for developers ([#1291](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-ops/pull/1291)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/infra\n-   Improved `proxyd` reliability by introducing a graceful server shutdown mechanism ([#533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/533)) and adding healthcheck and drain functionality ([#534](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/534)).\n-   Advanced the effort to streamline CI/CD processes with a pull request to complete the migration of Docker builds to GitHub Actions ([#532](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/532)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/docs\n-   Updated the chain architecture documentation to incorporate `op-challenger` and reflect the removal of `op-supervisor` ([#1763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1763)).\n-   Improved the permissionless switch guide for chain operators with more accurate information ([#1920](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1920)).\n-   Completed a project-wide refresh of branding assets, including new favicons and logos ([#1929](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1929)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/specs\n-   Updated the dispute game interface specifications to align with the current implementation, ensuring documentation remains accurate for developers ([#871](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/871)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry\n-   Prepared for an upcoming release by adding a new standard version, `v6.0.0-rc.1`, for mainnet and Sepolia ([#1187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1187)).\n-   Performed CI maintenance to align `circleci-utils` with the main Optimism repository, ensuring pipeline stability ([#1188](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/1188)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/ecosystem\n-   Initiated work to complete the migration of Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions, aiming to consolidate the CI pipeline ([#972](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem/pull/972)).\n\n### ethereum-optimism/op-geth\n-   Continued the project-wide effort to streamline CI/CD by opening a PR to finalize the migration of Docker builds to GitHub Actions ([#740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/740))."
