# ethereum-optimism/specs Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
June was characterized by a dual focus on advancing Superchain interoperability specifications and significantly improving developer tooling and CI/CD processes. Key progress was made in refining `op-supervisor` behavior, particularly around reset logic and L1 origin validity. A major effort culminated in the closure of numerous issues related to Superchain-Ops tooling, streamlining task management and deployment. Concurrently, the team tackled system stability by investigating `op-batcher` memory consumption, `op-geth` CPU performance, and CI test flakiness, leading to the release of a test flake report generator.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month's merged changes focused on hardening and clarifying core specifications for interoperability and fault proofs.

*   **Interop and Supervisor Specification Refinements:** To improve the clarity and robustness of the Superchain's interoperability layer, several documentation updates were merged. The `op-supervisor` documentation was enhanced to clarify the concept of a "managed node" (#732), and new constraints were added for the `supervisor_syncStatus` RPC method to ensure implementation consistency (#723). Additionally, a bug was fixed that was causing event descriptions to be reset in the `managed-mode.md` specification file (#719).

*   **Fault Proof Documentation:** To keep specifications aligned with implementation, the documentation for Fault Proof Virtual Machines was updated. "Cannon" is now correctly listed as 64-bit, and "cannon-rs" has been marked as deprecated (#720).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The month saw the resolution of major initiatives around tooling and testing, while new investigations were launched into component performance and supervisor stability.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Superchain-Ops Tooling Overhaul:** A massive effort to enhance the Superchain-Ops tooling concluded, with dozens of issues closed. This project delivered automated CI task execution (#337), improved support for stacked proposals (#342), better developer experience through mainnet examples (#651) and markdown-formatted state diffs (#777), and enhanced validation checks against `StandardValidator` contracts (#838).
    *   **CI/CD and Testing Stability:** A major focus on reliability led to the closure of investigations into CI flakiness (#16271) and a spike on CI SLAs (#16437). While formal SLAs were not adopted, the effort resulted in a new test flake report generator and a commitment to continuous monitoring.
    *   **Flashblocks Integration:** Significant progress was marked by the closure of issues for enabling flashblocks on the `eris-0` environment (#16468) and completing the corresponding acceptance tests (#354).
    *   **Developer Environment & Documentation:** Several quality-of-life improvements were completed, including enabling the modification of predeploys in local environments (#393) and closing documentation issues related to ERC-20 bridging (#1508) and the deprecated `L2OutputOracleProxy` (#1614).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **`op-supervisor` Stability:** A primary area of active investigation involves the `op-supervisor`. Discussions are ongoing to improve L1 origin validity checks during resets (#16315), handle event overflows during large sync gaps (#16335), and debug event spikes that may indicate deadlocks (#16603). This work is critical for the robustness of the Superchain's managed node infrastructure.
    *   **Component Performance Optimization:** New issues were opened to investigate and optimize performance bottlenecks. This includes a spike to reduce `op-batcher` memory consumption during L1 congestion (#16537), which has already yielded detailed profiling analysis, and an ongoing community-driven effort to debug abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` (#613).
    *   **Future Work & Specification Gaps:** New issues have laid the groundwork for future development, including research into embedding `op-node` within `op-supervisor` to deprecate the managed mode RPC API (#734), adding missing Super DA error codes to the spec (#725), and creating a Gas Tank contract (#836).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
June saw deep technical collaboration on critical performance issues. The investigation into `op-batcher` memory consumption (#16537) was a prime example, with detailed `pprof` analysis and optimization suggestions shared between developers. The discussion around CI SLAs (#16437) showcased healthy internal debate, with multiple team members contributing diverse perspectives to shape the team's approach to CI reliability. Community members also actively participated in debugging, as seen in the `op-geth` abnormal CPU usage issue (#613), where users shared performance profiles and troubleshooting steps. Finally, the large-scale closure of Superchain-Ops tooling issues suggests the successful completion of a major, coordinated project involving multiple contributors.
