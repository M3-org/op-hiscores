# ethereum-optimism/specs Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of focused refinement and foundational work for the OP Stack. Development centered on enhancing the Superchain's interoperability specifications, with key updates to improve cross-chain block referencing and API clarity. Significant progress was made in deploying and monitoring infrastructure for flashblocks on op-sepolia, as evidenced by the closure of several related tracking issues. Alongside these infrastructure advancements, the team dedicated substantial effort to documentation hygiene, specification cleanup, and laying the groundwork for future protocol upgrades like the `min-base-fee` specification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on improving the clarity, accuracy, and robustness of the core specifications.

- **Interoperability & Superchain Specification Refinements:**
  - Enhancements were made to improve cross-chain operations, including adding `DerivationCurrentL1Update` and extending `interop_blockRefByNumber` to better track the L1 origin of L2 blocks ([#733](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/733), [#735](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/735)).
  - The Supervisor API specification was updated to clarify how null block references are handled, ensuring more robust interactions ([#739](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/739)).
  - Terminology was aligned by explicitly stating that the `unsafe` safety level corresponds to `local-unsafe`, resolving an inconsistency between the specification and implementation ([#722](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/722)).

- **Documentation & Repository Maintenance:**
  - A major effort to improve documentation structure began with a pull request to centralize all RPC specifications ([#736](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/736)).
  - Numerous small but important fixes were merged to correct broken links, typos, and grammatical errors across the documentation ([#716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/716), [#721](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/721), [#740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/740)).
  - The specification was cleaned up by removing the deprecated custom gas token feature ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/689]).
  - Repository management was streamlined by removing the `CODEOWNERS` file to simplify the review process ([#743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/743)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The month saw a significant cleanup of the issue tracker, with many older issues being closed, alongside the creation of new issues to scope out future work.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks Deployment:** Several issues related to the deployment and configuration of flashblocks on op-sepolia were closed, including tasks for enabling flashblocks, deploying a websocket-proxy, and configuring the RPC ([#16544](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16544), [#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16496), [#16686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16686)).
  - **Specification & Terminology Alignment:** Issues concerning the `interop_ready` RPC and inconsistencies in safety level terminology (`Unsafe` vs. `LocalUnsafe`) were resolved ([#714](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/714), [#717](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/717)).
  - **Backlog Cleanup:** A number of older issues related to sequencer stability, outdated packages, and node startup problems were closed to clear the backlog ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/11228), [#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/12240), [#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/13459)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Future Protocol Features:** New issues were created to formally specify the `SuperchainConfig` type ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/741)) and the `min-base-fee` mechanism ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/742)), signaling the start of work on these important upgrades. The "Min Base Fee" tracking issue ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16807)) saw active discussion and coordination of work across multiple repositories.
  - **Testing and Monitoring:** There were detailed discussions on improving testing infrastructure, including developing a sync tester service ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16452)), creating an E2E test for invalid transaction reinjection ([#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16656)), and establishing comprehensive monitoring and alerting for flashblocks ([#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16388)).
  - **Ecosystem Tooling:** An active issue tracks the migration from Etherscan to Blockscout for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia, a key change for the user-facing ecosystem ([#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1696)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. For example, the design of session management for the `op-sync-tester` ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16452)) and the review process for `VerifyOPCM` ([#16653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16653)) involved multiple contributors sharing proposals and feedback. There were also signs of community engagement, with contributors expressing interest in taking on tasks like adding a spelling lint ([#680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/680)) and collaborating on a design document for transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/306)). The concerted effort to close stale issues indicates active maintenance and a healthy triage process within the core team.
