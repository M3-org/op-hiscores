# ethereum-optimism/specs Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
August was a month of significant progress in formalizing core protocol features for the upcoming Jovian release and enhancing the Superchain's interoperability framework. Key achievements include integrating the minimum base fee design into the official specifications, introducing a comprehensive specification for the Flashblocks preconfirmation system, and completing a major milestone in proofs interoperability acceptance testing. Discussions also advanced on strategic architectural decisions, such as the migration of `op-deployer` to Forge and a potential redesign of the P2P sync mechanism in `op-node`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on translating design documents into concrete specifications and improving the systems that ensure cross-chain reliability.

*   **Jovian Release Specifications:**
    *   The design for the minimum base fee was formally converted into specifications for the Jovian release, defining economic parameters in `exec-engine.md`, `overview.md`, and `system-config.md` ([#747]).
    *   The U16a specification was introduced, updating `OptimismPortal` and `SystemConfig` to streamline future feature additions ([#750]).
    *   A proposal for the Jovian Data Availability (DA) Footprint was opened ([#748]).

*   **Protocol & Feature Enhancements:**
    *   A detailed specification for Flashblocks, an out-of-protocol system for rapid preconfirmations, was added to the protocol documentation ([#754]).
    *   New proposals were opened to add specifications for block calldata limits ([#746]), custom gas tokens ([#749]), a `LivenessModule` ([#751]), and a `TimelockGuard` ([#752]).
    *   Minor cleanups were made to the Optimism Portal specifications to better align the documentation with the existing code ([#745]).

*   **Supervisor & Interoperability Improvements:**
    *   The managed node specification was enhanced with a new `resetPreInterop` method ([#744]).
    *   A `supervisor_localSafe` feature was added to the interop specifications, improving the supervisor's capabilities ([#753]).
    *   Supervisor data availability and RPC error codes were refactored and linked for better clarity and navigation ([#724], [#685]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in August focused on finalizing specifications, completing testing milestones, and initiating discussions on major future work.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Specification & Feature Completion:** The issue to write the `min-base-fee` specification was closed, marking the completion of this critical task ([#742]). The implementation of Flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers was confirmed, closing the related tracking issue ([#16688]).
    *   **Testing Infrastructure:** A significant milestone was reached with the closure of the umbrella issue for "proofs: Interop Acceptance Testing" ([#15946]) and its sub-task for `op-challenger` tests ([#15948]).
    *   **Strategic Deprecation:** Issues related to adding Flashblocks support in Kurtosis ([#16514]) and `op-up` support for the challenger ([#17005]) were closed, reflecting a strategic decision to prioritize other testing backends like Sysgo and Docker.
    *   **Cleanup:** Several issues were closed as part of ongoing maintenance, including the removal of two events from the event system ([#17001]) and the decision not to implement consensus-influencing event nonces for Jovian ([#13543]).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **`op-deployer` to Forge Migration:** A major new initiative to migrate `op-deployer` to use Forge gained significant traction. A central tracking issue ([#17213]) was created, along with several sub-tasks for converting specific components ([#17214], [#17215], [#17216], [#17217], [#17218]), which saw active community interest.
    *   **P2P Sync Architecture:** A critical discussion continued around deprecating the `req-resp` P2P sync in `op-node` ([#14108]). A detailed alternative was proposed, suggesting a move towards a more robust and simpler system using gossiped blocks and a centralized driver.
    *   **Flashblocks Operationalization:** With Flashblocks now live, discussions turned to operational readiness, including requests for a detailed load testing report ([#16756]) and the implementation of sequencer alerting ([#16867], [#16868]).
    *   **Sync Testing Expansion:** Ideas were proposed to enhance OP Stack sync testing by covering all hard fork transitions and incorporating multiple consensus layer clients ([#16703]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was strong this month, highlighted by cross-team efforts and active community participation in new initiatives. The discussion around the `min-base-fee` specification involved feedback and related work across multiple repositories, including `reth` and `op-alloy` ([#16807]). The resolution of a RetroPGF project flagging issue ([#72]) demonstrated responsiveness to community feedback. Most notably, the new effort to migrate `op-deployer` to Forge saw immediate engagement, with contributor `tooshiNoko` volunteering to take on multiple core tasks, signaling healthy interest in contributing to the project's tooling evolution.
