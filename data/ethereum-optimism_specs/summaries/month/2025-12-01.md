# ethereum-optimism/specs Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Development in December focused on refining core protocol specifications and making key architectural decisions. Progress was made on formalizing the Superchain's configuration by introducing a `SuperchainDefinition` type, and the derivation specification was updated. A significant decision was made to integrate ZK game challenging directly within `op-challenger`. Concurrently, active discussions addressed node stability issues and improvements to the development and testing infrastructure, highlighting a focus on both future-proofing the protocol and ensuring the reliability of the current network.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on enhancing the clarity and completeness of the protocol specifications.

- **Protocol Specification Refinements:** The derivation specification was updated with the merge of PR [#866](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/866), clarifying a key component of the protocol. Work also began on formalizing the configuration of the Superchain with the introduction of PR [#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/867), which proposes adding a `SuperchainDefinition` type to the spec. This effort aims to create a more structured and verifiable definition for chains within the Superchain ecosystem.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month led to a key strategic decision and highlighted ongoing efforts to improve network reliability and testing capabilities.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - A major decision was reached in [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18322) regarding the strategy for ZK games. The project will move forward with supporting ZK game challenging within the existing `op-challenger`, rather than building a separate succinct challenger.
    - A minor documentation UI issue ([#1752](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1752)) was closed, with the fix anticipated as part of a future framework update.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Node Stability:** A critical discussion is ongoing in [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18510) concerning `op-node` synchronization failures. Maintainers are actively debugging the issue and have suggested upgrading `op-geth` as a potential mitigation.
    - **Test Infrastructure:** Discussions are underway to enhance testing. Issue [#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18482) proposes a new `op-spammer` component for devnets, though the conversation points towards leveraging existing tools from other projects like `flashbots/contender`. Additionally, follow-up occurred on [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16450) regarding the need for `sysgo` to support flashblocks for acceptance tests.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both specification development and issue triage. The creation of PR [#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/867) was a direct result of feedback and discussion in issue [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/741), demonstrating a healthy feedback loop. Contributor `geoknee` was notably active, guiding discussions across multiple technical issues related to node stability ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18510)) and testing infrastructure ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18482), [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16450)), indicating a strong maintainer presence in triaging and problem-solving.
