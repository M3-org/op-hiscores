# ethereum-optimism/specs Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December's efforts centered on refining core protocol specifications and addressing network operational challenges. A key strategic decision was made to integrate ZK game challenging directly into `op-challenger`, setting a clear direction for future fault-proof development. Work progressed on formalizing Superchain configurations with the introduction of a new `SuperchainDefinition` type. Concurrently, active discussions focused on improving network stability by investigating `op-node` synchronization issues and potential bugs in the sequencer's recovery mode.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Development work this month focused on enhancing the clarity and robustness of the OP Stack specifications.

- **Protocol Specification Refinements:**
  - To ensure predictable protocol behavior, the specification was updated to explicitly define that malformed system configuration updates are "skipped" ([#868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/868)).
  - The derivation specification document, `derivation.md`, was updated to keep the documentation current with protocol logic ([#866](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/866)).

- **Superchain Configuration:**
  - A pull request was opened to add the `SuperchainDefinition` type to the `superchain-config` specification ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/867)). This is a foundational step toward standardizing the configuration and interoperability of chains within the Superchain ecosystem.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue tracking this month was characterized by a major architectural decision and a focus on node stability and developer tooling.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - A significant decision was reached in [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18322) to support ZK games within the existing `op-challenger` component, resolving a key architectural question about the project's approach to ZK fault proofs.
  - A minor documentation UI issue related to theme visibility was closed ([#1752](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1752)), with the resolution planned as part of a future framework upgrade.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Node Stability:** Several active issues highlight a focus on network robustness. Discussions in [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18510) are aimed at diagnosing `op-node` synchronization failures, while [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18350) investigates a potential bug in the sequencer's recovery mode that could cause it to stall.
  - **Developer Tooling:** A proposal to create a new `op-spammer` component for devnets ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18482)) led to a discussion about leveraging existing tools from the ecosystem, such as `flashbots/contender`, to avoid redundant effort.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions within issues. The resolution of the ZK game challenging strategy ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18322)) demonstrated a healthy process of debate leading to a decisive technical direction. In issue [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/741), feedback from one contributor was directly incorporated into a new pull request ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/867)), showcasing an effective review and iteration cycle. Furthermore, discussions around developer tooling ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18482)) showed a collaborative effort to survey existing community tools before building new ones.
