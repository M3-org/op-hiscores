# ethereum-optimism/specs Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of focused refinement and housekeeping for the Optimism specifications. Key efforts centered on enhancing protocol robustness by clarifying the Fusaka defense mechanism and updating the Jovian upgrade's Data Availability (DA) footprint limit specifications. The formal closure of the Isthmus Upgrade tracker marked a significant milestone, while progress was made in evolving the project's testing strategy. A notable challenge remains with a Go 1.25 compatibility issue affecting Cannon, which is currently blocking further work pending an upstream fix.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month concentrated on refining existing specifications for upcoming upgrades and enhancing protocol security.

- **Jovian Upgrade Specifications:** The specifications for the Jovian upgrade's DA footprint limit were updated. A key change in [#800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/800) was to utilize `blobGasUsed` for the new gas-like dimension, avoiding modifications to the existing `gasUsed` field. This work also corrected the storage location for the DA footprint gas scalar. In preparation for the upgrade, a separate pull request ([#799](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/799)) was opened to regenerate the Jovian upgrade transactions.

- **Protocol Security Enhancements:** To improve the protocol's security and robustness, work began on clarifying the specifications for the Fusaka defense mechanism ([#790](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/790)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on closing out completed work and tracking significant ongoing challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Isthmus Upgrade Completion:** The tracker for the Isthmus Upgrade ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/12703)) was officially closed, confirming the successful completion of this major network upgrade.
    - **Specification & Test Refinements:** Several issues were resolved, including an update to the DA footprint block limit specification ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/792)), an improvement to test reporting in `op-acceptor` ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/386)), and the closure of an investigation into L2 Execution Layer syncing conditions ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17628)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility Blocker:** A significant blocker is being tracked in [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17060), where a Go 1.25 compatibility issue is causing incorrect Keccak hashes in Cannon. The problem is dependent on an upstream MIPS fix in the Go toolchain, which was not included in the Go 1.25.1 release.
    - **Shift in `op-reth` Integration Strategy:** Discussion in [#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17475) indicates a strategic shift for testing `op-reth`. With the Kurtosis devnet being deprecated, the focus is now on integrating `op-reth` into the `devstack` / `sysgo` system.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Based on the available reports, development activity in October was focused and methodical. The work reflects a clear effort to finalize major past upgrades like Isthmus while carefully preparing specifications for future ones like Jovian. The ongoing discussions around the Cannon compatibility issue and `op-reth` integration highlight the team's proactive approach to resolving technical blockers and adapting testing infrastructure.
