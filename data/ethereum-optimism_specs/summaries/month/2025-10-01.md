# ethereum-optimism/specs Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's efforts focused on solidifying the protocol by concluding past upgrades and initiating new security enhancements. A significant milestone was achieved with the formal closure of the Isthmus Upgrade tracker, marking its successful completion. Concurrently, work began on refining the Fusaka defense mechanism specifications to improve protocol robustness. However, development faces a notable blocker with a Go 1.25 compatibility issue affecting Cannon's cryptographic functions, while testing strategy continues to evolve with a planned integration of `op-reth` into the `devstack` system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month's development centered on enhancing the security and clarity of the core protocol specifications.

*   **Protocol Security Enhancements:** To improve the protocol's robustness, work has begun on clarifying the specifications for the Fusaka defense mechanism. A pull request ([#790](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/790)) was opened to formalize these enhancements.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month involved closing out major upgrade tasks and identifying a critical external dependency blocker.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Isthmus Upgrade Completion:** The primary tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/12703)) was closed, confirming the successful conclusion of this major network upgrade.
    *   **Housekeeping and Refinements:** Several issues were resolved, including an improvement to test reporting in `op-acceptor` HTML output ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/386)) and the closure of an investigation into L2 Execution Layer syncing conditions ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17628)), which was deemed a non-critical concern.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility Blocker:** A significant challenge is being tracked in [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17060), where a bug in the Go 1.25 toolchain causes incorrect Keccak hashes in Cannon. This is a blocking issue for tooling that relies on these cryptographic operations, and a fix was not present in the Go 1.25.1 release.
    *   **`op-reth` Testing Strategy:** Discussion in [#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17475) signals a strategic shift in testing infrastructure. With the Kurtosis devnet being deprecated, the focus is now on integrating `op-reth` with the `devstack` / `sysgo` system for future testing.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Discussions this month were focused and impactful, centering on resolving critical technical challenges and finalizing strategic decisions. The active conversations around the Cannon compatibility issue ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17060)) and the evolving `op-reth` testing strategy ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17475)) highlight the community's engagement in tackling key blockers and shaping the project's future development path. The closure of the Isthmus Upgrade tracker also reflects a collaborative effort to confirm the successful rollout and completion of a major initiative.
