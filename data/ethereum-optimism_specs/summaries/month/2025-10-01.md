# ethereum-optimism/specs Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of focused specification refinement and technical housekeeping. Key progress was made in clarifying protocol mechanisms, with updates to the Fusaka defense mechanism and the Jovian upgrade's Data Availability (DA) footprint limit. The team also formally concluded the Isthmus Upgrade by closing its tracking issue. A significant ongoing challenge is a Go 1.25 compatibility issue impacting Cannon, which remains a blocker pending a fix in the Go toolchain.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on enhancing the clarity and correctness of protocol specifications for upcoming and existing features.

- **Jovian Upgrade Specifications:**
  - The specifications for the DA footprint limit were updated to use `blobGasUsed` instead of modifying the `gasUsed` field. This change, implemented in [#800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/800), also corrected the storage location for the DA footprint gas scalar.
  - In support of these changes, a pull request was opened to regenerate the Jovian upgrade transactions ([#799](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/799)).

- **Protocol Security Refinements:**
  - To enhance protocol robustness, the specifications for the Fusaka defense mechanism were clarified in a new pull request ([#790](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/790)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on closing out completed work and tracking significant external blockers.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Upgrade Completion:** The tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/12703)) was closed, marking the successful completion of the upgrade.
  - **Specification & Testing:** An issue regarding the DA footprint block limit specification ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/792)) was resolved by the implementation in PR [#800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/800). Additionally, issues related to `op-acceptor` test reporting ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/386)) and L2 Execution Layer syncing conditions ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17628)) were closed.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Cannon Go Compatibility Blocker:** A critical issue ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17060)) persists where Go 1.25 causes incorrect Keccak hashes in Cannon. This is a significant blocker for fault-proof components, and the required MIPS fix was not included in the Go 1.25.1 release.
  - **Testing Strategy Shift:** An ongoing discussion ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17475)) highlights a strategic pivot for testing `op-reth`. With the Kurtosis devnet deprecated, the focus is now on integrating `op-reth` into the `devstack` / `sysgo` system.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Development activity this month demonstrated methodical coordination, with specification pull requests directly addressing and closing their corresponding design issues. Discussions on active issues show the team is proactively tracking external dependencies, such as the Go toolchain, and adapting internal strategies, like the testing approach for `op-reth`, in response to changes in the ecosystem.
