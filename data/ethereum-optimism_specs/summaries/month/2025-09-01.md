# ethereum-optimism/specs Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September was a month of significant refinement and consolidation for the Optimism specifications. Major progress was made in finalizing the Jovian protocol upgrade, with key clarifications on `MinBaseFee` requirements and the addition of data availability footprint limits. The team successfully rolled out flashblocks on mainnet sequencers, closing numerous issues related to deployment, monitoring, and load testing. A critical `op-geth` bug causing receipt decoding failures was swiftly identified and resolved. Concurrently, a substantial effort was made to clean up the issue backlog, closing out a large volume of older tasks related to deprecated Kurtosis tooling and a previous superchain-ops architecture, signaling a clear focus on current priorities and improved development workflows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on hardening upcoming protocol upgrades, improving developer tooling, and ensuring documentation accuracy.

-   **Jovian Protocol Specification Hardening:**
    -   The specifications were updated to explicitly require `PayloadAttributes.MinBaseFee` to be `NULL` prior to the Jovian upgrade, clarifying protocol behavior ([#756]).
    -   Specifications for data availability (DA) footprint limits were added to the Jovian protocol documentation ([#767]).
    -   The `SystemConfig.ConfigUpdate` event specification was refined to improve naming and remove redundancy ([#763]).
    -   Precision was added to the L1 block attribute transaction choice for the activation blocks of both the Isthmus and Jovian upgrades ([#789]).

-   **Upgrade Tooling and Automation:**
    -   New scripts and improvements were introduced to streamline the generation of specifications for upgrade and proxy update transactions, simplifying the process for future hardforks ([#673], [#780]).

-   **Documentation and Specification Fixes:**
    -   A bug related to flashblocks authorship was corrected in the protocol specifications ([#775]).
    -   Various documentation improvements were made, including fixing broken links in configurability docs ([#765]), adding detail to system configuration specs ([#766]), and correcting minor typos ([#768], [#774]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The month saw a major cleanup of the issue tracker, resolving long-standing items and addressing critical new bugs, while also initiating discussions on future protocol enhancements.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Flashblocks Rollout:** A suite of issues related to the deployment, monitoring, health checks, and load testing of flashblocks and `rollup-boost` on mainnet were successfully closed, marking the completion of this initiative ([#16759], [#16760], [#16868], [#17317], [#16756], [#17462]).
    -   **`op-geth` Bug Fixes:** A critical issue causing `op-geth` to crash due to "Failed to decode RLP receipts" was reported and resolved ([#679]). An older issue regarding `op-geth` initialization with large genesis files was also closed with a recommended solution ([#668]).
    -   **Infrastructure & Tooling Deprecation:** A large number of issues related to the Kurtosis development environment were closed, reflecting a strategic shift to other local development tools ([#158], [#14390], [#15753], etc.). Similarly, many issues tied to the old `superchain-ops` architecture and CI processes were closed, reflecting a move to a new, more streamlined workflow ([#49], [#12], [#427], [#433]).
    -   **Testing Cleanup:** Several obsolete smoke test issues for components like `op-challenger` and `op-proposer` were closed as they are no longer required ([#140], [#141], [#142], [#143]).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Future Protocol Design:** Important new discussions were initiated around standardizing network upgrade transactions to avoid potential address collisions ([#781]), proposing the use of SSZ `hash_tree_root` for `SequencerCommitment` signatures ([#787]), and ensuring forward-compatibility for clients parsing `SystemConfig.ConfigUpdate` events ([#777]).
    -   **Test Stability:** The flakiness of `TestPreNoInbox` in `op-acceptance-tests` remains an active concern, with previous fix attempts proving unsuccessful ([#17298]).
    -   **Synchronization Logic:** An active discussion is underway regarding the precise synchronization conditions between the L2 Consensus Layer (CL) and Execution Layer (EL), particularly for `op-geth` ([#17628]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was strong this month, characterized by rapid responses to critical issues and deep technical discussions on protocol design. The resolution of the `op-geth` receipt decoding bug ([#679]) demonstrated an effective feedback loop, with community member `@cpuchainorg` reporting the issue and later confirming the fix.

Discussions on future protocol changes, such as standardizing network upgrade transactions ([#781]), saw detailed analysis from core contributors like `@protolambda`, showcasing in-depth engagement on foundational architecture. Furthermore, a snag report on the new `superchain-ops` flow ([#1224]) from `@geoknee` was quickly acknowledged by `@blmalone`, leading to immediate pull requests to improve the user experience. This highlights a healthy cycle of user feedback and iterative improvement within the contributor community.
