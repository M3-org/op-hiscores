# ethereum-optimism/specs Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
November was a period of significant documentation and specification refinement for the Optimism protocol. A major effort was dedicated to formalizing core components by introducing comprehensive new specifications for the `GovernanceToken`, `MIPS64`, and the `FaultDisputeGame`. Alongside this new work, there was a concerted push to improve the quality, clarity, and structure of existing experimental contract specifications. This focus on documentation extended to upcoming protocol changes, with key details for the Jovian hard fork being specified. Concurrently, active discussions centered on enhancing the robustness of core infrastructure, including `op-batcher` configuration and `Proxyd` synchronization.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on creating a more robust and navigable specification set, formalizing both existing and future protocol components.

- **New Core Component Specifications:** The repository saw the addition of several crucial specifications, laying the groundwork for better understanding and implementation of key protocol elements. This included new specs for the `GovernanceToken` ([#848](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/848)), the `MIPS64` virtual machine ([#847](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/847)), and the complete `FaultDisputeGame` family ([#846](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/846), [#852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/852)).

- **Specification Quality and Refinement:** A significant effort was made to improve the quality and consistency of the documentation. This involved a broad cleanup of 31 experimental contract specifications ([#854](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/854)), reorganizing files into a dedicated `/specs` folder ([#851](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/851)), and refining `OptimismPortal` function specs to match the current contract ([#853](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/853)). Readability was further enhanced by linking defined terms to their definitions ([#856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/856)), consolidating duplicates ([#859](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/859)), and adding missing definitions for `MintManager` and `AddressManager` ([#857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/857)).

- **Protocol Configurability and Hard Fork Documentation:** The specifications were updated to reflect evolving protocol standards. Configurability documentation was updated to defer to Superchain registry TOML files as the single source of truth ([#850](https://github.comcom/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/850)). In preparation for the next hard fork, input size restrictions for precompiles introduced in Jovian were formally documented ([#849](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/849)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Discussions this month focused on improving the reliability of core services and preparing for the Jovian hard fork, while several legacy issues were resolved.

- **Closed Issues:** Key resolutions included closing an issue on configurability documentation by deciding to use Superchain registry TOML files as the source of truth ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/770)). An issue regarding unused acceptance tests was closed due to a shift in testing strategy ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16273)), and a flaky test was confirmed to be resolved ([#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17548)).

- **New & Active Issues:** While no new issues were opened, several active discussions pointed to future work:
    - **`Proxyd` Reliability ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/501)):** A significant discussion took place around preventing "backwards time travel" when RPC backends are out of sync. Proposed solutions included a "multicall" strategy, silent fallbacks on errors, and various forms of sticky sessions, highlighting a focus on improving RPC service robustness.
    - **`op-batcher` Enhancements:** Discussions centered on improving `op-batcher` functionality. This included a proposal for a dedicated blob priority fee tracker to improve fee estimation ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18102)) and a conversation about how the batcher should handle its rollup configuration to avoid concurrency issues and make dependencies explicit ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18178)).
    - **Jovian Hard Fork Preparation:** Progress was noted on supporting the Jovian hard fork in the `op-sync-tester` ([#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18126)), and a Go 1.25 compatibility issue affecting Cannon's hash calculations was confirmed to be fixed in a new Go release ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17060)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active issue discussions, where multiple contributors brainstormed and evaluated complex technical solutions. The detailed conversations around `Proxyd` synchronization ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/501)) and `op-batcher` configuration ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18178)) involved multiple team members like `joshklop`, `yashvardhan-kukreja`, and `sebastianst`, showcasing a healthy, collaborative approach to system design. The coordinated efforts to prepare for the Jovian hard fork across different components like Cannon and the sync tester also demonstrate strong cross-team alignment.
