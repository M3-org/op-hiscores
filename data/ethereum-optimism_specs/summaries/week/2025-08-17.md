# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by the successful completion of major testing and implementation milestones, significantly strengthening the protocol's reliability. The team closed the umbrella issue for proofs interop acceptance testing and confirmed the successful rollout of Flashblocks on all Sunnyside sequencers. Alongside these stability wins, work began on future protocol enhancements with a new proposal for custom gas token support. Ongoing refinements to supervisor and managed node specifications underscore a continued focus on improving interoperability within the Superchain ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development efforts focused on both new features and refining existing interoperability specifications.

- **Protocol Feature Enhancement:** A new pull request ([#749](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/749)) was opened to introduce support for custom gas tokens, signaling a move towards greater flexibility in the protocol's economic model.

- **Interop & Node Specification Refinements:** Several changes were made to improve the clarity and functionality of interoperability components.
    - A `resetPreInterop` method was added to the managed node specification to enhance interoperation capabilities ([#744](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/744)).
    - The supervisor specification (`specs/interop/supervisor.md`) was improved by refactoring data availability error codes ([#724](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/724)) and linking RPC error codes for better navigation ([#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/685)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of several significant, long-standing issues, particularly in the realm of testing and protocol implementation.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Proofs Interop Testing Completed:** The umbrella issue for "proofs: Interop Acceptance Testing" ([#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15946)) was closed, marking the completion of all sub-tasks. This includes the finalization of `op-challenger` acceptance tests on interop chains ([#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15948)).
    - **Flashblocks Enabled:** It was confirmed that all Sunnyside sequencers for Sepolia are now running with Flashblocks, successfully closing issue [#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16688).
    - **Cleanup and Deprecation:** The event system was cleaned up with the removal of two events ([#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17001)). An older issue regarding test target setup was closed, noting a strategic shift away from Kurtosis in favor of Sysgo for network testing ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/375)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this week.
    - **Contract Verification Strategy:** A notable discussion on issue [#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/14813) proposed leveraging the `forge verify-contract` command for contract verification. This approach would reduce custom code by shelling out to `forge`'s capabilities for verification against Etherscan and Blockscout.
    - **Documentation and RPC:** Discussions continued on updating an outdated audit page ([#1673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1673)) and an older issue regarding missing content types in RPC responses ([#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/389)) saw renewed interest from a contributor asking how to propose a fix.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in active issue discussions involving multiple contributors. The resolution of the event system cleanup ([#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17001)) highlighted cross-repository coordination, with participants linking to several merged pull requests in the main `optimism` repository. Furthermore, the strategic suggestion on the contract verification issue ([#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/14813)) and a contributor's inquiry about fixing an RPC issue ([#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/389)) demonstrate healthy engagement and proactive problem-solving within the community.
