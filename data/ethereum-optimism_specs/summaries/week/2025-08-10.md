# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Aug 10 - 16, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on specification development and bolstering the project's testing infrastructure. While no new code was merged, significant progress was made in planning for future network upgrades. A key development was the introduction of a pull request for the Jovian release's Data Availability (DA) footprint. Concurrently, discussions around the `min-base-fee` feature led to the creation of a dedicated issue for estimating its state growth. A notable trend was the re-opening of several issues related to testing, indicating a concerted effort to ensure the completeness and robustness of `op-challenger`, `op-sync-tester`, and `op-test-sequencer`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While there were no merged pull requests this week, work began on a significant specification for a future release.

*   **Jovian Release Specification**
    *   A new pull request, [#748](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/748), was opened to define the "DA Footprint" for the upcoming Jovian release. This marks the beginning of formalizing specifications for the next major network upgrade.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The focus this week was on refining existing work and planning for future features, with no issues being closed. Activity was concentrated on creating new targeted issues and revisiting existing ones to ensure all requirements are met.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   No issues were closed this week.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **`min-base-fee` State Growth:** A new issue, [#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/316), was created to formally estimate the state growth impact of the proposed `min-base-fee` feature. This task was spun out of the main specification discussion ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/742)) to ensure the feature's resource implications are thoroughly analyzed.
    *   **Testing Infrastructure Refinements:** A clear theme emerged around improving test coverage and capabilities. Several key issues were re-opened to address outstanding tasks:
        *   **`op-challenger` Acceptance Tests ([#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15948))**: Re-opened to address remaining TODOs for testing dispute resolution on interop chains.
        *   **`op-sync-tester` RPC Support ([#16700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16700))**: Re-opened to track the implementation of test cases for serving `eth` namespace methods.
        *   **`op-test-sequencer` Integration ([#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15265))**: Ongoing discussion highlighted the component's necessity for running reorg tests in the devnet environment.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's activity demonstrates a collaborative process of refinement and due diligence. The re-opening of issues [#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15948) and [#16700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16700) by different team members points to a culture of internal review and a commitment to completing all work items thoroughly. Furthermore, the decision to break out the state growth estimation for `min-base-fee` into a separate issue ([#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/316)) from the main discussion ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/742)) showcases a structured approach to tackling complex feature specifications.
