# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant progress in production infrastructure and a major cleanup of the issue backlog. The team successfully completed the rollout of flashblocks on mainnet sequencers, resolving associated monitoring and health check issues. A large number of issues related to the Kurtosis devnet environment were closed, signaling a strategic deprioritization of that tool. While an older `op-geth` CPU issue was resolved, a new critical bug causing crashes during full sync was identified, posing a significant near-term challenge.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on protocol specification refinement and initiating new security enhancements.

*   **Protocol Specification Refinement:** The specification for the `SystemConfig.ConfigUpdate` event in the Holocene and Jovian protocols was improved by removing repetition and clarifying naming conventions, enhancing the clarity of the protocol documentation ([#763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/763)).
*   **New Security Initiative:** A new proposal, "Safer Safes - Safe Extensions v2" ([#761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/761)), was opened, indicating ongoing work to enhance the security of Safe contracts within the ecosystem.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a substantial reduction in open issues through targeted cleanup efforts, alongside the emergence of a critical new bug.

### Closed Issues
A significant number of issues were resolved, primarily related to infrastructure rollouts and backlog grooming:

*   **Flashblocks Mainnet Enablement:** A series of issues related to the deployment and monitoring of flashblocks on mainnet sequencers were closed, marking the successful completion of this rollout. This included enabling flashblocks on sequencers ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16759), [#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16760), [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17317)) and resolving associated monitoring alerts ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16868)).
*   **Kurtosis Devnet Deprioritization:** A large volume of issues concerning the Kurtosis devnet environment were closed, including those for performance improvements ([#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/14390)), genesis checks ([#15753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15753)), and Websockets support ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17194)). Comments indicate this work is no longer a priority.
*   **Infrastructure & Testing Cleanup:** Numerous older issues were closed as completed or no longer relevant. This included the resolution of an `op-geth` initialization issue with large genesis files ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/668)), the closure of an old `op-geth` CPU usage anomaly ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/613)), and the removal of obsolete smoke test requirements ([#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/140), [#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/141), [#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/142), [#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/143)).
*   **Documentation:** An issue to track funded builder addresses was created and closed after documenting a 64 ETH funding event for the "Titan builder" ([#762](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/762)).

### New & Active Issues
The most significant new issue represents a potential blocker for node operators:

*   **Critical `op-geth` Bug:** A new critical issue, "Failed to decode RLP receipts" ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/679)), was reported for `op-geth` v1.101602.0. This bug causes nodes to crash during a full sync on op-mainnet and is a top priority.
*   **`op-program` Enhancement:** A feature request was opened to add a hint for faster block header oracle lookups in `op-program` ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17416)), with a draft PR already in progress.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in both issue diagnosis and internal process checks. The resolution of the `op-geth` CPU usage issue ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/613)) involved multiple users sharing diagnostics and confirming the fix. The new critical `op-geth` bug ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/679)) was also reported by an external user, highlighting the community's role in maintaining network health. Internally, the reopening of an issue ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17194)) to ensure a `TODO` in the codebase was addressed demonstrates diligent cross-checking among maintainers.
