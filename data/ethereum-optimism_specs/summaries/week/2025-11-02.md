# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push to enhance and formalize the protocol's documentation. Major progress was made with the introduction of comprehensive new specifications for critical components, including the `FaultDisputeGame`, `MIPS64` virtual machine, and `GovernanceToken`. Alongside this expansion, a concerted effort was made to improve the quality, structure, and navigability of existing experimental contract specifications. Concurrently, active discussions on key technical challenges, such as blob priority fee tracking and `proxyd` synchronization, signal a focus on future protocol robustness and efficiency.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this period centered on expanding and refining the core protocol specifications, improving both their breadth and quality.

- **Expansion of Core Protocol Specifications:**
  - New, detailed specifications were introduced for several key system components. This includes the `FaultDisputeGame` and its variants ([#846](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/846), [#852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/852)), the `MIPS64` virtual machine ([#847](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/847)), and the `GovernanceToken` ([#848](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/848)), providing foundational documentation for these crucial parts of the stack.

- **Documentation Quality and Structure:**
  - A series of improvements were merged to enhance the clarity and organization of the specifications. This involved a broad quality pass across 31 experimental contract documents ([#854](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/854)), a cleanup of `OptimismPortal` function specifications to match the current contract ([#853](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/853)), and a structural reorganization of files into a dedicated `/specs` folder ([#851](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/851)).
  - To improve readability, all defined terms within the experimental contract specs were updated to link directly to their definitions ([#856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/856)). A new pull request was also opened to remove unused definitions ([#855](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/855)).

- **Protocol Configuration:**
  - The configurability documentation was updated to defer to the Superchain registry TOML files as the single source of truth for parameters, simplifying configuration management and allowing for future governance-based updates ([#850](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/850)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  - A key issue regarding configuration parameters (`daFootprintGasScalar`, `minBaseFee`) was resolved ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/770)) by the decision to use the Superchain registry TOML files as the canonical source, preventing configuration drift.
  - An issue related to reporting unused acceptance tests ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16273)) was closed, as the team's shift to "gateless mode" made the original requirement obsolete.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were opened during this period.
  - Significant discussion occurred on several active issues, highlighting key areas of ongoing work:
    - **`proxyd` Synchronization ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/501)):** A critical discussion around "backwards time travel" when backends are out of sync led to brainstorming several potential solutions, including a "multicall" strategy and various forms of sticky sessions, indicating a focus on improving RPC reliability.
    - **Blob Priority Fee Tracking ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18102)):** Contributors debated strategies for the batcher to better estimate blob priority fees, with suggestions ranging from considering only the batcher's own transactions to a "decay" model for the starting fee to better handle network congestion.
    - **Flashblocks Support ([#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16450)):** There is active interest in implementing `sysgo` support for flashblocks to aid in validating changes to `kona-node` and `rollup-boost`.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The development activity shows strong, focused collaboration, particularly around the shared goal of improving specifications. The multiple, related PRs aimed at documentation quality suggest a well-coordinated team effort. Furthermore, the detailed technical discussions on active issues like `proxyd` synchronization (#501) and blob fee tracking (#18102) showcase a healthy collaborative environment where team members (including `yashvardhan-kukreja`, `joshklop`, `sebastianst`, and `ajsutton`) are actively brainstorming and evaluating complex technical trade-offs together.
