# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push to enhance the protocol's documentation, with comprehensive specifications added for numerous core, legacy, and experimental contracts. Alongside this documentation effort, critical progress was made in finalizing the Jovian upgrade, including updating transaction bytecode and clarifying genesis block behavior. The team also made strategic decisions to streamline developer tooling and validation processes, notably moving away from Kurtosis and shifting Superchain validation to a report-based system. Active discussions centered on the DA Footprint Limit, Fusaka upgrade preparations, and ensuring compatibility with zk stacks.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on solidifying protocol specifications and preparing for network upgrades.

- **Comprehensive Contract Specification Documentation:** A major effort was undertaken to document the behavior of key contracts within the OP Stack. New specifications were created for the `MintManager` ([#803]), `SafeSend` ([#805]), `LegacyMessagePasser` ([#806]), `AddressManager` ([#809]), and the `L1BlockNumber` predeploy ([#811]). The `FeeVault` specification was also unified to cover all vault types ([#810], [#808], [#807]), and a new spec for the experimental `ResolvedDelegateProxy` was proposed ([#812]).

- **Jovian Upgrade Finalization:** Progress was made toward the Jovian upgrade. A key clarification was merged, confirming the absence of transactions in the genesis blocks for both Jovian and Isthmus protocols ([#801]). Additionally, the Jovian upgrade transactions were updated, finalizing the necessary bytecode ([#804]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving long-standing items related to tooling and validation, while actively investigating blockers for upcoming features.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Jovian Upgrade:** Two issues were closed, finalizing the upgrade's transaction bytecode ([#772]) and settling the `daFootprintGasScalar` default value ([#773]).
    - **Process & Tooling Improvements:** Several issues were closed as part of a strategic shift in tooling. The project is moving away from Kurtosis for local `op-geth` builds ([#16975]) and `interopgen` for e2e tests ([#17614]), favoring acceptance tests instead. The Superchain validation process was also updated to be report-based rather than blocking PRs, closing issues [#689] and [#696].

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened during this period.
    - **DA Footprint Limit:** This feature faces a blocker, as its implementation ([#17551]) is waiting on a related spec derivation issue. An investigation into a bug where the gas scalar was 0 after genesis ([#17946]) has identified the root cause, and a fix is in progress.
    - **Fusaka Upgrade:** Preparations for the Fusaka upgrade are ongoing ([#682], [#1206]), with work on Sepolia complete but the Mainnet merge still pending.
    - **Jovian Marshalling:** An active discussion ([#17907]) is addressing how new fields in `rollupConfig` break zk stacks, with potential solutions being evaluated to maintain interoperability.
    - **Dispute Games:** An issue regarding `OPCMStandardValidator` updates ([#17267]) was reopened, as tests are still being skipped, indicating that the required work is not yet complete.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the coordinated effort to produce a large volume of high-quality documentation for core contracts. Active technical discussions on issues like Jovian marshalling ([#17907]) and the local development environment ([#17942]) highlight the community's focus on cross-stack compatibility and improving the developer experience. The reopening of an issue ([#17267]) after its initial closure demonstrates a collective commitment to thoroughness and ensuring features are fully implemented and tested.
