# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant progress in formalizing core protocol specifications. Key advancements were made for the upcoming Jovian release with the integration of the minimum base fee design. The team also introduced comprehensive specifications for Flashblocks, an out-of-protocol preconfirmation system, and laid the groundwork for future feature flags with the U16a spec. Alongside these specification updates, active discussions continued on major architectural shifts, including the migration of OP Deployer to Forge and a proposal to deprecate the `req-resp` P2P sync mechanism in favor of a more robust alternative.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused heavily on enhancing and formalizing the protocol specifications, preparing for both near-term releases and long-term evolution.

*   **Jovian Release Preparations:** The design for the minimum base fee was formally integrated into the Jovian protocol specifications, a critical step in defining the release's economic model ([#747](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/747)).
*   **Flashblocks Specification:** A detailed specification for Flashblocks, a system for rapid out-of-protocol preconfirmations, was officially added to the documentation, providing clarity on its design and integration ([#754](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/754)).
*   **Future-Proofing the Protocol:** The U16a specification was merged, introducing changes to `OptimismPortal` and `SystemConfig` to streamline the addition of future protocol features ([#750](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/750)).
*   **Superchain Interoperability:** To improve cross-chain functionality, a new `supervisor_localSafe` feature was added to the interop specifications, enhancing the supervisor's capabilities within the Superchain ([#753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/753)).
*   **Upcoming Features:** New proposals were opened for a `LivenessModule` ([#751](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/751)) and a `TimelockGuard` ([#752](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/752)), signaling work on system monitoring and security mechanisms.

## üêõ Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
Several key issues were resolved, marking the completion of specification work and the deprioritization of other tasks.

*   **Specification Finalized:** The tracking issue to formalize the `min-base-fee` design was closed, confirming the completion of this work for the Jovian release ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/742)).
*   **Deprioritized Features:** A number of features were formally deprioritized and their issues closed, including consensus-influencing event nonces for Jovian + Karst ([#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/13543)), Flashblocks support in Kurtosis ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16514)), and distributing the challenger via `op-up` ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17005)).
*   **Operational Cleanup:** Issues related to logging improvements, test log visibility, and a postmortem were closed, clearing out backlog tasks ([#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17007), [#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17151), [#17012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17012)).

### New & Active Issues
Discussions this week centered on significant tooling migrations, architectural changes, and improving system reliability.

*   **OP Deployer Forge Migration:** A major ongoing discussion revolves around migrating OP Deployer to use Forge. A contributor, `tooshiNoko`, showed significant initiative by expressing interest in taking on several related tasks to help drive the effort forward ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17213), [#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17214), [#17215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17215), [#17216](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17216), [#17217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17217), [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17218)).
*   **Deprecation of Req-Resp P2P Sync:** A significant architectural discussion is underway to deprecate the `req-resp` P2P sync in `op-node` ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/14108)). A detailed alternative was proposed that aims to be cheaper, simpler, and faster by using a combination of a centralized gossip driver and EL queries.
*   **Testing and Alerting:** Conversations continued on enhancing system robustness. This includes defining new sync test cases for OP Stack hard forks ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16703)) and refining sequencer alerting for Flashblocks ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16867), [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16868)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The week highlighted strong collaborative momentum, particularly around the proposed migration of OP Deployer to Forge. Contributor `tooshiNoko`'s proactive engagement across multiple issues ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17213) - [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17218)) demonstrated healthy community involvement in a major tooling refactor. Furthermore, the in-depth technical debate on deprecating the `req-resp` P2P sync ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/14108)) showcases a high degree of collaboration among core developers on critical architectural decisions for the future of the OP Stack.
