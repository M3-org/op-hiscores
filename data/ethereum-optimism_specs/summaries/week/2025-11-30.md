# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Nov 30 - 6, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts focused on refining core specifications and making a key architectural decision for future protocol capabilities. Progress was made on formalizing the Superchain's configuration by introducing a `SuperchainDefinition` type. A significant decision was also reached to integrate ZK game challenging directly within the existing `op-challenger`, streamlining the approach to fraud proofs. These developments reflect an ongoing push towards clearer specifications and strategic integration of new technologies.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this period centered on enhancing the clarity and completeness of the project's specifications.

- **Superchain Configuration and Derivation Updates**
  Two pull requests were opened to improve documentation and type definitions. PR [#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/867) introduces the `SuperchainDefinition` type to the `superchain-config` specification, a direct result of discussions in issue [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/741) to better define Superchain configurations. Additionally, PR [#866](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/866) proposes updates to the `derivation.md` document, continuing the effort to refine protocol documentation.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week led to a critical decision on ZK proof integration and advanced the definition of Superchain configurations.

- **Closed Issues:**
  A key strategic decision was finalized with the closure of issue [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18322). After considering alternatives, the project will move forward with supporting ZK games by integrating the challenging logic directly into `op-challenger`.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  No new issues were opened. The primary active discussion occurred in issue [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/741) regarding the `SuperchainConfig` type. This discussion successfully transitioned from planning to implementation with the opening of PR [#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/867).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both the specification development and strategic decision-making processes.

- In issue [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/741), feedback from `emhane` was incorporated by `Himess` before opening the corresponding pull request, demonstrating an effective review cycle.
- The resolution of the ZK game challenging strategy in issue [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18322) involved input from multiple contributors, with `Inphi` noting the feasibility of reimplementing the logic in `op-challenger`, which helped guide the final decision.
