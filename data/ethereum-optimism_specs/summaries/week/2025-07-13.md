# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity was centered on planning, discussion, and issue triage rather than direct code implementation. Significant progress was made in architecting future testing infrastructure, with active discussions on the design of an `op-sync-tester` service and strategies for E2E testing of interop transaction reorgs. The team also engaged in important housekeeping by closing several long-standing issues related to sequencer stability and node setup. While no new features were merged, these foundational discussions and cleanup efforts pave the way for future development and enhance the overall stability and testability of the protocol.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no major features or bug fixes were merged into the `specs` repository this week, a new pull request was opened to improve code quality.

*   **Tooling and Linting:** A pull request ([#738](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/738)) was opened to introduce a spelling lint using `codespell`, aiming to improve the quality and consistency of documentation and code comments.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a significant amount of activity in issue management, with a focus on closing stale issues and advancing discussions on critical testing and protocol design topics.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Housekeeping & Stability:** Several older issues were closed to clean up the tracker. This included two related to sequencer stability and error recovery ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/11228), [#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/12240)), one for an outdated NPM package that is no longer maintained ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/13459)), and a node startup issue assumed to be resolved ([#15411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15411)).
    *   **Resolved Bugs & Test Porting:** An issue concerning nonce errors during transaction approvals was resolved ([#1106](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1106]). Progress was also noted on porting `TestERC20Bridge` to devstack, with the closure of its tracking issue ([#415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/415)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    No new issues were opened this week, but several active discussions signal key areas of future work:
    *   **Testing Infrastructure:** There were detailed architectural discussions around the `op-sync-tester` service, focusing on session management strategies ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16452)). Planning also continued for an E2E test to handle invalid interop transaction reinjection after a block reorg ([#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16656)).
    *   **Interop & Security:** The need for stress testing the interop expiry window was revisited ([#15285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15285)). Additionally, a discussion on deployment verification scripts ([#16653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16653)) highlighted the value of redundancy in ensuring deployment integrity.
    *   **Ecosystem & Code Health:** Work is underway to migrate from Etherscan to Blockscout across repositories ([#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1696]), and progress was reported on porting `TestPectra` to devstack ([#416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/416)). A potential code duplication in `op-batcher` was also identified for future refactoring ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16677)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident through in-depth technical discussions on GitHub issues.
*   Key contributors like `protolambda`, `pcw109550`, `maurelian`, `pauldowman`, and `mds1` were actively involved in shaping the design of future testing tools and security measures.
*   The discussion around the `op-sync-tester` ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16452)) showcased a collaborative design process, with different approaches to session management being proposed and debated.
*   Community engagement was also visible, with contributor `JoshdfG` taking initiative on a spelling lint issue ([#680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/680)), which was quickly followed by a pull request to implement the feature.
