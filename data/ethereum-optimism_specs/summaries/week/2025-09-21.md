# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Sep 21 - 27, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a dual focus on future protocol upgrades and present-day tooling refinement. Significant progress was made in clarifying specifications for the upcoming Isthmus and Jovian upgrades. Concurrently, a substantial housekeeping effort streamlined the project by closing a large volume of outdated issues related to the now-deprecated `superchain-ops` architecture and CI processes. This cleanup aligns the repository with current development practices, while active discussions around improving the new `superchain-ops` workflow demonstrate a commitment to refining user experience based on community feedback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on preparing for future network upgrades and updating core documentation.

- **Protocol Upgrade Specification:** Precision was added to the L1 block attribute transaction choice for the Isthmus and Jovian protocol upgrades. This key clarification, merged in PR [#789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/789), updates the overview, L1 attributes, and system configuration documentation, marking a critical step in preparing for these future hard forks.
- **Derivation Specification Updates:** Several pull requests ([#784](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/784), [#785](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/785)) were opened to update `derivation.md`, indicating ongoing work to refine the core L2 chain derivation logic.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a major effort in issue triage, closing out old tasks and opening new ones focused on protocol enhancements and developer experience.

- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were closed, primarily as part of a large-scale cleanup to reflect architectural changes and process improvements.
    - **Superchain-Ops Architecture Deprecation:** Dozens of issues related to the previous `superchain-ops` architecture were closed, including those for `JsonTxBuilderBase`, `etch` simulation, and older proposal methods ([#12](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/12), [#49](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/49), [#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/140), [#427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/427)). This marks the formal transition to the new, streamlined tooling.
    - **CI & Development Workflow:** Issues concerning CI rate limits, `mise` installation, and test failures with new Foundry versions were resolved ([#569](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/569), [#646](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/646), [#714](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/714)), pointing to a more stable and efficient development environment.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Protocol Enhancement Proposal:** A new issue ([#787](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/787)) proposes using SSZ `hash_tree_root` instead of `keccak(payload)` for `SequencerCommitment` signatures, sparking discussion on a potential improvement to the protocol's signature mechanisms.
    - **Superchain-Ops Workflow Feedback:** An active discussion in [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1224) highlights areas for improvement in the new `superchain-ops` signing flow. User feedback pointed out confusing elements during simulation and signing, leading to immediate action to clarify documentation and tool output.
    - **Potential Bug Fix:** A comment on issue [#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/679), which tracks a Geth crash due to RLP receipt decoding failures, suggests that a recent patch may have resolved this critical bug.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active feedback loop for new tooling. The discussion on issue [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1224) between user `geoknee` and maintainer `blmalone` exemplifies a healthy process of identifying user experience "snags" in the new `superchain-ops` flow and working collaboratively to address them. Additionally, a comment from `cpuchainorg` on issue [#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/679) shows community engagement in verifying fixes for critical network issues. The extensive issue cleanup, largely driven by `blmalone`, demonstrates a strong maintainer effort to improve project hygiene and focus contributor attention on relevant tasks.
