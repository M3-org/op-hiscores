# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Nov 23 - 29, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on a significant protocol enhancement with the introduction of a detailed specification for Custom Gas Token (CGT) support. This foundational work aims to expand the flexibility of the Optimism ecosystem. Concurrently, a critical investigation continued into a potential bug in the sequencer recovery mode that could lead to derivation stalls, highlighting a focus on both new features and core protocol stability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on laying the groundwork for a major new feature and addressing minor documentation issues.

*   **Custom Gas Token (CGT) Specification:** A comprehensive specification for supporting Custom Gas Tokens was introduced ([#749](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/749)). This new feature definition required extensive updates across core protocol components, including bridges, messengers, the Optimism Portal, system configuration, and withdrawal mechanisms, paving the way for greater functional flexibility on the network.
*   **Documentation Fix:** A pull request was opened to fix a broken mermaid diagram in the flashblock documentation ([#864](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/864)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened and no issues were closed this week. However, an important discussion on an active issue continued.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   Discussions progressed on a potential bug within the `op-node` sequencer recovery mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18350)). The issue involves the sequencer requesting an L1 origin block that does not yet exist, causing "not found" errors and preventing the L1 origin from advancing. This behavior could violate the sequencer drift rule and lead to derivation stalls. A potential code fix was proposed, and investigation is ongoing to understand the root cause.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the ongoing technical discussion surrounding the sequencer recovery mode issue ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18350)). The detailed analysis and proposed fix suggest a focused effort to diagnose and resolve a potentially critical protocol bug.
