# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity was focused on planning, process improvement, and specification refinement rather than code implementation. No new code was contributed, but significant discussions took place around defining Continuous Integration (CI) Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to improve pipeline reliability and performance. Efforts to enhance the project's specifications continued, with new issues opened to align the specs with existing implementations by adding missing error codes for Super DA and updating the `ExecutingDescriptor`. Planning for future feature rollouts, such as enabling flashblocks on op-sepolia, also saw progress.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features, bug fixes, or other code changes were merged this week. All development activity was centered on issue creation and discussion for future work.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
### Closed Issues
No issues were closed this week.

### New & Active Issues
The week's focus was on discussion and triage, with several key topics emerging:

*   **Specification Alignment:** Two new issues were opened to ensure the specifications accurately reflect the Go implementations.
    *   [#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/725) was created to add missing Super DA error codes related to reorgs, aiming for consistent error handling.
    *   [#731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/731) was opened to add a missing `chainId` field to the `ExecutingDescriptor` within the interoperability specifications.

*   **CI/CD and Testing Infrastructure:**
    *   A significant discussion continued on defining CI SLAs ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16437)). Developers provided feedback on proposed metrics, expressing concerns about a high failure rate tolerance (5%) and long completion times (1 hour). The prevalence of flaky tests was a major point of concern, with suggestions to improve processes for fixing or preventing them.
    *   Discussion on making the dependency set configurable in `supersim` ([#361](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/361)) progressed, with a proposal to add a flag for specifying chains to improve testing flexibility.

*   **Feature Rollout Planning:**
    *   The issue for enabling flashblocks on op-sepolia ([#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16496)) was noted as being blocked. The long-term plan is to deploy it in a `dry_run` mode for thorough testing.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted a strong internal feedback loop, particularly visible in the detailed discussion on CI SLAs ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16437)). Developers actively engaged in shaping internal processes by providing critical feedback on proposed metrics and test stability. The overall activity points to a period of collaborative planning and specification maintenance, ensuring alignment between documentation and implementation across the project.
