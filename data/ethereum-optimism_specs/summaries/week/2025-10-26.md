# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a massive and coordinated effort to enhance the OP Stack's foundational documentation. A significant number of new specifications were created for critical contracts, covering fault proofs, cross-chain communication, and token bridging. This push for clarity and completeness improves the developer experience and provides a canonical reference for core components. Alongside this documentation initiative, the Jovian protocol specification was updated to align with recent `op-geth` changes for data availability. Active discussions also progressed on key topics, including alternative DA integration with Celestia, L3 configuration, and improving the robustness of the testing suite.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The primary focus was a comprehensive expansion of contract specifications, bringing canonical documentation to a wide array of OP Stack components.

- **Cross-Chain Communication & Bridging Specs:** A major effort was made to document the contracts responsible for interoperability. This included adding detailed specifications for the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` and `L2CrossDomainMessenger` ([#837](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/837), [#840](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/840)), the `L1StandardBridge` and `L2StandardBridge` ([#844](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/844), [#843](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/843)), and the ERC721 bridges for both L1 and L2 ([#830](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/830), [#831](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/831)).

- **Fault Proof & Oracle Specifications:** The documentation for the fault proof system was expanded with new specifications for the `DisputeGameFactory` ([#829](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/829)), the `PreimageOracle` ([#845](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/845)), and the `LivenessModule` ([#828](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/828)).

- **Core Contract & Token Specs:** Specifications were also created for the `OptimismMintableERC721` token standard and its factory ([#832](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/832), [#833](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/833)), as well as the `L1Block` predeploy contract that provides L1 context on L2 ([#842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/842)).

- **Jovian Protocol Update:** The Jovian specification was updated to include new `daFootprintGasScalar` receipt fields and to set `blobGasUsed` to the transaction's DA footprint, ensuring the spec aligns with recent implementations in `op-geth` ([#839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/839)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:** Several issues were resolved, improving project health and documentation quality. This included fixing broken internal documentation links ([#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1797), [#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1802)), resolving a websocket timeout issue related to Cloudflare/GCP ([#17858](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17858)), and closing a task for enhanced `op-deployer` testing which was addressed by recently added integration tests ([#16842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16842)).

- **New & Active Issues:** Discussions this week centered on future improvements and integrations:
    - **Celestia DA Integration:** Progress was made on addressing the `op-batcher`'s max frame size limitation for alternative DA layers. A fix from the Celestia team was reviewed, and a pull request was subsequently opened to implement the change ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17796), [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17872)).
    - **Jovian Compatibility:** An ongoing discussion highlighted that new fields in `rollupConfig` are causing "unknown field" errors for zk stacks. This points to a need for better versioning or clearer expectations for RPC method bodies to ensure backward compatibility ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17907)).
    - **L3 Configuration:** A proposal was discussed to have `op-node` and `op-program` automatically detect if their configured "L1" is an L2, which would simplify configuration for L3s ([#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18070)).
    - **Test Stability:** An active discussion is underway to address race conditions in acceptance tests by improving wallet management, potentially by using faucets to fund unique wallets per test to ensure isolation ([#18063](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18063)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The high volume of related pull requests for contract specifications indicates strong, coordinated work within the core development team. A clear example of cross-ecosystem collaboration was observed in the active issue discussions regarding the Celestia batcher, where a fix from the Celestia team was reviewed and a pull request was requested and delivered, demonstrating healthy partnership on alternative DA solutions.
