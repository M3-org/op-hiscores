# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Aug 3 - 9, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on protocol specification and governance process maintenance. A new pull request was introduced to define block calldata limits, representing forward movement on core protocol rules. Additionally, the team demonstrated responsiveness to community feedback by investigating and resolving an issue related to project flagging within the RetroPGF process. Overall, it was a period of foundational work and process refinement rather than merged feature development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No pull requests were merged this week. However, work was initiated on a new protocol specification:

- A new proposal, [#746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/746), was opened to add a formal specification for block calldata limits. This work is currently awaiting review and aims to solidify a key constraint within the protocol.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving a community-reported problem within the RetroPGF governance process.

- **Closed Issues:** An issue concerning the RetroPGF process, [#72](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/72), was resolved. A community member reported that their project, "World Mini Apps," had been inappropriately flagged. The issue was acknowledged, investigated, and confirmed as resolved by the team.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened during this period, and no other significant active issues were reported.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The primary collaboration observed this week was the interaction between the community and maintainers regarding the RetroPGF process.

This interaction underscores the project's commitment to community governance and public goods funding mechanisms.
