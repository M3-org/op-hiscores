# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a strong focus on protocol stability and codebase hygiene. A critical bug fix was merged to correct the flashblocks specification, enhancing protocol accuracy. Concurrently, a significant effort was dedicated to issue tracker maintenance, resulting in the closure of numerous outdated issues related to RPCs, interop specifications, and flaky tests. This cleanup was balanced by a rigorous review process that saw several previously closed issues reopened due to unresolved `TODO`s in the code, underscoring a commitment to ensuring complete and thorough resolutions.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
While the week was light on new features, a key correction was made to the protocol specifications, and new tooling was proposed to improve code quality.

- **Protocol Specification Fixes**
    - A correction was merged for the flashblocks specifications, ensuring their accuracy and contributing to the overall stability of the protocol ([#860](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/860)).

- **Code Quality Improvements**
    - A new pull request was opened to introduce a GitHub Actions workflow for Pylint analysis ([#862](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/862)). This initiative aims to enforce code quality and consistency across the repository.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management was a central theme this week, with a large volume of older issues being closed while others were reopened for further work. Notably, no new issues were opened during this period.

- **Closed Issues:**
    A significant cleanup effort addressed and closed a wide range of issues:
    - **Specification Cleanup:** Issues related to RPC specifications for `optimism_dependencySet` ([#713](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/713)) and `op-node` managed-mode RPC ([#582](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/582)) were closed. Outdated interop specifications were also cleaned up ([#628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/628), [#633](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/633)).
    - **Superchain Registry 2.0:** Enhancements were completed, including updates to the `add-chain` tool to allow opt-in for hardforks ([#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/610)) and the closure of a now-irrelevant L2 key handover test issue ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/643)).
    - **Test Stability & CI:** Several flaky tests were resolved ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17966), [#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18138)), and a CI job was improved to provide better summaries ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/644)).
    - **General Housekeeping:** A number of older issues, including those related to `op-geth` state corruption ([#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/549)) and stuck goroutines ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16332)), were closed due to age or resolution.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Reopened Issues for TODOs:** A significant trend was the reopening of several issues related to interop, sync mechanisms, and the supervisor ([#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16140), [#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16141), [#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15817), and others). This was done because unresolved `TODO` comments in the code still referenced them, indicating that the underlying tasks were not fully complete.
    - **EL Sync Behavior:** Discussions on issues concerning EL sync correctness ([#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17631), [#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18124), [#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18125)) concluded with a decision to defer work until the request/response sync mechanism is fully deprecated, showing strategic prioritization.
    - **Ongoing Investigations:** A flaky test, `TestBreakTimestampInvariant` ([#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18137)), remains under active investigation. Additionally, the final design for Fusaka-on-L2 ([#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/355)) is pending customer feedback.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was focused on internal maintenance and rigorous quality control. The activity highlights a healthy dynamic of review and accountability among core maintainers.

- Contributor `ajsutton` played a key role in ensuring codebase integrity by systematically reopening issues that were linked to unresolved `TODO`s, preventing premature closure.
- Contributor `mslipper` was active in triaging issues, providing context, and making strategic decisions, such as deferring work on EL sync issues to align with broader deprecation plans.
- The interaction between maintainers, such as the reopening of an issue previously closed by another team member ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15817)), demonstrates a strong, collaborative process focused on achieving complete and correct solutions.
