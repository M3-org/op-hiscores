# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant progress in formalizing future protocol upgrades and enhancing the tooling for network maintenance. Key efforts focused on expanding the Jovian protocol specifications, particularly by defining the data availability footprint limits. Concurrently, the team invested heavily in improving the scripts used to generate upgrade transactions, streamlining the process for future hardforks. This forward-looking work was balanced with resolving existing issues, including a long-standing archive node synchronization problem and preparations for the upcoming Fusaka hardfork.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on protocol specification expansion, tooling improvements, and documentation refinement.

- **Jovian Protocol Specification Expansion:** The specifications for the Jovian upgrade were significantly advanced with the addition of details for the data availability (DA) footprint limit ([#767](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/767)). A minor typo in the Jovian system-config documentation was also corrected ([#768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/768)).

- **Network Upgrade Tooling Enhancements:** A major effort was made to improve the process of generating specifications for network upgrades. New scripts were added to streamline the creation of upgrade and proxy update transaction specs ([#673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/673)). The tooling was further refined by factoring out per-fork constants and co-locating scripts for better organization and deduplication ([#780](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/780)).

- **Documentation and Specification Refinements:** Several updates were made to improve the clarity and accuracy of existing specifications. This included fixing broken links in configurability documentation ([#765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/765)), adding more detail about the `minBaseFee` in system configuration ([#766](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/766)), clarifying `operatorFee` attributes ([#774](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/774)), and correcting a bug related to flashblocks authorship ([#775](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/775)).

- **New Specification Proposals:** A new pull request was opened to introduce specifications for revenue sharing ([#782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/782)), signaling the start of work on a new protocol feature.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project saw the resolution of several important issues related to node stability, tooling, and testing, while new discussions began on standardizing upgrade procedures and ensuring forward compatibility.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Node Stability & Bug Fixes:** A key issue improving archive node synchronization via a configurable timeout was resolved ([#13852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/13852)), and a bug causing failures in RLP receipt decoding was fixed ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/679)).
    - **Tooling & Process Improvements:** The effort to improve the specs upgrade transaction generator script was completed ([#779](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/779)), as was the work to create a single source of truth for address structs ([#14977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/14977)).
    - **Testing & Analysis:** Several testing and analysis tasks were concluded, including load testing for flashblocks ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16756)), evaluation of partner support criteria ([#16765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16765)), and threat modeling for the DA Footprint Limit ([#336](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/336)).
    - **Hardfork Preparation:** Preparations for the Fusaka activation on L1 were completed for `proxyd` ([#467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/467)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Standardizing Network Upgrades:** A significant new discussion was opened in [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/781) to establish a new convention for deploying contracts during network upgrades, aiming to avoid potential address computation issues.
    - **System Configuration:** A cluster of new issues ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/770), [#771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/771), [#777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/777)) highlights a focus on clarifying system configuration parameters and ensuring forward compatibility for client parsing of `SystemConfig.ConfigUpdate` events.
    - **Ongoing Challenges:** The flakiness of the `TestPreNoInbox` acceptance test ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17298)) remains an ongoing stability concern, with a recent fix attempt proving unsuccessful. Additionally, discussions on preparing `op-node` for the Fusaka hardfork ([#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17493)) raised concerns about tight coupling with upstream Geth code.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week saw deep technical collaboration on forward-looking architectural decisions. The new issue regarding network upgrade transactions ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/781)) immediately sparked a detailed analysis from Protolambda on address computation, demonstrating proactive design and risk assessment. Similarly, the ongoing effort to resolve test flakiness in [#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17298) involves multiple contributors tracking and attempting to diagnose the persistent issue. The discussion around improving documentation in [#771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/771) also incorporated suggestions from the wider community, reflecting a healthy feedback loop.
