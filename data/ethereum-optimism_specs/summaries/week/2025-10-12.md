# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on advancing the specifications for the upcoming Jovian upgrade. The primary focus was on refining the Data Availability (DA) footprint limit. Key updates were made to utilize `blobGasUsed` for this limit and to correct the storage location for the associated gas scalar. This work resolves a key design issue and moves the Jovian upgrade specifications closer to completion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week was concentrated on specifications related to the Jovian upgrade's data availability mechanism.

- **DA Footprint Limit Specification:** Progress was made on the DA footprint limit specifications. The specs were updated to use `blobGasUsed`, and a fix was implemented for the storage location of the DA footprint gas scalar ([#800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/800)).
- **Jovian Upgrade Transactions:** In support of the upgrade, a new pull request was opened to regenerate the Jovian upgrade transactions ([#799](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/799)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** An issue regarding the DA footprint block limit specification was closed ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/792)). The resolution, implemented in PR [#800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/800), confirmed the design decision to use the `blobBaseFee` header field for the new gas-like dimension rather than modifying the existing `gasUsed` field.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened during the reporting period, and there were no active issues with significant discussion.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The provided reports for the week did not contain specific details on community collaboration or high-discussion threads. The work was focused and directly related to implementing previously discussed design decisions for the Jovian upgrade.
