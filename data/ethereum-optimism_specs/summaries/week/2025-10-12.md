# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on refining the specifications for the upcoming Jovian upgrade. The primary focus was on the Data Availability (DA) footprint limit, with updates to use `blobGasUsed` for calculations. This work ensures the block limit specifications align with the latest design decisions for the new gas-like dimension introduced in Jovian.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on updating the specifications for the Jovian upgrade's DA footprint mechanism.

- **DA Footprint Limit Specification Update:** The specifications were updated to use `blobGasUsed` for the DA footprint limit. A related fix was also implemented for the storage location of the DA footprint gas scalar, ensuring correct implementation of the new gas dimension ([#800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/800)).
- **Jovian Upgrade Transactions:** A pull request was opened to regenerate the Jovian upgrade transactions, likely to incorporate the recent specification changes ([#799](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/799)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was directly tied to the development work on the Jovian upgrade specifications.

- **Closed Issues:** An issue regarding the DA footprint block limit specification was resolved. The resolution, implemented in PR [#800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/800), clarified that the `blobBaseFee` header field should be used for the new gas dimension instead of modifying the existing `gasUsed` field ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/792)).
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened based on the provided reports.
