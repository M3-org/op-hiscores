# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on protocol refinement and specification cleanup, particularly for the upcoming Jovian upgrade. A key clarification was made to require `PayloadAttributes.MinBaseFee` to be `NULL` pre-Jovian, enhancing protocol explicitness. Significant progress was made in closing out a backlog of issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature integration. Additionally, a critical discussion on handling large genesis files in `op-geth` was resolved, providing a clear path forward for node operators.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this period centered on improving the clarity and accuracy of the protocol specifications.

- **Jovian Protocol Specification Refinement:** A crucial update was merged to clarify protocol behavior before the Jovian upgrade. PR [#756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/756) explicitly requires `PayloadAttributes.MinBaseFee` to be `NULL`, addressing a need for greater precision in the specs.

- **Configuration and Address Updates:** A series of new pull requests were opened to keep configuration files and contract addresses current. This includes updates to the L1 Block Info contract address ([#758](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/758)) and the `eth2_config.yaml` file ([#759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/759), [#760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/760)). Another PR, [#757](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/757), was also opened.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of several important issues, clearing the way for future development and improving the developer experience.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **`min-base-fee` Feature Integration:** A cluster of issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature was closed, marking progress in its specification. This included adding `minBaseFee` to the block header's `extraData` ([#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/649)), adding the field to `PayloadAttributesV3` ([#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/650)), and updating `eip1559.CalcBaseFee` logic ([#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/651)).
    - **`op-geth` Genesis Handling:** A long-standing discussion on initializing `op-geth` with large genesis files ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/668)) was resolved. The recommended solution involves modifying `op-geth` to not store the large `alloc` data from the genesis file and instead include the `stateHash` in the chain config, enabling nodes to snap-sync.
    - **Protocol Clarity:** An issue opened to request explicit clarification on `PayloadAttributes.MinBaseFee` requirements pre-Jovian ([#755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/755)) was resolved the same day, leading directly to the update in PR [#756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/756).
    - **Development Environment Shift:** The issue to integrate `op-nat` into Kurtosis network tests ([#158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/158)) was closed, signaling a strategic decision to prioritize other local development environments.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - An ongoing discussion in [#763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/763) focuses on making Superchain configurations fully self-descriptive. The goal is to ensure `ChainConfig` files contain a complete set of values, reducing reliance on inherited or implicitly populated data, which represents significant future work in simplifying chain configuration.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
- The resolution of the `op-geth` genesis issue ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/668)) highlighted effective collaboration, with @protolambda providing a detailed technical explanation that was acknowledged and accepted by @cliff0412.
- The rapid turnaround on issue [#755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/755), from identification to a merged pull request, demonstrates the team's responsiveness in maintaining specification accuracy.
- Ongoing discussions, such as the one on Superchain configuration explicitness ([#763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/763)) involving @alfonso-op, show a continued commitment to improving the developer experience across the ecosystem.
