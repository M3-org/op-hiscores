# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity focused on refining and introducing new specifications, alongside key tooling advancements. Work was initiated to introduce L2CM (L2 Chain Management) specifications and to fix specifications for flashblocks. Discussions progressed on adapting tooling for the upcoming Dispute Game v2, while a significant tooling shift was noted with the planned deprecation of Kurtosis. Additionally, several issues related to the Kona client were resolved or saw progress, improving its compatibility and feature set within the ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
While no pull requests were merged this week, significant new work was proposed to enhance protocol specifications.

- **New Specification Proposals:**
    - A proposal for **L2CM (L2 Chain Management) specifications** was introduced in PR [#861](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/861).
    - A fix for **flashblocks specifications** was opened in PR [#860](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/860) to address identified issues.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week centered on improving Kona client compatibility and planning for future protocol upgrades and tooling changes.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Kona & `op-program` Improvements:** Two issues were closed, enhancing client compatibility. Issue [#18203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18203) was resolved after an update to Kona fixed its incompatibility with websocket URLs for L2 EL connections. Issue [#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17416) was closed, as Kona's direct storage lookup for block headers provides a hint similar to the one requested for `op-program`.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this week.
    - **Dispute Game v2 Compatibility:** Discussion continued in [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1148) on updating scripts for Dispute Game v2. The focus is on adapting scripts to read arguments from the Dispute Game Factory (DGF) and accounting for multiple permissionless game types.
    - **Kona Custom Prestes:** Progress was noted on [#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18271), which tracks adding support for embedded custom prestates to Kona, with a fix currently under review.
    - **Tooling Deprecation:** A comment on issue [#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16704) indicated that Kurtosis is being deprecated for `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack`, signaling a strategic shift in the project's testing and deployment tooling.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident through cross-repository work, particularly between the `specs` and `op-rs/kona` teams. The resolution of Kona-related issues ([#18203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18203)) and the ongoing work on custom prestates ([#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18271)) highlight the active coordination to ensure the Rust client aligns with protocol specifications. Furthermore, ongoing technical discussions in active issues like the Dispute Game v2 compatibility plan ([#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1148)) demonstrate continued alignment among core contributors on future protocol features.
