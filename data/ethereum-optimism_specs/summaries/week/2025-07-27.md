# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a strong focus on refining and clarifying existing specifications, alongside laying the groundwork for new protocol features. Significant progress was made in improving documentation accuracy, aligning interoperability terminology, and advancing the `min-base-fee` specification through cross-repository collaboration. Key maintenance tasks were also completed, including the removal of a deprecated feature from the specs and streamlining the repository's review process, reflecting a commitment to both quality and efficiency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the clarity, accuracy, and consistency of the project's specifications and documentation.

- **Specification and Documentation Refinements:** A series of pull requests were merged to enhance the quality of the documentation. This included fixing a broken link in the predeploys documentation ([#716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/716)), correcting a typo ([#721](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/721)), and making minor grammatical improvements ([#704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/704)). The Supervisor API specification was updated to clarify how null block references are represented ([#739](https://github.ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/739)), and the Optimism Portal fault-proof specs received minor cleanups to better align with the implementation ([#745](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/745)).

- **Interop Specification Alignment:** To improve consistency between the specification and implementation, the `SafetyLevel` terminology in the interop specs was clarified. A change was made to explicitly state that the `unsafe` safety level corresponds to `local-unsafe`, resolving a point of ambiguity ([#722](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/722)).

- **Repository Maintenance and Cleanup:** General maintenance included removing the spec for the custom gas token feature, which is no longer being pursued ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/689)). Based on team feedback, the `CODEOWNERS` file was removed to streamline the review process ([#743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/743)). Additionally, a standardized legal footer was added to the documentation site ([#595](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/595)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on defining new features and resolving inconsistencies in existing specifications.

- **Closed Issues:** Two issues related to interoperability terminology were resolved. Issue [#714](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/714) concerning the `interop_ready` RPC and issue [#717](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/717) addressing inconsistencies in safety level naming (e.g., `Unsafe` vs. `LocalUnsafe`) were both closed, bringing greater clarity to the interop specifications.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **New Specifications:** Two issues were opened to kickstart the definition of new specifications. [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/741) proposes porting the `SuperchainConfig` type into the specs, while [#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/742) initiates the process of writing the specification for the `min-base-fee` feature.
    - **Min Base Fee Progress:** The `min-base-fee` feature saw significant activity. The main tracking issue ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16807)) was updated with links to draft implementations in the `reth`, `op-alloy`, and `optimism` repositories, indicating coordinated, cross-repository development. A discussion on the related spec issue ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/742)) highlighted the need to consider the state growth impact of the feature.
    - **Congestion Control Discussion:** An older issue regarding a design for congestion-based builder transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/306)) saw renewed interest, with a community member offering to collaborate on the design document.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the multi-repository effort to implement the `min-base-fee` feature, with draft pull requests shared across `reth`, `op-alloy`, and `optimism` to gather early feedback. The discussion on issue [#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/306) also highlighted community engagement, with an offer to collaborate on a new design. Internally, the decision to remove the `CODEOWNERS` file was noted as a response to team feedback, demonstrating a focus on improving internal development workflows.
