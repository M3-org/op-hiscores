# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on refining the fault-proof system and advancing light client capabilities. A key milestone was achieved with the completion of work enabling the `op-node` light client to follow external data sources, enhancing its flexibility. Concurrently, the dispute game specifications were updated to maintain alignment with the current implementation, reflecting a commitment to accurate documentation. Active discussions continue around the `op-challenger` component, focusing on ensuring correct trace outputs and integration with other parts of the system.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
This week's development focused on ensuring the specifications accurately reflect the state of the fault-proof system.

- **Fault Proof System Specification:** The dispute game interface specifications were updated to match the current implementation ([#871](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/871)). This change specifically addresses the `setImplementation()` function, ensuring the documentation remains a reliable source for developers interacting with the fault-proof system.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of a key feature for the `op-node` light client, while discussions progressed on the correctness of the fault-proof challenger.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **`op-node` Light Client Development:** A significant issue was closed, marking the successful implementation of external source following for the `op-node` light client ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18317)). This allows the node to mirror external safe/finalized feeds using the `--l2.follow.source` flag, a key step in its development.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this period.
    - Discussion remains active on an issue concerning the correct trace output in `op-challenger` ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18643)). The conversation confirms that the super node trace provider now handles cases where the next super root is not found. However, the issue remains open pending an integration test to verify the alignment between `op-challenger` and `op-program`, especially as `op-supervisor` is slated for removal.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The detailed technical discussion on active issue [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18643) highlights close collaboration on the fault-proof system. The dialogue, which spans the behavior of `op-challenger`, `op-program`, and RPC endpoints, demonstrates a focused effort to ensure the correctness and seamless integration of the system's various components.
