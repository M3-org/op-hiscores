# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity focused on refining protocol specifications for greater clarity and robustness. A key update was merged to define the handling of malformed system configuration updates, ensuring predictable protocol behavior. Concurrently, an important discussion continued around a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recovery mode, highlighting an ongoing effort to ensure the stability of core components.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the precision of the protocol specifications.

### System Configuration Specification Refinement
To enhance protocol clarity, a change was merged to explicitly define how malformed system configuration updates are handled. The specification now states that such updates are to be "skipped," preventing ambiguity when the protocol encounters invalid configuration data ([#868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/868)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed based on the week's reports. The primary focus was on an existing critical issue.

### New & Active Issues
- **Sequencer Recovery Mode Behavior:** Significant discussion continued on issue [#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18350), which concerns a potential bug causing the `op-node` sequencer to stall in recovery mode. The investigation points to the sequencer requesting a non-existent L1 origin block, leading to temporary errors. A pull request in the main `optimism` repository was identified as potentially related to this behavior, indicating active debugging on this front.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the focused discussion surrounding the sequencer recovery mode bug ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18350)). The cross-referencing of a pull request from the `ethereum-optimism/optimism` repository shows active coordination between teams working on different parts of the OP Stack to diagnose and resolve complex, interdependent issues.
