# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Jun 8 - 14, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on improving the reliability and clarity of the OP Stack specifications and tooling. While major feature development was quiet, significant progress was made in diagnosing and addressing flakiness in CI and acceptance tests. Key activities included targeted documentation updates to reflect the current state of Fault Proof VMs and interop specifications. Discussions around the `op-supervisor`'s behavior and a new initiative to rename its operational modes signal a strong focus on enhancing system stability and developer experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on precise updates to the project's specifications and documentation to ensure accuracy.

*   **Specification and Documentation Refinements**
    *   A bug was fixed in the interop specifications that incorrectly reset event descriptions, ensuring the `managed-mode.md` file is accurate ([#719](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/719)).
    *   The documentation for Fault Proof Virtual Machines was updated to mark "cannon-rs" as deprecated and correctly list "Cannon" as 64-bit, keeping the fault-proof system specs current ([#720](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/720)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a concerted effort to tackle system reliability, clarify component naming, and plan for future features, alongside resolving outdated documentation.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   An issue regarding the `L2OutputOracleProxy` was closed, clarifying that the component is deprecated and the related documentation was outdated. This cleanup helps prevent confusion for developers using the specs ([#1614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1614)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Test Reliability:** A major theme this week was improving test stability. Discussions on CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16271)) identified infrastructure as a primary cause, and a new issue was opened to formally track efforts to improve acceptance test reliability, aiming for consistent pass rates ([#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16378)).
    *   **Supervisor Stability and Clarity:** Several active discussions focused on the `op-supervisor`. These include a critical investigation into an event overflow bug that can cause crash-loops ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16335)) and a proposal to simplify L1 origin validity checks ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16315)). A new ticket was also created to rename supervisor and op-node modes to improve clarity ([#16379](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16379)).
    *   **Future Work & Bug Fixes:** A new issue was opened to track the development of a "Gas Tank" contract, with a PR already linked ([#836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/836)). An older issue concerning an incorrect nonce from `eth_getTransactionCount` ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/623)) also saw renewed activity.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions within active issues. The investigation into `op-supervisor` event overflows ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16335)) and the push for more reliable acceptance tests ([#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16378)) showcased focused, problem-solving dialogue among team members. Furthermore, work on items like the Fault Proof creator contract ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15789)) and the complete withdrawal flow test ([#327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/327)) highlighted cross-repository collaboration, with links to active pull requests in the main `optimism` repository.
