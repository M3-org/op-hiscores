# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Jul 6 - 12, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's reported activity centered on enhancing the Superchain's interoperability specifications. Key updates were made to improve cross-chain communication and L1 origin tracking for L2 blocks. Additionally, an important clarification was provided regarding the intentional initialization of precompile addresses within the OP Stack, resolving a long-standing point of discussion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
### Superchain Interoperability Enhancements
Work focused on refining the `specs/interop/managed-node.md` specification to improve how supervised chains interact within the Superchain. A new derivation type, `DerivationCurrentL1Update`, was added to support ongoing discussions ([#733](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/733)). To improve L2 block origin tracking, the `interop_blockRefByNumber` function was extended to `interop_l2BlockRefByNumber`, allowing supervisors to more accurately determine the L1 origin of an L2 block ([#735](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/735)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** Based on the available reports, no issues were closed this week.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. Discussion continued in issue [#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16620) concerning the initialization of precompile addresses (0x00-0xff). A clarification was added, noting that the 1 wei balance is an intentional design choice to comply with protocol rules regarding empty accounts.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The primary community interaction noted this week was the ongoing technical discussion in issue [#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16620), which served to clarify a core aspect of the OP Stack's state initialization for the community.
