# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Sep 28 - 4, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant progress in closing out major initiatives and refining protocol specifications. Key achievements include the completion of the Isthmus Upgrade, confirmed by the closure of its tracking issue, and the successful deployment and load testing of flashblocks-rpc nodes. Work also progressed on protocol security with a clarification to the Fusaka defense mechanism. Concurrently, important discussions identified a blocking issue with Go 1.25 compatibility affecting Cannon and shifted the integration strategy for `op-reth` towards the `devstack` / `sysgo` system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development effort this week focused on enhancing protocol security and clarity.

- **Protocol Specification Refinements:** A pull request ([#790](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/790)) was opened to clarify the specifications for the Fusaka defense mechanism, improving the protocol's robustness.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of several key issues, while active discussions highlighted future technical challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Protocol Upgrades & Syncing:** The tracker for the Isthmus Upgrade was closed, marking the successful completion of this major initiative ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/12703)). An investigation into L2 Execution Layer sync conditions was also concluded, determining that `engineController.insertUnsafePayload` adequately handles syncs after the initial run ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17628)).
    - **Infrastructure & Testing:** The deployment of flashblocks-rpc nodes was completed ([#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16764]), and associated load test results were documented ([#17462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17462)). An issue to improve `op-acceptor` test reporting was also resolved ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/386)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this week.
    - **Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility:** A significant blocker was identified in issue [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17060), where Go 1.25 is causing incorrect Keccak hashes in Cannon. The issue is linked to a blocking problem in the Go toolchain, and the recent Go 1.25.1 release does not appear to contain the required MIPS fix.
    - **`op-reth` Integration Strategy:** Discussion in [#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17475) resulted in a strategic shift for testing `op-reth`. With the Kurtosis devnet deprecated, the focus will now be on integrating `op-reth` into the `devstack` / `sysgo` system.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the active discussions around complex technical issues. The resolution of the L2 EL sync conditions ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17628)) involved detailed back-and-forth, leading to a consensus on the path forward. Similarly, ongoing conversations about Cannon's compatibility with Go 1.25 ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17060)) and the strategic pivot for `op-reth` testing ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17475)) demonstrate active problem-solving and planning among contributors.
