# ethereum-optimism/specs Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on advancing the operational readiness of flashblocks and cleaning up long-standing specification issues. Significant progress was made by closing several issues related to flashblocks deployment on op-sepolia, including the websocket-proxy and RPC configuration. Discussions were heavily focused on establishing robust monitoring and alerting for this new infrastructure. Concurrently, the team resolved older issues concerning Interoperability specifications, bringing more clarity to the protocol. While direct code changes to the specification were minor, the week was defined by crucial progress in deployment, planning, and issue triage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work merged this week focused on improving the quality and correctness of the repository's documentation and configuration.

- **Documentation and Configuration Fixes:** Minor but important maintenance was completed. Internal documentation links within `derivation.md` were corrected to properly reference glossary terms ([#740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/740)). Additionally, a syntax error was resolved by removing a trailing comma in the `.markdownlint.json` configuration file ([#737](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/737)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was a primary activity this week, with a strong focus on closing out tasks related to flashblocks and older specification items.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Deployment:** A series of issues tracking the rollout of flashblocks on op-sepolia were closed, signaling major steps toward completion. This included tasks for enabling flashblocks non-publicly ([#16544](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16544)), configuring the `flashblocks-rpc` ([#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16496)), and deploying the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` ([#16686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16686)).
    - **Specification Cleanup:** Two older issues were resolved to update Interoperability specifications. [#277](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/277) addressed the event-index wildcard feature, and [#609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/609) focused on upgrading block rule specifications.
    - **Node Improvements:** An issue to improve `op-supervisor` and `op-node` reset targets ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16314)) was closed, as its actionable items were deemed covered by existing pull requests.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Monitoring:** The most significant ongoing discussion occurred in [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16388), which details the plan for comprehensive monitoring and alerting for the flashblocks integration on op-sepolia. The discussion outlined specific metrics and thresholds for peer counts, block progression, and performance metrics like `reth_op_rbuilder_total_block_built_duration`, indicating a deep focus on operational stability.
    - **Tooling and Testing:** An issue to add a semgrep rule for function naming conventions ([#15115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15115)) remains active but is currently blocked by disabled GitHub Actions. Separately, work continues on integrating test target setup and teardown into `op-acceptor` to improve acceptance test compatibility ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/375)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was characterized by focused, internal planning and cross-repository coordination. The detailed technical discussion in the flashblocks monitoring issue ([#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16388)), which links to work in the `k8s` repository, highlights the team's effort to ensure a smooth and reliable deployment. The proactive closure of issues that were superseded or completed elsewhere demonstrates effective project management and communication within the core team.
