# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 31, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in closing out long-standing issues, particularly around Superchain Registry improvements and CI/testing enhancements. A new pull request was opened to document Jovian precompile input size restrictions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#849](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/849), was opened to document Jovian precompile input size restrictions.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Registry Enhancements and Refinements
Several issues related to the Superchain Registry were closed, indicating significant progress in its development and maintenance. This includes the completion of handling input variations in `add-chain` scripts [#220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/220), the implementation of config parameter checks for each chain [#294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/294), and the resolution of a flakey nil pointer dereference during `add-chain` tests [#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/635). Additionally, the issue of moving L1 RPC URL from superchain init to validation was addressed [#609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/609), and the `ProxyAdminOwner` exceptions for Base and Unichain are believed to be addressed with SCR 2.0 [#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/675). The issue of adding chain names to `addresses.json` was closed as breaking changes did not go well previously [#999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/999).

### Testing and CI Workflow Improvements
Key issues related to testing and continuous integration were closed. The issue of making the `op-acceptance-tests` workflow blocking was resolved, with the tests now preventing merges to `develop` [#16270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16270). A CI flake related to the `add-chain` help flag being redefined was also closed, as the workflow is no longer active and codegen does not seem to flake [#477](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/477).

### Contract and Deployment Configuration Updates
Several issues concerning contract and deployment configurations were closed. This includes the completion of adding `L2ProxyAdminOwner` to TOML files [#470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/470), the support for Holesky testnets [#518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/518), and the addition of contract implementation addresses to superchain config [#520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/520). The overhaul of how fault proofs contract addresses are stored and discovered was also fixed [#604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/604).

### Deployment and Alerting Refinements
Issues related to deployment and alerting were addressed. The `op-deployer` verification guides were closed as no longer a priority [#17145](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17145). The issue of tuning the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy-upstream-messages-low` alert on Sepolia was completed, with op-conductor still not in the flashblocks propagation flow [#17716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17716). A small issue with `op-deployer` logs and Etherscan verification on Sepolia was closed in favor of another issue [#18089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18089).

## NEW ISSUES

### Proxyd Backend Synchronization
A new issue, [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/501), was opened regarding Proxyd's ability to "travel back in time" and return previous blocks as the `unsafe` block when its backends are not in sync. This can be reproduced by querying the unsafe block, getting the block number, and sending an `eth_call` against the unsafe block.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### [op-acceptance-tests] Report unused tests [#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16273)
The latest comment from janjakubnanista asks if this issue is still desired, indicating a potential re-evaluation of its necessity. Previously, alfonso-op suggested a "staging" gate for tests that run but don't block merges, allowing a path to promote them to blocking checks.

### alert when non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off [#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16867)
zhwrd's latest comment questions the relevance of this ticket and whether a detection mechanism for disabled flashblocks already exists. jelias2 previously mentioned that an alert would be created once a specific PR lands.

### [op-acceptance-tests] Parallelise "memory-all" job [#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17525)
janjakubnanista's latest comment asks if this is still a desired action, given that the PR addressing it was autoclosed. The original intent was to parallelize the "memory-all" job to avoid increasing CI duration once the workflow becomes blocking.

### SuperchainRegistry: improve the diff tools [#284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/284)
janjakubnanista asks if the diff tools have been completely revamped with the refactor, suggesting that the issue might be implicitly resolved or significantly altered by recent changes. The original issue aimed to extend diff computation to `op-geth`.

### investigate L2 key handover test [#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/643)
janjakubnanista questions the relevance of this issue after the refactor, indicating a need to assess if the underlying problem still exists or has been addressed by recent changes.

### ci: update `golang-validate-all` job to give summary of passes/failures [#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/644)
janjakubnanista asks if this issue has been addressed by SCR 2.0. Previously, jmcoplabs noted that a refactor to decouple the golang test framework from the validation core logic was in progress, which would enable summaries of validation runs. The issue aims to improve visibility into which chains pass or fail in the `golang-validate-all` CI job.
