## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#849](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/849), was opened to document Jovian precompile input size restrictions.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Registry Enhancements and Cleanup
Several issues related to the Superchain Registry were closed, indicating a push towards a more robust and streamlined system. This includes the completion of handling input variations in `add-chain` scripts ([#220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/220)), the implementation of config parameter checks for each chain ([#294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/294)), and the resolution of a flakey nil pointer dereference during `add-chain` tests ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/635)). Additionally, the issue of moving L1 RPC URL from superchain init to validation was addressed ([#609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/609)), and the `add-chain` help flag redefinition CI flake was resolved ([#477](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/477)). The issue of adding chain names to `addresses.json` was closed as breaking changes did not go well previously ([#999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/999)).

### Test and CI Workflow Improvements
Efforts to improve testing and CI workflows saw the closure of issues aimed at making acceptance tests blocking ([#16270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16270)).

### Documentation and Configuration Updates
Documentation and configuration-related issues were also closed, such as adding `L2ProxyAdminOwner` to TOML files ([#470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/470)), supporting Holesky testnets ([#518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/518)), and adding contract implementation addresses to superchain config ([#520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/520)). The issue of overhauling how fault proofs contract addresses are stored/discovered was also closed ([#604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/604)).

### Flashblocks and Deployment Tooling
Issues related to flashblocks and deployment tooling were addressed, including tuning the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy-upstream-messages-low` alert on Sepolia ([#17716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17716)) and improving `op-deployer` logs and Etherscan verification on Sepolia ([#18089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18089)). A documentation issue for `op-deployer` verification guides was closed as it is no longer a priority ([#17145](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17145)).

## NEW ISSUES

- **Proxyd Time Travel Vulnerability**: A new issue, [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/501), was opened to address a potential vulnerability in Proxyd where it can "travel back in time" and return previous blocks as the `unsafe` block if its backends are not in sync. This can be reproduced by querying the unsafe block, getting its number, and then sending an `eth_call` against that block.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Workflow Enhancements
- **Make acceptance-test workflow blocking** ([#16270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16270)): The issue was closed today, with janjakubnanista confirming that "The tests are now blocking." Previously, alfonso-op had noted that improving test runtime and flakiness would be prerequisites to making this workflow blocking to avoid impacting developer velocity.
- **Report unused tests** ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16273)): janjakubnanista recently asked if this is still a desired feature. Earlier, alfonso-op suggested a "staging" gate for tests that run but don't block merges, allowing a path to promote them to blocking checks.
- **Parallelise "memory-all" job** ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17525)): janjakubnanista inquired if this is still needed, noting that the PR addressing it was autoclosed. The goal is to parallelize the "memory-all" job to prevent increased CI duration once the workflow becomes blocking.

### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerts
- **Alert when non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off** ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16867)): zhwrd recently questioned if this ticket is still relevant or if a detection method for disabled flashblocks already exists. jelias2 previously mentioned that an alert would be created once a specific PR lands.
- **Tune flashblocks-websocket-proxy-upstream-messages-low alert sepolia** ([#17716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17716)): This issue was closed today by yashvardhan-kukreja, stating that the task is complete and `op-conductor` is still not in the flashblocks propagation flow. They noted some progress in troubleshooting but other priorities shifted focus. zhwrd had previously asked for an update on its status.

### Superchain Registry and Configuration
- **SuperchainRegistry: improve the diff tools** ([#284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/284)): janjakubnanista asked if the diff tools have been completely revamped with the refactor, implying potential closure if so. The issue aims to extend diff computation for `op-geth`.
- **Investigate L2 key handover test** ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/643)): janjakubnanista questioned if this is still relevant after the refactor. The issue was opened to investigate a potential bug in the `op-deployer`'s L2 key handover test.
- **CI: update `golang-validate-all` job to give summary of passes/failures** ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/644)): janjakubnanista asked if this has been addressed by SCR 2.0. jmcoplabs previously moved the issue to backlog, noting that a refactor to decouple the golang test framework from validation core logic is underway, which will enable summaries.
- **Encode ProxyAdminOwner exceptions for Base and Unichain** ([#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/675)): janjakubnanista believes this has been addressed with SCR 2.0 and asked for confirmation from @bitwiseguy. alfonso-op previously stated it was blocked on Unichain launch. bitwiseguy had asked for clarification on the standard address, mainnet/sepolia usage, and whether to enshrine the 3/3 address in TOML files.
