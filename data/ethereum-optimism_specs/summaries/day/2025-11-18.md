    - **op-node: On the Initial EL Sync UX and Correctness** ([#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17631)): This issue is being punted until request/response sync is fully deprecated, as it concerns the behavior of op-node marking blocks as finalized during initial EL Sync.
    - **op-node: Safe Head Advancement during EL Sync** ([#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18124)): This issue, related to safe head advancement during EL Sync, can be punted until the full deprecation of request/response sync.
    - **op-node: Unsafe not rewound while `INVALID` during EL Sync** ([#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18125)): This issue, concerning unsafe head behavior during EL Sync, can also be punted until request/response sync is fully deprecated.

- **Fusaka-on-L2 Design**
