## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

- **Superchain Registry 2.0 Enhancements**
    - The `add-chain` tool and its flow were updated to allow chains to opt-in to receive hardforks, addressing previous limitations. ([#610](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/610))
    - An investigation into the L2 key handover test was concluded, with the issue deemed no longer relevant after the Superchain Registry 2.0 refactor. ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/643))
- **CI Pipeline Improvements**
    - The `golang-validate-all` CI job was updated to provide a summary of passes and failures, improving visibility into validation results. ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/644))

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Interop and Sync Mechanism Refinements**
    - Discussions on [#16140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16140) (Interop: Remove anchor point RPC), [#16141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16141) (op-node: Let sync-start not cross into Interop activation), [#16174](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16174) (op-supervisor: Drop multi-node support), [#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15817) (op-devstack: sysext: fix address book), [#16245](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16245) (op-supervisor: remove check-access-list backward compat chainID fallback), and [#16917](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16917) (Clean up Event System Refactor Comments) were reopened by ajsutton. The primary reason for reopening these issues is the presence of unresolved TODOs in the code that directly reference them, indicating that the underlying tasks are not fully complete despite previous closures.
- **EL Sync Behavior and Deprecation**
    - On [#17631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17631) (op-node: On the Initial EL Sync UX and Correctness), mslipper commented that this issue should be addressed once request/response sync is fully deprecated. pcw109550 previously highlighted an edge case during initial EL Sync where `insertUnsafePayload` might miss a state transition if `newPayload` returns SYNCING and `forkchoiceupdated` returns VALID.
    - For [#18124](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18124) (op-node: Safe Head Advancement during EL Sync) and [#18125](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18125) (op-node: Unsafe not rewound while `INVALID` during EL Sync), mslipper suggested punting these issues until the full deprecation of request/response sync.
- **Fusaka-on-L2 Design Finalization**
    - On [#355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/355) (fusaka-on-l2: finalize design), mslipper indicated that the design finalization is pending after checking with customers.
