# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Aug 25, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on integrating the minimum base fee design into the specifications, particularly for the Jovian release. Several tracking and operational issues were closed, indicating progress in clearing outstanding tasks.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Protocol Specification Updates
*   **Minimum Base Fee Integration:** The design document for the minimum base fee was converted into formal specifications, impacting the `exec-engine.md`, `overview.md`, and `system-config.md` files within the `specs/protocol/jovian` directory. This is a significant step in defining the protocol's economic parameters for the upcoming Jovian release. ([#747](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/747))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Operational and Logging Improvements
*   **Logging Cleanup:** An issue related to cleaning up logging in `op-up` was closed, with the note that it's likely not worthwhile without `op-geth` eliminating all use of the global logger. ([#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17007))
*   **Acceptance Test Log Visibility:** An issue concerning missing test logs in `op-acceptance-tests` was closed, as the logs were found in one of the root logs. ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17151))

### Design and Event System Review
*   **Consensus Event Nonces:** A tracking issue for consensus-influencing event nonces for Jovian + Karst was closed, indicating that this feature will not be implemented for the time being. ([#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/13543))
*   **Event Call Graph Analysis:** An issue regarding an event call graph in `op-service` was closed, as similar functionality is being addressed in another pull request, and there's a leaning towards removing the entire event system. ([#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16874))
*   **Scalar Fix Postmortem:** A postmortem issue related to a Scalar fix was closed, as the work was completed during a recent retro. ([#17012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17012))
