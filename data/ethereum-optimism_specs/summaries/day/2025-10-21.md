## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fusaka Upgrade Preparations
Discussions continued regarding the `op-geth` preparation for the Fusaka upgrade [#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/682). It was confirmed that the Sepolia network has completed its Fusaka upgrade, but the task remains open for Mainnet. Similarly, the task to write a `superchain-ops` task for updating the absolute prestate for Fusaka [#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1206) has been completed and executed on Sepolia. The question was raised whether to keep the ticket open to track the Mainnet task.

### Build Environment Issues
A new issue was reported regarding an Optimism `mise install` error due to a version prefix "v" [#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17963). The error occurs when `mise` attempts to retrieve a version with an additional "v" character in the URL. A potential solution was provided, suggesting that this is an issue with the latest version of `mise` and recommending the use of an older, working version installed via a specific script.

### Observability in Devnets
Discussion continued on enabling observability and monitoring in `sysgo` for the rust protocol team's long-running devnets [#17941](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17941). It was noted that this issue might be a duplicate of an existing issue in the `optimism` repository.
