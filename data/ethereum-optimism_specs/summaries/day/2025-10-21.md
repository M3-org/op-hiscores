### Fusaka Upgrade Preparations
Discussions continued regarding the `op-geth` preparation for the Fusaka upgrade [#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/682). It was clarified that the Sepolia preparation is complete, but the Mainnet merge is still pending. Relatedly, the task for updating the absolute prestate for Fusaka [#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1206) has been executed on Sepolia, with a question raised about keeping the ticket open to track the Mainnet task.

### `mise` Installation Error
An active issue [#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17963) reported an Optimism `mise` install error due to a version pre-fix "v". The latest comment suggests that this is an issue with the current version of `mise` and recommends using the install script from the latest `develop` branch of the `optimism` repository, which uses a compatible version of `mise`.
