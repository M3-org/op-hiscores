## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- None

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Monitoring
- Flashblocks were successfully enabled on `prod-mainnet-op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-0` and the remaining sequencers on OP Labs infra, with stability confirmed and associated PRs merged ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16759), [#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16760)).
- Alerts for low peer count health on flashblocks-enabled sequencers were addressed and solved ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16868)).
- An issue regarding alerts for unhealthy non-flashblocks enabled sequencers was closed, as existing alerts already cover this scenario ([#17143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17143)).
- Flashblocks were enabled on `op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-1` mainnet, including the deployment of `rollup-boost` ([#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17317)).

### Infrastructure and Health Checks
- The `op-conductor` with EL P2P health checks was released and deployed, confirming its healthy operation ([#17153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17153)).
- An issue concerning the upgrade of `rbuilder` and `node-reth` for a Reth chain stall fix was closed, as it was deemed a non-blocker for L2 ([#17328](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17328)).

### Documentation and Testing Cleanup
- The tutorial for bridging ETH to OP Mainnet with Viem-Supported Networks was updated to include an example for custom chains ([#1473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1473)).
- Several smoke test issues for `op-challenger`, proofs, `op-dispute-mon`, and `op-proposer` were closed as they are no longer required ([#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/141), [#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/140), [#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/142), [#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/143)).

### Feature Implementation Decisions
- The feature request to implement Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy was closed, with a note that it will not be implemented and a TODO in the code needs to be removed ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17194)).

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Contract Upgrade Testing
- **Add soneium to contract upgrade tests** ([#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17332)): A PR has been opened to address this issue, which aims to include `soneium` in the contract upgrade tests within the CI.

### op-program Enhancements
- **op-program: Add hint for fast block header oracle lookup** ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17416)): A draft PR has been created to add a hint to specs and `op-program` for faster block header oracle lookups. The next step involves validating the information in the draft PR.
