# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day focused heavily on documentation, with significant progress made in specifying core L1 and L2 contracts. This enhances clarity and understanding of the Optimism ecosystem's foundational components.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Comprehensive L2 Contract Specifications:** Detailed specifications were added for the L2StandardBridge and L1Block contracts, providing in-depth documentation for their functionalities and interactions within the L2 environment. ([#843](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/843), [#842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/842))
*   **Fault Proof System Documentation:** A comprehensive specification for the PreimageOracle contract was created, outlining its role in providing data availability for fault proof execution. ([#845](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/845))
*   **L1 Standard Bridge Specification:** A new specification for the L1StandardBridge contract was added, documenting its role in cross-chain token transfers. ([#844](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/844))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Jovian Rollup Configuration Breaking Changes:** Discussions continued regarding the impact of new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` on zk stacks like op-succinct and kailua. A new field, `daFootprintGasScalar`, was noted to be causing further breakage. The possibility of versioning or setting clearer expectations for RPC method bodies was raised, with a recent Kona release for Jovian being highlighted as a potential solution. ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17907))
*   **op-devstack Race Conditions in Acceptance Tests:** The issue of race conditions arising from the abuse of `dsl.EOA` in acceptance tests was discussed. Suggestions included strengthening the `*dsl.EOA` abstraction or using faucets to fund new, unique wallets for each test to ensure isolation. The limitations of parallelizing certain tests and the role of `op-acceptor` were also part of the conversation. ([#18063](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18063))
*   **L1 Chain Config for L3s:** The need for op-node and op-program to skip L1 chain configuration for L3s was discussed. A suggestion was made to automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID and apply L3 behavior, similar to how L1 mainnet and Sepolia are recognized.
