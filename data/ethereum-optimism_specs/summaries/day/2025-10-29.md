# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused entirely on documentation enhancements, with significant progress made in specifying core L1 and L2 contracts and the PreimageOracle for fault proof execution.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Comprehensive Contract Specifications
Detailed specifications were added for several critical contracts, enhancing clarity and understanding of their functionalities within the Optimism ecosystem.
- L2StandardBridge specification was created, detailing ETH and ERC20 token transfers between L1 and L2 ([#843](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/843)).
- L1Block predeploy contract specification was added, outlining its role in maintaining L1 block context on L2 ([#842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/842)).
- A comprehensive specification for the PreimageOracle contract was developed, covering its function in providing data availability for fault proof execution ([#845](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/845)).
- The L1StandardBridge contract received a comprehensive specification, documenting its role in the canonical OP Stack ([#844](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/844)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Celestia Batcher DA Size Fix Investigation
Discussion continued on investigating and upstreaming a fix for the Celestia batcher DA size issue ([#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17872)). A PR has been opened to address this, indicating progress on the issue.

### Jovian Rollup Configuration Field Marshalling
The issue regarding marshaling new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` for Jovian ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17907)) saw further discussion. A new field `daFootprintGasScalar` caused breakage for zk stacks, highlighting the need for versioning or clearer expectations around RPC method body changes. A Jovian-ready release for Kona is now available.

### op-devstack Race Conditions from `dsl.EOA` Abuse
Discussions on resolving race conditions in op-devstack arising from `dsl.EOA` abuse ([#18063](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18063)) explored solutions. The consensus leans towards funding new, unique wallets for tests to ensure isolation, rather than strengthening the `*dsl.EOA` abstraction or regulating EOA ownership through a master wallet object.

### Skipping L1 Chain Config for L3s
The need for op-node and op-program to skip L1 chain config for L3s ([#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18070)) was discussed. A suggestion was made to automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID and apply L3 behavior, similar to how L1 mainnet and Sepolia are recognized.
