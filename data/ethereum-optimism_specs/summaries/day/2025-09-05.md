# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Sep 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a key update to the Jovian protocol specifications, explicitly clarifying `PayloadAttributes.MinBaseFee` requirements. Several long-standing issues related to `min-base-fee` and `op-nat` integration were closed, indicating progress in protocol refinement and development environment focus.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Jovian Protocol Specification Refinement
A critical update was made to the Jovian protocol specifications to explicitly require `PayloadAttributes.MinBaseFee` to be `NULL` prior to the Jovian upgrade. This clarifies a specific protocol behavior, addressing a newly identified need for explicitness in the specifications. ([#756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/756))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Min-Base-Fee Specification Clarification
An issue requesting explicit clarification on the `PayloadAttributes.MinBaseFee` requirement pre-Jovian was opened and closed on the same day, indicating a swift resolution and update to the protocol specifications. ([#755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/755))

### Min-Base-Fee Feature Integration
Several issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature were closed, including adding `minBaseFee` to the block header's `extraData` field ([#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/649)), adding an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3` ([#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/650)), and updating `eip1559.CalcBaseFee` to enforce the minimum if the feature is active ([#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/651)). These closures indicate progress in integrating and specifying the `min-base-fee` functionality.

### `op-nat` Kurtosis Integration Deprioritized
The issue concerning running `op-nat` in Kurtosis for network acceptance tests was closed, with the rationale that other local development environments are now being prioritized. ([#158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/158))

## NEW ISSUES

### Jovian Protocol Specification Explicitness
A new issue was opened to explicitly state the requirement for `PayloadAttributes.MinBaseFee` to be `nil` pre-Jovian, highlighting a need for clearer protocol specifications. ([#755](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/755))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-geth` Init with Large Genesis File
Discussion on [#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/668) regarding `op-geth` initialization with a large 7GB genesis file continued. @protolambda provided a detailed explanation, suggesting that the Genesis-State-Spec (the "alloc" part of `genesis.json`) is optional and doesn't need to be stored in `geth`. The recommendation was to modify `op-geth` for one-time state import by not storing the alloc data as a flat JSON blob and to include the `stateHash` attribute of the genesis block into the chain-`config` part of `genesis.json`. This approach aligns with how `op-mainnet` handles large genesis states, enabling fresh nodes to snap-sync from bootstrap nodes. The issue was later closed, with @cliff0412 acknowledging the advice.

### Superchain Configuration Explicitness
On [#763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/763), @alfonso-op inquired whether chain configurations are now fully self-descriptive, questioning if the issue could be closed. This indicates an ongoing effort to ensure `ChainConfig` .toml files contain a complete set of config values, moving away from inherited or populated values within the `superchain` package.
