# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Sep 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the specification of the `SystemConfig.ConfigUpdate` event to improve clarity and remove redundancy. Additionally, several issues were closed, including improvements to op-batcher metrics and a resolution for op-geth initialization with large genesis files.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Specification Refinement
*   Removed repetition and improved naming conventions in the `SystemConfig.ConfigUpdate` event specification within the Holocene and Jovian protocols. This change enhances clarity and maintainability of the protocol documentation. ([#763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/763))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### op-batcher Metric Improvement
*   The `op-batcher` throttling intensity metric was improved by suggesting a Grafana-based solution to only plot values greater than 0, making it easier to visualize active controllers. ([#17149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17149))

### op-geth Genesis File Initialization
*   A panic issue related to `op-geth` initialization with large genesis files was resolved. The solution involves modifying `op-geth` to not store the `alloc` data as a flat JSON blob and instead rely on the `stateHash` attribute for genesis block loading and snap-syncing. ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/668))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis: Local op-geth Build Capability
Discussion on [#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16975) revolves around enabling Kurtosis to use local `op-geth` builds. The latest suggestion proposes leveraging the templating system to automatically override image sources, either by constructing a Docker image URL from the `go.mod` githash or by cloning the source code and building a local Docker image.
