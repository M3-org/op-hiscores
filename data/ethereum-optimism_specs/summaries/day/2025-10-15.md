## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Jovian DA Footprint Limit Specification Update
The DA footprint limit specifications were updated to utilize `blobGasUsed`, and a fix was implemented for the storage location of the DA footprint gas scalar. This change is detailed in [#800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/800).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#799](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/799) regenerate jovian upgrade transactions

## CLOSED ISSUES

### DA Footprint Block Limit Specification Update
The issue concerning the update of DA footprint block limit specifications with the latest design was closed. The resolution involved using the `blobBaseFee` header field for the new gas-like dimension instead of modifying the `gasUsed` field, as implemented via [#800](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/800). This is documented in [#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/792).
