# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on clarifying span batch L1 origin rules within the protocol specifications. Additionally, an issue regarding low batcher throughput was closed, and a new issue concerning `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency was opened and discussed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Protocol Specification Clarifications
*   Clarified the rules for outdated L1 origins in span batches, specifically before and after Holocene, impacting `specs/protocol/delta/span-batches.md` and `specs/protocol/holocene/derivation.md`. This change, while not altering the core batch queue rules, enhances the clarity of existing specifications [#863](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/863).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Batcher Throughput Monitoring and Response
*   A runbook was created to address potential issues with low batcher throughput due to a high `MinBaseFee`, ensuring that alerts are in place and a response plan is documented [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16959).

## NEW ISSUES

### Dispute Game Contract Dependencies
*   An issue was opened to discuss the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency within `AnchorStateRegistry`, specifically regarding the `anchorStateRegistry()` method and its implications for different game types [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18347).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game Contract Dependencies [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18347)
Discussion revolves around the necessity and implications of the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency in `AnchorStateRegistry`. The core problem is that the current setup requires a cast to `IFaultDisputeGame` to check if the `anchorStateRegistry()` from the dispute game matches the `AnchorStateRegistry` itself, which might not work for all game types. There's a debate on whether this sanity check is strictly necessary, given deployment-time checks via `OPStandardValidator`. A suggestion was made to expand the `IDisputeGame` interface to include the `AnchorStateRegistry` method, ensuring the sanity check remains valid across different dispute game implementations.
