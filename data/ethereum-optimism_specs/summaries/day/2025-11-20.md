# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on clarifying span batch L1 origin rules within the protocol specifications. Additionally, an issue related to low batcher throughput was closed, and a new issue concerning `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency was opened and discussed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Protocol Specification Clarification
*   Clarified the rules for outdated L1 origins in span batches, specifically addressing behavior before and after Holocene. This change, while not altering the underlying batch queue rules, enhances the clarity of the specifications [#863](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/863).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Batcher Throughput Monitoring and Response
*   An issue concerning the monitoring and response to low batcher throughput due to a high `MinBaseFee` was closed. A runbook has been created to address this scenario, ensuring proper alerting and response mechanisms are in place [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16959).

## NEW ISSUES

### Dispute Game Contract Dependencies
*   A new issue was opened to address a potential problem with the `AnchorStateRegistry`'s dependency on `IFaultDisputeGame`. The current implementation checks for a matching `anchorStateRegistry()` method via a cast to `IFaultDisputeGame`, which may not be compatible with all dispute game types [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18347).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game Contract Dependencies Discussion
The discussion around [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18347) centers on the `AnchorStateRegistry`'s reliance on the `IFaultDisputeGame` interface. The core problem is that the `AnchorStateRegistry` currently casts to `IFaultDisputeGame` to verify the `anchorStateRegistry()` method, which might not be present in all dispute game implementations.

*   **Proposed Solution:** One suggestion is to expand the `IDisputeGame` interface to explicitly require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method, ensuring consistency across dispute game types.
*   **Sanity Check Justification:** There's debate on the necessity of this specific sanity check. While it ensures the reported `AnchorStateRegistry` matches, it's questioned if this check is truly effective given existing deployment-time checks via `OPStandardValidator`. It's also noted that adding `wasRespectedAtGameCreation` already ties dispute game implementations to the `AnchorStateRegistry`, potentially making the current issue less critical.
