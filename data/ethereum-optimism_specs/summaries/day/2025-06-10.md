# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Jun 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on documentation updates within the fault-proof specifications, specifically updating the list of Fault Proof Virtual Machines.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Fault Proof VM Documentation
Documentation for fault-proof virtual machines was updated to reflect changes in VM status. Specifically, "Cannon" is now listed as 64-bit, and "cannon-rs" is marked as deprecated. This update is part of ongoing efforts to maintain accurate and current specifications for the fault-proof system. ([#720](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/720))

### Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes
Discussion on [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15789) continues regarding necessary OPCM changes for the Fault Proof creator contract to support recent updates. The latest comment from stevennevins outlines a comprehensive list of tasks, including moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, removing `anchorStateRegistry` from `StandardValidatorOverrides`, unskipping and updating tests in `DeployOPChain.t.sol`, reviewing comment responses, addressing TODOs flagged by Adrian, and rebasing updates from EVM safety refactoring. A link to a related pull request in the `optimism` repository ([#16340](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16340)) was also provided.

### op-supervisor: Event overflow on large unsafe head gap
The issue [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16335) addresses a critical problem where the `op-supervisor` can crash-loop due to an event overflow when the unsafe head gap between its log DB and a managed node becomes too large. The discussion on June 10th included axelKingsley clarifying that `ChainIndexingContinueEvent`s do not stack up and are a response to `ChainProcess` events, indicating a 1:1 emit:consume ratio for indexing events. This suggests that other event types might be causing the queue-depth issue. Later comments (June 17th) from nonsense and sebastianst further explore the possibility of other event types, such as `"cross-unsafe-update"` events, stacking up. Nonsense is working on adding a counter per event type to aid in future debugging, with a PR ([#16471](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16471)) in progress.
