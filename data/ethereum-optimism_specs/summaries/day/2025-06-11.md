## NEW ISSUES

*   **Acceptance Test Reliability**
    *   An issue was opened to improve the reliability of acceptance tests, aiming for consistent 1-shot 100% pass rates instead of K-shot passes ([#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16378)).
*   **Supervisor Mode Renaming**
    *   A ticket was created to rename supervisor and op-node modes to improve clarity and reduce confusion, following a new naming convention ([#16379](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16379)).
*   **Gas Tank Contract**
    *   An issue was opened to track the development and integration of a Gas Tank contract ([#836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/836)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Improve reliability of acceptance tests** ([#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16378))
    The discussion highlights ongoing efforts to identify and resolve flakiness in acceptance tests. Recent comments indicate that `op-acceptance-tests/tests/interop/reorgs` package passes with `-count=5`, suggesting it's not currently actionable. The `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` also passes with `-count=5`. The focus is shifting to `op-acceptance-tests/tests/interop/sync/multisupervisor_interop` as a potential source of flakiness, specifically `TestUnsafeChainUnknownToL2CL` and `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor`. There's an emphasis on measuring flakiness by package rather than individual test, as shared environments can influence results. A "Flakiness Report" has been introduced to provide more insights, including job names to pinpoint flakiness origins. The issue was later closed on July 9, 2025, with a note that tests have been considerably improved, and continuous monitoring and improvement are needed.

*   **interop: supervisor <> op-node mode renaming** ([#16379](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16379))
    The discussion confirms the renaming initiative to clarify supervisor and op-node modes. A comment points out a potential mix-up in the naming convention, specifically regarding the replacement of "standard mode" with "indexing mode" and the renaming of "managed mode" to "indexing mode," indicating a need for careful implementation to avoid further confusion.

*   **Gas Tank contract** ([#836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/836))
    A pull request for the Gas Tank contract has been linked, indicating active development on this feature.
