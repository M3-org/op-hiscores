## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Code Style and Semgrep Rule for Function Naming**
Issue [#15115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15115) discusses adding a semgrep rule to enforce naming conventions for private/internal functions (starting with an underscore) and public functions (not starting with an underscore). The latest comment from `copilot-swe-agent` indicates an error due to GitHub Actions being disabled for the repository, preventing automated work on the issue.

**Test Target Setup and Teardown Integration**
Issue [#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/375) addresses the need to incorporate test target setup/teardown as an `op-acceptor` concern to improve compatibility of acceptance tests across various test target networks (e.g., sysgo, kurtosis, devnet). The latest comment from `scharissis` links to related pull requests in other repositories, suggesting ongoing work or discussions around this integration.
