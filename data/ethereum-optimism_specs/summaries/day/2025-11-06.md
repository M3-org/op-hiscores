# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Nov 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on documentation, specifically detailing Jovian precompile input size restrictions. Discussions continued on critical issues including Go 1.25 compatibility for Cannon and `op-batcher` synchronization with `op-node` rollup configurations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Jovian Hard Fork Documentation
Documentation was updated to reflect input size restrictions for precompiles introduced in the upcoming Jovian hard fork, providing clarity on protocol changes. ([#849](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/849))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kona + Cannon Audit
The issue concerning the audit of OPCM changes for Kona and Cannon was closed, as it is now covered by a related issue in the `optimism` repository. ([#17371](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17371))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility
Discussion continued on the `cannon: Support go1.25` issue, with the latest comment confirming a fix in Go 1.25.4 for the blocking MIPS issue. Earlier comments highlighted that all keccak hashes were incorrect when running in Cannon with Go 1.25, impacting block hash calculations. ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17060))

### op-batcher AltDA Frame Size
The `op-batcher [altda]: should not limit max frame size to max input size in generic mode` issue saw an update, with a comment indicating that the problem was addressed in a pull request in the `optimism` repository, and questioning if the issue can now be closed. ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17796))

### op-sync-tester Jovian Support
A new pull request was made to address the `op-sync-tester: Support Jovian` issue, aiming to patch the Sync Tester for Jovian compatibility and add relevant hard fork tests. ([#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18126))

### op-batcher Rollup Config Synchronization
The `op-batcher: stay in sync with op-node rollup config` issue saw further discussion. The latest comments explored the idea of the operator explicitly providing the rollup configuration to the batcher to ensure consistency, rather than relying on the batcher fetching it once at startup. This approach could simplify dependency management but might require new batcher releases for each Superchain Registry config change. ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18178))
