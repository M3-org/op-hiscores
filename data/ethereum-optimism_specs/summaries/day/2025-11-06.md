# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Nov 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on documentation, specifically detailing Jovian precompile input size restrictions. Discussions continued on several active issues, including Go 1.25 compatibility for Cannon and `op-batcher` synchronization with `op-node` rollup configurations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation of Jovian Hard Fork Changes
A new pull request was merged to document the input size restrictions for precompiles introduced in the Jovian hard fork, providing crucial details for upcoming protocol changes.
- Document Jovian precompile input size restrictions ([#849](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/849))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kona + Cannon Audit
The issue concerning the audit of OPCM changes for Kona and Cannon was closed, as its scope is now covered by a related issue in the `optimism` repository.
- Kona + Cannon: Audit OPCM changes ([#17371](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17371))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility
Discussions on [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17060) continued regarding Cannon's compatibility with Go 1.25. The latest comment confirms that the issue, which caused incorrect keccak hashes and potentially other crypto problems, has been fixed in Go 1.25.4. Previous comments highlighted the impact on Cannon's ability to calculate block hashes correctly and the underlying Go issue.

### op-batcher AltDA Frame Size Limit
Issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17796) discusses the `op-batcher`'s max frame size in generic mode for altDA. A recent comment from `nuke-web3` suggests updating the spec to reflect that the `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` limit for input data is no longer applicable in generic commitment mode, as the current spec contains a false statement. `tessr` noted that the issue was addressed in a pull request in the `optimism` repository and questioned if the issue could be closed.

### op-batcher Rollup Config Synchronization
The discussion on [#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18178) revolves around the `op-batcher`'s static rollup configuration after startup. `sebastianst` liked the idea of the operator providing the rollup config to the batcher, noting that for Superchain Registry chains, the batcher could query the chain ID and load the config. However, this would necessitate a new batcher release for each SR config change. `joshklop` also supported the idea of the operator providing the config to make the dependency explicit and avoid potential concurrency issues.

### op-sync-tester Jovian Support
On issue [#18126](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18126), `CreeptoGengar` reported creating a pull request aimed at patching the Sync Tester to support the Jovian hard fork and add relevant tests.
