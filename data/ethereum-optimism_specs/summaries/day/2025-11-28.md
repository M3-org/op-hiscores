## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Deployment Configuration for Fault Game Parameters**
    *   Issue [#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18407) discusses an `op deployer` revert when using custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values.
    *   The core problem was identified as a validation check in the `FaultDisputeGame.sol` contract, requiring `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` to be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration`.
    *   The latest comment confirms that overriding `PreimageOracleChallengePeriod` resolved the issue for testnets, indicating the validation was indeed the cause of the revert.
