## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Deployment Configuration Validation
An issue regarding `op deployer` reverting with custom `faultGameClockExtension` and `faultGameMaxClockDuration` values was closed. The problem was identified as a validation constraint requiring `preimageOracleChallengePeriod + faultGameClockExtension` to be less than `faultGameMaxClockDuration`. The user confirmed that overriding `PreimageOracleChallengePeriod` resolved the issue for testnets. ([#18407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18407))
