# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Sep 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant activity in issue resolution, particularly around Kurtosis devnet improvements and infrastructure threat modeling. Several long-standing Kurtosis-related issues were closed, indicating a shift in focus or completion of planned work in that area. A new issue was opened to enhance op-program's block header oracle lookup.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

- No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kurtosis Devnet Refinement and Deprioritization
Several issues related to the Kurtosis devnet were closed, largely due to completion or a decision not to implement further features. This includes adding genesis checks to the optimism-package [#15753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15753), improving Kurtosis idempotency and performance [#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/14390), extracting/mapping L1 chain configuration [#15050](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15050), creating tests for proxyd [#15558](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15558), adding a rotatory welcome message [#15511](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15511), investigating selective service selection [#15537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15537), and adding Kurtosis support to op-validator [#16712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16712).

### Builder Address Funding Tracking
An issue tracking funded builder addresses for OP Stack use, testing, or builder onboarding was closed [#762](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/762). This issue documented a specific funding event for the "Titan builder" with 64 ETH.

### Infrastructure Threat Modeling
An issue concerning infrastructure threat modeling related to flashblocks delivery was closed [#17144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17144). The discussion concluded that while improvements are needed for reliability and security in building and delivering flashblocks container images, there is no novel risk beyond what is already accepted for other images. The short-term mitigation involves hardcoding image digests in Kubernetes deployment manifests.

### Dispute Game Implementation Update
An issue to use v2 dispute game implementations in OPCM.addGameType was closed as a duplicate [#17259](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17259).

## NEW ISSUES

### Op-Program Block Header Oracle Enhancement
A new issue was opened to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in op-program and specs [#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17416). This aims to provide key information for looking up a block hash by number.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis Idempotency / Performance [#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/14390)
This issue, though closed today, had extensive prior discussion. The latest comments from `alfonso-op` indicate that the issue is largely (if not fully) completed and is being closed as Kurtosis is not currently a priority. Earlier discussions highlighted significant improvements in devnet provisioning times, with a "noop" deployment taking around 30 seconds after initial setup. There was also a point about the time taken to build prestates (around 4 minutes) and contracts (30 seconds), with a suggestion to use native builds for prestates for faster local development. The discussion also touched upon Docker Desktop performance issues on Mac after sleep/wake cycles and the need for faster failure detection in Kurtosis for API mismatches.

### Implement Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17194)
This issue was closed today with a comment from `alfonso-op` stating it won't be implemented. However, `ajsutton` reopened it, noting a `TODO` in the code that references this issue. The latest comment suggests that if the feature is no longer planned, the `TODO` should be removed from the code.
