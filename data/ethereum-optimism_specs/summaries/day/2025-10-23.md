# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day focused on enhancing documentation for experimental contracts, with specifications created for `ResolvedDelegateProxy` and `LegacyMintableERC20`. Several new pull requests were opened to further document experimental contracts.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation of Legacy Experimental Contracts
Significant progress was made in documenting legacy experimental contracts within the `specs/experimental` directory. This includes creating comprehensive specifications for the `ResolvedDelegateProxy` and `LegacyMintableERC20` contracts, ensuring their details are captured in the canonical OP Stack specification format.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### OPCM Game Type Retrieval Update
The issue concerning forwards-compatible gameType retrieval in OPCM has been closed. It was determined that the necessary updates were handled as part of other work, with OPCM and standard validator now only calling `gameType()` for V1 contracts or within feature toggle checks.
