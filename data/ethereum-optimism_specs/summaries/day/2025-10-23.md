# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused heavily on documentation, with two new comprehensive specifications for legacy contracts being added. Several new pull requests were opened, primarily for additional contract specifications, indicating a strong push towards thorough documentation of the experimental contracts.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Legacy Contract Specification
*   Comprehensive specifications for the `ResolvedDelegateProxy` ([#812](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/812)) and `LegacyMintableERC20` ([#815](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/815)) contracts were created, detailing their functionality and purpose within the OP Stack.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Seven new pull requests were opened today, all focusing on creating specifications for various experimental contracts:
*   [#820](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/820) docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create LivenessGuard specification
*   [#819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/819) docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create DelayedWETH specification
*   [#818](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/818) docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create SafeSigners specification
*   [#817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/817) docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create DeployerWhitelist specification
*   [#816](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/816) docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create StorageSetter specification
*   [#814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/814) docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create SaferSafes specification
*   [#813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/813) docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create PreimageKeyLib specification

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flaky Test Investigation
Discussion continues on the flaky test `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17966)). The latest comment from @geoknee indicates difficulty in reproducing the failure locally and requests links to existing failures for further investigation.

### OPCM GameType Retrieval
The issue regarding forwards-compatible `gameType` retrieval in OPCM ([#17933](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17933)) was closed today. The discussion concluded that the necessary changes were implicitly handled as part of other work, and current `gameType()` calls in OPCM and standard validator are now specifically for V1 contracts or guarded by feature toggles.
