# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Jun 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in addressing CI flakiness and refining internal processes. Several long-standing issues were closed, including discussions on CI SLAs and documentation improvements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### CI/Testing Improvements
Discussions around CI flakiness and the implementation of CI SLAs were concluded. While a formal SLA framework will not be adopted for now, efforts to improve test stability and reporting continue. This includes the release of a test flake report generator and ongoing monitoring of flakiness. ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16271), [#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16437))

### Documentation and Developer Tooling
An issue regarding the documentation for bridging ERC-20 tokens with Viem was closed, indicating that the necessary updates have been completed. A feature request to enable deterministic gas testing by setting a fixed base fee was also closed, with the understanding that adapting tests to query the `baseFee` is a more suitable approach. ([#1508](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1508), [#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/408))

### Acceptance Test Porting
A request to port `TestWithdrawalsRoot` to devstack was closed, as the implementation has been completed. ([#412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/412))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI Flakiness Investigation
Issue [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16271) concerning CI flakiness was closed today. The latest comment from scharissis confirms that a test flake report generator has been released and iterated upon, and test flakiness has improved. Monitoring will continue.

### op-node Goroutine Issues
Issue [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16332) reports `op-node` (v1.13.3) getting stuck with thousands of goroutines, leading to sync issues. The latest comments from rrrengineer and Creamers158 confirm that they are experiencing the same problem on v1.13.3.

### CI SLAs Spike
Issue [#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16437) explored the adoption of internal SLAs for the continuous integration pipeline. The issue was closed today, with scharissis stating that CI SLAs will not be implemented for now. Recent comments from pauldowman and teddyknox provided feedback on the proposed SLAs, with ajsutton expressing skepticism about their direct impact on developers but acknowledging their potential usefulness for the platforms team. The discussion highlighted the importance of addressing flaky tests and potentially improving how new tests are admitted to the repository.
