## NEW ISSUES
### Min-Base-Fee State Growth Estimation
A new issue was opened to add a state growth estimate to the FMA for the `min-base-fee` feature [#316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/316). This includes a napkin math calculation estimating 16MB of state growth per year.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-test-sequencer` Integration
Discussion continued on the integration of `op-test-sequencer` into the devnet environment and Kurtosis [#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15265). A recent comment highlighted that this integration is required to run reorg tests in the `kona-supervisor` devstack environment. Previously, the issue was re-opened due to a `todo` in the code, after being deprioritized pending use-cases for testing.

### `min-base-fee` Specification
Discussion on the `min-base-fee` specification [#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/742) included a decision to move the state growth estimate to the FMA, with tracking for this now occurring in a separate issue. Initially, there was a request to compute a rough estimate for the state growth implied by this feature to be included in the motivation section of the specs.
