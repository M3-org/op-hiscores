# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused heavily on documentation, with significant progress made in specifying various legacy and experimental contracts. Additionally, several issues related to the Jovian upgrade and internal tooling were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Comprehensive Contract Specification Documentation
Extensive documentation was added for several key contracts, including the `L1BlockNumber` predeploy, `AddressManager`, `LegacyMessagePasser`, and a unified `FeeVault` specification. This effort aims to provide clear and comprehensive specifications for both legacy and experimental contracts within the OP Stack.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game Contract Updates
Discussion on [#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17267) regarding updating `OPCMStandardValidator` for new dispute game contracts saw a brief closure and subsequent reopening. The issue was initially closed as completed but reopened because tests are still skipped when V2 is enabled, indicating further work is needed.

### Interopgen Configuration Rewiring
Issue [#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17614) concerning rewiring the interopgen config was closed as "won't fix." The rationale is that interopgen is primarily used by `op-e2e`, and new tests are now added as acceptance tests, negating the need for further configuration.

### DA Footprint Limit Investigation
On [#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17946), an investigation into why the block right after genesis still has a 0 gas scalar revealed that the issue was caused by how the first block's L1 block attributes were populated from the genesis SystemConfig. A fix has been implemented in #17947.
