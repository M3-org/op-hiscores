# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on significant documentation enhancements, particularly in specifying legacy and experimental contracts, alongside finalizing Jovian upgrade transactions. Several long-standing issues related to validation and Kurtosis tooling were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Comprehensive Specification of Legacy and Experimental Contracts
Extensive documentation was added for various legacy and experimental contracts, providing detailed specifications for components like the L1BlockNumber predeploy, AddressManager, and the unified FeeVault. This work aims to improve clarity and understanding of core Optimism contracts.

- [#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/773)

### Deprecation of Kurtosis and Discord Faucet
Issues concerning Kurtosis's ability to use local `op-geth` builds and the need for a Sepolia ETH faucet in the Protocol R&D Discord were closed, indicating a shift away from these tools and platforms.
- [#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16975)
- [#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/12952)

### Validation Process Refinements
Several issues related to chain validation processes were closed, reflecting a move towards a report-based approach for chain validation and away from strict blocking validations.
- [#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/689)
- [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/696)

### Dispute Game Contract Updates
An issue regarding the `OPCMStandardValidator` handling new dispute game contracts was closed, with a note that it was addressed in linked PRs, though it was later reopened due to skipped tests. Another issue to rewire `interopgen` config was closed as "won't fix" due to its limited use.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Investigation
Issue [#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17946) is investigating why block 1 after genesis still has a 0 gas scalar, despite the expectation of a default scalar. A cause has been identified related to how the first block's L1 block attributes were populated from the genesis SystemConfig, and a fix is in progress.
