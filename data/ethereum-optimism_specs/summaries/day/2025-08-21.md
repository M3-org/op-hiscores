# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Aug 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining supervisor data availability error codes and linking RPC error codes within the `specs/interop` directory. Several long-standing issues related to proofs interop acceptance testing and event system cleanup were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Supervisor Interoperability Enhancements
Work continued on improving the clarity and structure of supervisor-related specifications. This included refactoring data availability error codes to align with ongoing efforts towards a specific issue ([#724](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/724)) and linking supervisor RPC error codes to the contents section for better navigation and reference ([#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/685)). These changes primarily affected the `specs/interop/supervisor.md` file.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Proofs Interoperability Acceptance Testing Completed
Significant progress was made in the area of proofs interoperability. The umbrella issue for "proofs: Interop Acceptance Testing" ([#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15946)) was closed as all sub-issues were completed. Specifically, the "op-challenger acceptance tests on interop" issue ([#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15948)) was also closed, indicating that acceptance tests for op-challenger functionality on interop chains are now in place.

### Event System Cleanup
Two events were successfully removed from the event system ([#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17001)), with associated pull requests already merged in the `optimism` repository.

### Test Target Setup Refinement
The issue concerning the incorporation of test target setup/teardown as an `op-acceptor` concern ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/375)) was closed. The rationale for closing was that Kurtosis is no longer considered as important for network testing compared to Sysgo.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Contract Verification Improvements
The discussion around "contract verification improvements" ([#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/14813)) saw a recent comment from `bitwiseguy` on August 21, 2025. The suggestion is to revisit `op-deployer` contract verification once `forge` binary support is implemented, allowing for shelling out to `forge verify-contract` for verification against Etherscan and Blockscout. This approach aims to reduce custom verification code by leveraging `forge`'s capabilities. Earlier comments also suggested considering Sourcify for verification.
