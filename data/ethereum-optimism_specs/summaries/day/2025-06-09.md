## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI Flakiness Investigation
Discussions continued on investigating and improving CI flakiness [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16271). A comment from scharissis on June 9th highlighted that most flakiness is due to infrastructure issues (CircleCI machine issues, networking) rather than acceptance testing itself. A list of the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests was also provided.

### op-supervisor L1 Origin Validity
Discussion on improving L1 origin validity handling during op-supervisor resets [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16315) saw a comment from sebastianst on June 9th. The comment suggested that the supervisor should only provide valid targets and that duplicating validity checks and walkbacks on the op-node should be avoided, simplifying the process.

### Incorrect Nonce from eth_getTransactionCount
An ongoing issue regarding `eth_getTransactionCount` returning an incorrect nonce [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/623) received a comment from ntrzr on June 9th, requesting an update on the issue.

### Superchain Interop Quickstart Guide
Discussions continued on creating a quickstart guide for the Superchain Interop environment [#1644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1644). On June 9th, krofax committed to drafting the guide by tomorrow, and sbvegan noted that the team is exploring this content for a potential homepage, taking a wider lens.

### Complete Withdrawal Flow Test
Progress was noted on the "Complete Withdrawal Flow Test" [#327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/327). On June 9th, serpixel confirmed that the test has been implemented (sysgo) in [#16333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16333), with two follow-up tickets planned for adding `kt` support and executing withdrawals without proof in devnet.
