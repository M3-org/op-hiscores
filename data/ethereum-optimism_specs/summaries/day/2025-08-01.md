### Min Base Fee Tracking and Specification
Discussions on the Min Base Fee tracking issue ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16807)) continued, with wlawt sharing an early reth draft ([https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/17704](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/17704)) for early feedback. wlawt also highlighted other related in-flight work, including op-alloy ([https://github.com/alloy-rs/op-alloy/pull/580](https://github.com/alloy-rs/op-alloy/pull/580)) and optimism ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16852)) repositories.

On the related issue to write the min-base-fee specification ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/742)), geoknee commented on the need to compute a rough estimate for the state growth implied by this feature, suggesting its inclusion in the motivation section of the specs. This estimate was later decided to be better placed in the FMA, with tracking noted in a design-docs issue ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/316](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/issues/316)).
