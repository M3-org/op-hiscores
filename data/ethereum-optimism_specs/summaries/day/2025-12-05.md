## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Node Synchronization Challenges
*   Issue [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18510) discusses problems with `op-node` v1.16.3 failing to synchronize after an upgrade. The latest comment from `geoknee` requests more detailed logs and metrics, and suggests upgrading `op-geth` to v1.101603.5, noting that the observed log line is not uncommon after an `op-node` restart.

### Development and Testing Infrastructure
*   Issue [#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18482) proposes creating a new `op-spammer` component for devnet deployments to catch bugs related to user transactions. `geoknee` suggested that existing "prior art" from `flashbots/contender` might be sufficient, a point further elaborated by `scharissis` who specifically referenced an issue within `flashbots/contender`.
*   Issue [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16450) addresses the need for `sysgo` to support flashblocks/rbuiders for `op-acceptance-tests`. `geoknee` inquired if the task is completed, following up on `teddyknox`'s earlier comment about needing this for `kona-node` and `rollup-boost` validation.
