## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-acceptance-tests` Enhancements
- Discussion continued on the need for `sysgo` to support flashblocks/rbuiders for `op-acceptance-tests` ([#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16450)). The latest comment from @geoknee asks for an update on its completion, following @teddyknox's earlier comment about its importance for validating `kona-node` and `rollup-boost` changes.

### `op-spammer` Component Development
- The issue of creating a new `op-spammer` component for devnet deployments is being discussed ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18482)). @geoknee suggested that existing "prior art" like `flashbots/contender` might be sufficient.

### `op-node` Synchronization Problems
- An issue was opened regarding `op-node` v1.16.3 failing to synchronize for Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18510)). @J1a-wei provided details on the specific `op-geth` and `op-node` image versions being used.
