# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Sep 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on minor documentation corrections within the `specs/protocol` directory, specifically addressing typos and refining attribute descriptions. Discussions continued on existing issues, including flakiness in acceptance tests and clarifications regarding token bridging.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Refinements in Protocol Specifications
Minor corrections were made to the protocol specifications. A typo was fixed in the Jovian system-config documentation ([#768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/768)), and the `operatorFee` attributes in the Isthmus l1-attributes documentation were revised for clarity ([#774](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/774)).

### Addressing Flakiness in Acceptance Tests
Discussion continued on [#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17298) regarding the flakiness of `TestPreNoInbox` in `op-acceptance-tests`. A recent comment from pcw109550 indicated that a previous attempt to fix the issue in `optimism/pull/17495` was unsuccessful, following an earlier report of another flake by scharissis.

### Clarification on Token Bridging
Issue [#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1203) saw further discussion regarding a token bridging problem. AlexBHarley clarified that the token in question is likely not an `OptimismMintableERC20`, which would explain why the generated entry does not include a bridge address. The next step suggested is to verify the implementation.

### Cleaning Up Protocol System Configuration
Discussion on [#771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/771) focused on improving the `protocol/system-config.md` document. joshklop referenced a suggestion from @sebastianst to specify both the number and canonical name for config update enums (e.g., `MIN_BASE_FEE` and `6`), and to consider linking to fork-specific specs for updates added by hard forks.
