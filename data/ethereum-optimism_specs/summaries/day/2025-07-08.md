# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Jul 8, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining interoperation specifications within the Superchain, specifically by adding a new derivation type and extending block reference functionality for improved L2 block origin tracking.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Interoperability Specification Enhancements
Improvements were made to the `specs/interop/managed-node.md` file to enhance cross-chain interoperability within the Superchain. This includes the addition of `DerivationCurrentL1Update` to support ongoing discussions and the extension of `interop_blockRefByNumber` to `interop_l2BlockRefByNumber` to ensure the supervisor can accurately determine the L1 origin of L2 blocks.

### Clarification on Precompile Address Initialization
Discussion continued on the initialization of addresses 0x00-0xff in the op-stack. The latest comment clarifies that these are precompile addresses, and the 1 wei balance is a standard practice due to rules concerning empty accounts, indicating that this initialization is intentional and serves a specific purpose.
