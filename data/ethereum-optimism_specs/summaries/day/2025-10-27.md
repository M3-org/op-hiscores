# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in documenting core Optimism contracts, with multiple new specifications added for L1 and L2 bridges, ERC721 tokens, and the LivenessModule.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Comprehensive L2 Contract Specifications
New specifications were added for several critical L2 contracts, including `OptimismMintableERC721Factory` and `OptimismMintableERC721`, detailing their functionalities for bridging and representing L1 ERC721 tokens on L2. The `L2ERC721Bridge` specification was also created, outlining the L2 side of ERC721 token transfers. ([#833](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/833), [#832](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/832), [#831](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/831))

### L1 Bridge and Module Documentation
A comprehensive specification for the `L1ERC721Bridge` was introduced, detailing its role in enabling trustless ERC721 transfers between Ethereum L1 and Optimism. Additionally, the `LivenessModule` received a new specification, outlining its function within the OP Stack. ([#830](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/830), [#828](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/828))

### Dispute Game Factory Specification
A new specification for the `DisputeGameFactory` contract was added, which serves as the central registry and factory for creating dispute game contracts within the OP Stack. ([#829](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/829))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Four new pull requests were opened, all focused on creating the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` specification:
- [#837](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/837) docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create L2CrossDomainMessenger specification
- [#836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/836) docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create L2CrossDomainMessenger specification
- [#835](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/835) docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create L2CrossDomainMessenger specification
- [#834](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/834) docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create L2CrossDomainMessenger specification

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Enhanced Testing for op-deployer
The issue concerning the need for more end-to-end testing for `op-deployer` was closed. This was due to the recent introduction of many new CLI-level integration tests, which address the initial concern. ([#16842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16842))
