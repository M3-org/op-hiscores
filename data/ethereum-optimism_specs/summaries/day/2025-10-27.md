# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused heavily on expanding the documentation for various Optimism contracts, including LivenessModule, OptimismMintableERC721Factory, OptimismMintableERC721, L2ERC721Bridge, and L1ERC721Bridge. A specification for the DisputeGameFactory was also added.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Comprehensive Contract Specifications
Significant progress was made in documenting core Optimism contracts. New specifications were added for the `LivenessModule` ([#828](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/828)), `OptimismMintableERC721Factory` ([#833](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/833)), and `OptimismMintableERC721` ([#832](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/832)). These specifications follow the canonical OP Stack format, providing detailed documentation for these critical components.

### Bridging Contract Documentation
Specifications for the `L2ERC721Bridge` ([#831](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/831)) and `L1ERC721Bridge` ([#830](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/830)) were created. These documents detail the mechanisms for trustless ERC721 token transfers between Ethereum L1 and Optimism L2.

### Dispute Game Factory Specification
A comprehensive specification for the `DisputeGameFactory` contract was added ([#829](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/829)). This document outlines the role of the factory as the central registry and creator of dispute game contracts within the OP Stack.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Three new pull requests were opened today, all focusing on creating the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` specification:
- [#836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/836) docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create L2CrossDomainMessenger specification
- [#835](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/835) docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create L2CrossDomainMessenger specification
- [#834](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/834) docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create L2CrossDomainMessenger specification

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Enhanced Testing for op-deployer
Issue [#16842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16842), which aimed to implement more end-to-end tests for `op-deployer` to prevent bugs and check full user flows, was closed. The closure was due to the recent introduction of many new CLI-level integration tests, addressing the concerns raised in the issue.
