## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Interop: Evaluating and Reworking Injected Replacement Transactions**
Discussions on [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18574) centered on simplifying the interop spec by potentially removing the additional replacement transaction. @ajsutton highlighted the importance of the additional transaction for the proofs system, especially for the fault dispute game, to avoid overwhelming honest challengers. However, @Inphi and @axelKingsley suggested that the Supernode should be able to generate the necessary data for proofs without an extra deposit transaction, leading to a consensus to simplify the protocol. The next steps involve assigning someone to architecturally refactor this mechanism and updating the Interop specification.

**Node Synchronization Issues**
Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18581) continues to see active discussion regarding "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. @rdin777 provided troubleshooting steps, suggesting the issue might stem from an incomplete or corrupted state database, and requested more information on the user's setup (full vs. archive node, unclean shutdowns, execution client). @yaki-1337 confirmed using a full node with OP-GETH and no improper shutdowns, and inquired about switching to Reth or obtaining new OP-GETH snapshots.

**SPIKE: Reworking Proofs Action Testing to Support Supernodes**
On [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18621), the discussion revolved around adapting proof action testing for the Supernode architecture. @ajsutton emphasized the need for tests to run against a "real" Supernode, especially for challenger tests, to accurately validate the interaction between the challenger and Supernode. @Inphi acknowledged that while action tests might be overkill for testing just the proof program, they could be crucial for testing `op-challenger` in interop scenarios, particularly for generating complex scenarios or data for test setup.

**Use File-Relative Paths Instead of Project-Relative**
The discussion on [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/10202) saw a recent comment from @manu-qiro confirming that "context aware remappings" solved the issue for them, referencing a previous suggestion by @alexkeating. This indicates a potential solution for the problem of project-relative paths causing import failures in various environments.
