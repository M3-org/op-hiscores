# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on a new pull request to add syscalls to the Cannon spec, and ongoing discussions around interop transaction handling, node synchronization issues, and testing strategies for Supernodes.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#869](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/869), was opened to add `getrandom`, `eventfd2` syscalls, and `eventfd` file descriptor to the Cannon specification.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation of Cannon-Kona Prestate Requirement
Issue [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18095), concerning the documentation of the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades, was closed as completed.

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx
Discussion on [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18574) continues regarding the handling of invalid interop transactions and replacement blocks. The latest comments from @ajsutton highlight the downsides of the supernode just recording data, specifically concerning consensus checks and data availability. He notes that while these are not showstoppers currently, they become less of a concern with ZK proofs. @rdin777 summarized a consensus to simplify the protocol by eliminating the additional deposit transaction for proofs and suggested assigning someone for architectural refactoring and updating the Interop specification.

### Node Synchronization Issues
On issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18581), @yaki-1337 reported a "missing trie node" error and asked for guidance on downloading OP-GETH or switching to Reth. @rdin777 suggested that the error indicates an incomplete or corrupted state database and asked for clarification on the node type (full/archive), shutdown history, and execution client used.

### SPIKE: Rework Proofs Action Testing to Support Supernodes
The discussion on [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18621) revolves around adapting proofs action testing for the Supernode architecture. @ajsutton emphasized the importance of testing the interaction between the challenger and Supernode with a real Supernode implementation, especially for challenger tests. @Inphi noted that while action tests might be overkill for testing only the proof program, they might be necessary for testing `op-challenger` for interop, given the intrusiveness required to generate scenarios for the super STF.

### Use File-Relative Paths Instead of Project-Relative
On issue [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/10202), @manu-qiro confirmed that context-aware remappings, as suggested by @alexkeating, resolved their issue with project-relative paths. @alexkeating had previously provided an example of remappings that could solve the compilation problem.
