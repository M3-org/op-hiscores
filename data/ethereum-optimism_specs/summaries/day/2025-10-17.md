# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on regenerating Jovian upgrade transactions from a commit with all features present, impacting derivation specifications and static bytecode. Discussions continued on critical `op-batcher` issues, including Fusaka activation and ensuring proper shutdown behavior.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Jovian Upgrade Transaction Regeneration
Jovian upgrade transactions were regenerated from a commit containing all features, affecting the `jovian.sh` script, the `derivation.md` protocol specification, and the `jovian-l1-block-deployment.txt` static bytecode file ([#799](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/799)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher: prepare for Fusaka ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17472))
The issue was reopened to cover releasing a new batcher version that will automatically switch to cell proofs and include the mainnet Fusaka activation time baked in via `op-service` / `op-geth`. Previously, a recipe for manual testing against a Fusaka L1 was provided.

### op-batcher: ensure full shutdown when "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" ([#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17768))
The latest thinking is to maintain the current detection logic for the "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" error. Instead of introducing a new metric or log, the focus is on ensuring the entire `op-batcher` process exits upon this error, rather than just stopping a part of it. This would allow the batcher to enter a crash loop and automatically recover once the `SetMaxDASize` RPC method becomes available again.
