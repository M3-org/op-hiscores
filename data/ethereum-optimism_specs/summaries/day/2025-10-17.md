# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on regenerating Jovian upgrade transactions from a commit with all features present, impacting derivation specifications and static bytecode. Discussions continued on critical `op-batcher` issues, including Fusaka activation and ensuring full shutdown on RPC unavailability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Jovian Upgrade Transaction Regeneration
*   Regenerated Jovian upgrade transactions from a commit with all features present, impacting `scripts/upgrades/jovian.sh`, `specs/protocol/jovian/derivation.md`, and `specs/static/bytecode/jovian-l1-block-deployment.txt` ([#799](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/799)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher: prepare for Fusaka ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17472))
Discussion on this issue, which addresses the `op-batcher`'s need to switch to sending blob transactions with cell proofs instead of blob proofs when Fusaka activates on L1, was re-opened. The latest comment emphasizes the need for a new batcher version that includes auto-switching to cell proofs and has the mainnet Fusaka activation time baked in via `op-service / op-geth`.

### op-batcher: ensure full shutdown when "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" ([#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17768))
The latest thinking on this issue, which concerns the `op-batcher`'s failure to fully shut down when the "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" error occurs, suggests maintaining the current detection logic. Instead of introducing a new metric or log, the focus is on ensuring the shutdown exits the entire process. This would allow the batcher to enter a crashloop and automatically recover when the `SetMaxDASize` RPC method becomes available again.
