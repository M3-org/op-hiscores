# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Nov 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in documentation, particularly with the creation of new contract specifications and improvements to existing ones, alongside a key refactoring of OptimismPortal function specifications.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Contract Specifications
New comprehensive specifications were added for key components including the `GovernanceToken` ([#848](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/848)), `MIPS64` ([#847](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/847)), and `FaultDisputeGame` ([#846](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/846)) contracts, improving clarity and understanding of these critical parts of the system. The `SuperFaultDisputeGame` variant was also added to the `FaultDisputeGame` specification ([#852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/852)).

### Specification Quality Improvements
A systematic effort was made to improve the quality of experimental contract specifications, addressing various issues across 31 different specifications ([#854](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/854)). This work ensures consistency and accuracy in the documentation.

### OptimismPortal Refactoring and Documentation Structure
The `OptimismPortal` function specifications were cleaned up to accurately reflect the current `OptimismPortal2.sol` contract ([#853](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/853)). Additionally, a structural change moved specifications from the root directory to a dedicated `/specs` folder ([#851](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/851)), improving organization.

### Configurability Documentation Update
New parameters were added to the configurability documentation, deferring to the Superchain registry TOML files to avoid duplicate sources of truth and allow for future governance updates ([#850](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/850)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Configurability Parameter Resolution
The issue regarding the interaction of `daFootprintGasScalar` and `minBaseFee` with the standard configuration was closed ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/770)). This was resolved by deferring to the Superchain registry TOML files, which can be updated via governance votes, thus avoiding multiple sources of truth.

### Acceptance Test Reporting
The issue concerning reporting unused acceptance tests was closed ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16273)). The decision was made that this is no longer needed as the team has switched to primarily using gateless mode for tests.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Documentation
Discussion on the documentation for the DA Footprint Limit ([#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1742)) continues, with the latest comment suggesting that this issue could be tracked alongside the documentation for the `MinBaseFee` feature. The discussion emphasizes the importance of documenting the risks associated with setting the `daFootprintGasScalar` too high or too low.
