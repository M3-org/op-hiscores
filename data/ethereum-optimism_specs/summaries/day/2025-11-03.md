# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Nov 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in documentation, with new specifications for GovernanceToken, MIPS64, and FaultDisputeGame, alongside quality improvements for existing experimental contract specifications.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Contract Specifications
New comprehensive specifications were added for key components, including the `GovernanceToken` ([#848](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/848)), `MIPS64` virtual machine ([#847](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/847)), and the `FaultDisputeGame` family, covering all its variants ([#846](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/846), [#852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/852)).

### Specification Quality and Structure Improvements
Efforts were made to improve the quality of experimental contract specifications by addressing various issues across 31 documents ([#854](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/854)). Additionally, the `OptimismPortal` function specifications were cleaned up to accurately reflect the current contract ([#853](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/853)), and specifications were reorganized by moving them to a dedicated `/specs` folder ([#851](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/851)).

### Protocol Configurability Updates
The configurability documentation was updated to include new parameters, deferring to the Superchain registry TOML files for a single source of truth and enabling future governance updates ([#850](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/850)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Configurability Documentation Resolution
Issue [#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/770), concerning the interaction of `daFootprintGasScalar` and `minBaseFee` with the standard configuration, was closed. The resolution involves deferring to the Superchain registry TOML files, which can be updated via governance votes, thus avoiding duplicate sources of truth.

### Acceptance Test Reporting
Issue [#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16273), which aimed to discover and report unused acceptance tests, was closed. The rationale for closing was that the team has switched to primarily using gateless mode, rendering the original requirement less relevant.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Documentation
Issue [#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1742) discusses the documentation for the DA Footprint Limit. The latest comment suggests tracking this issue alongside `[DOCS] Begin documenting MinBaseFee feature docs#1710`, noting that the topic is relatively self-explanatory. The issue emphasizes the importance of documenting the risks associated with setting the `daFootprintGasScalar` too high (excluding too much traffic) or too low (ineffective against spam/DA backlogs).
