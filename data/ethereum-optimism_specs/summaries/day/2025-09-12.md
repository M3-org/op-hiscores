## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Devnet and Testing Infrastructure Improvements
Several issues related to development and testing infrastructure were closed. This includes the closure of a script for permissionless devnet spinup, which was deemed implemented elsewhere/differently ([#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/346)). Additionally, issues concerning test retries ([#188](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/188)) and returning test stdout & stderr ([#198](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/198)) were closed, with the latter being marked as completed.

### Isthmus Withdrawals Root Action Tests
The issue regarding porting Isthmus withdrawals root Action Tests was closed ([#168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/168)), as Isthmus has already shipped.

### op-geth CPU Usage Anomaly
The issue concerning abnormal CPU usage with op-geth v1.101511.0 was closed ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/613)). The latest comment suggests the issue might have resolved after log indexing introduced by Geth 1.15.x finished.

## NEW ISSUES
### Receipt Correction in op-geth
A new critical issue was reported concerning receipt correction, specifically "Failed to decode RLP receipts" with op-geth v1.101602.0 ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/679)). This issue causes crashes during full sync on op-mainnet.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Abnormal CPU usage with latest op-geth ( v1.101511.0 ) ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/613))
This issue, which was closed today, discussed abnormal CPU usage with op-geth v1.101511.0. The latest comment from `cpuchainorg` on September 12, 2025, at 12:15:48Z, suggests that the CPU usage decreased after log indexing, introduced by Geth 1.15.x, was completed. Earlier discussions involved `PierrickGT` and `jsvisa` sharing methods to capture pprof metrics to diagnose the high CPU usage, with `PierrickGT` confirming the issue was due to index updates taking about 24 hours. `hekich` also noted that after an index upgrade, the CPU usage returned to normal.

### Receipt Correction: Failed to decode RLP receipts ( v1.101602.0 ) ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/679))
This newly opened issue reports crashes due to "Failed to decode RLP receipts" with op-geth v1.101602.0 during full sync on op-mainnet. The initial report by `cpuchainorg` on September 12, 2025, at 12:19:12Z, indicates that Geth crashes with logs filled with "Receipt Correction." The full log is unavailable due to the crash.
