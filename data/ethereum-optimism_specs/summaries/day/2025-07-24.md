### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerting Improvements
Discussions on [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16388) continued, focusing on establishing comprehensive monitoring and alerting for flashblocks integration, particularly for op-sepolia. Key points from the latest comments include defining specific metrics and thresholds for alerts, such as minimum peer count (4), SLAs for block progression and divergence, and handling pending transactions (alert if exceeding ~60). There was also a focus on flashblocks-specific metrics like `reth_op_rbuilder_total_block_built_duration` (p99 over time interval) and monitoring `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` connections for failures and errors. Additionally, metrics for `flashblocks-rpc` node-reth related to upstream errors and message rates were discussed, along with inheriting most op-node alerts and metrics for `op-node-rbuilder`. An associated PR, https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/k8s/pull/7162, was linked.
