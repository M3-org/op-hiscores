## NEW ISSUES
### Specs Upgrade Script Improvement
A new issue was opened to improve the specs upgrade transaction generator script [#779](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/779). The goal is to integrate helper functions from a previous pull request to simplify hardfork specifications by only requiring the recording of invocation environment variables.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Fusaka Hardfork Preparation
Discussion continued on preparing `op-node` for the Fusaka hardfork [#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17493). A recent comment highlighted a potential concern: tightly coupling to upstream Geth code might necessitate an absolute prestate update with every upstream merge and subsequent `op-geth` / `op-node` release.

### op-acceptor Configuration Logging and Parallelism
Discussions on `op-acceptor` issues concluded with updates on configuration logging [#461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/461) and package parallelism [#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/462). Both issues were marked as done, with the changes implemented in a related pull request in the `infra` repository.
