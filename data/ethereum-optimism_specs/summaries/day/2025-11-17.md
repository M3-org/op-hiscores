## CLOSED ISSUES

### RPC Specification Enhancements

This indicates a push towards standardizing and clarifying RPC interactions within the Optimism ecosystem.

### Bug and Flakiness Resolution
Multiple bug reports and flaky test issues were closed, often due to age or lack of recent recurrence. This includes issues related to `op-node` goroutine stalls, `op-geth` state DB corruption, and specific flaky tests like `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` and `TestMissingBatchE2E`.

### Test Infrastructure Improvements
An issue to parallelize the "memory-all" job in `op-acceptance-tests` was closed, indicating that this optimization is no longer needed.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node` Goroutine Stalls
Issue [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16332) regarding `op-node` v1.13.3 experiencing thousands of stuck goroutines was closed by mslipper due to age, with a request to reopen if the issue persists in later releases. Previous comments from rrrengineer and Creamers158 confirmed similar observations on v1.13.3.

### `min-base-fee` Feature Relevance
mslipper inquired about the relevance of issues [#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16958) (simulations for `min-base-fee` effectiveness) and [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16959) (runbook for low batcher throughput with `min-base-fee`) to geoknee, suggesting a review of their current priority.

### `op-reth` Integration in Acceptance Tests
mslipper questioned the relevance of issue [#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17475) (adding `op-reth` back to jovian kt-devnet) to geoknee and theochap. geoknee previously commented that with the deprecation of kurtosis devnet, `op-reth` should instead be integrated into the devstack/sysgo system.

### Flaky Test: `TestMissingBatchE2E`
Issue [#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18138) was closed, with pcw109550 providing logs of a failure where the verifier found a transaction that should not have been included, indicating a discrepancy in expected behavior.

### `op-geth` State DB Corruption
Issue [#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/549) concerning `op-geth` full node state DB corruption was closed by mslipper due to age, with a note to reopen if the issue returns. Earlier comments from protolambda and sebastianst discussed potential causes related to journaled layers and the `buffer_layers` attribute during state persistence.
