## CLOSED ISSUES

### RPC Specification Updates
Several issues related to RPC specifications were closed. This includes the specification for the `optimism_dependencySet` RPC endpoint ([#713](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/713)) and the specification for `op-node` managed-mode RPC, including authentication and method definitions ([#582](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/582)).

### Interop Specification Cleanup
Multiple issues concerning outdated interop specifications were closed, indicating a cleanup and update of these documents. This includes a general tracker for updating out-of-date interop specs ([#628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/628)) and the removal of unreleased predeploys from the Interop Predeploys Spec ([#633](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/633)).

### Flaky Test Resolutions
Several flaky tests were addressed and closed. This includes `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17966)) and `TestMissingBatchE2E` ([#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18138)). The `TestMissingBatchE2E` issue was closed after an example failure was provided, indicating a resolution or understanding of the flakiness.

### Older Issue Closures
A number of older issues were closed due to age or being deemed no longer relevant. This includes an issue regarding `op-geth` full node state DB corruption ([#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/549)), ensuring Engine API status/error return values match spec ([#596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/596)), L2 networks diverging over multiple reorg test runs ([#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15782)), and `op-node` v1.13.3 experiencing thousands of stuck goroutines ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16332)).

## NEW ISSUES

No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-devstack`: `sysext`: fix address book ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15817))
The issue, initially closed by @mslipper due to KT being deprecated, was reopened by @ajsutton. The reason for reopening is that there are still several TODOs associated with this issue, indicating that the problem of the `sysext` address book not being aware of updated `kt` local devnet descriptions persists and requires further attention.

### Flaky test: TestBreakTimestampInvariant ([#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18137))
This issue remains active, with @mslipper providing an example failure link from CircleCI, confirming the flakiness of the `TestBreakTimestampInvariant` test. The issue is still under investigation to determine the root cause and implement a fix.
