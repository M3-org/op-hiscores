## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Deprecation of Req-Resp P2P Sync
Discussion on [#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/14108) continues regarding the deprecation of the `req-resp` P2P sync in `op-node`. The latest comments highlight the limitations of the current `req-resp` protocol, including its slowness, susceptibility to race conditions, and networking complexities (e.g., UDP issues, lack of domain name support). An alternative approach was proposed, suggesting a complementary system where multiple "drivers" can gossip blocks, including a centralized driver using Redis for latest unsafe block propagation and an EL query for block fetching on restarts. This alternative aims for cheaper operation, simpler networking, and faster scale-out and recovery.
