# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant documentation enhancements, particularly in specifying cross-domain messenger contracts and updating the Jovian protocol with new DA footprint receipt fields.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Cross-Domain Messenger Specifications
Comprehensive specifications for both L1 and L2 CrossDomainMessenger contracts were added, detailing their functionalities and interactions within the Optimism ecosystem. These new documents are crucial for understanding the core messaging mechanisms between layers.
- L2 CrossDomainMessenger specification ([#837](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/837))
- L1 CrossDomainMessenger specification ([#840](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/840))

### Jovian Protocol Updates
The Jovian protocol specification was updated to include new Data Availability (DA) footprint receipt fields, specifically `daFootprintGasScalar` and the setting of `blobGasUsed` to the transaction's DA footprint. This update aligns the specification with recent changes in the `op-geth` implementation.
- DA footprint receipt fields added to Jovian specification ([#839](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/839))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request was opened to create the GasPriceOracle specification ([#841](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/841)).
- Another pull request was opened to fix a wrong word in a comment ([#838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/838)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation Link Fixes
Several issues related to broken internal links and outdated documentation were addressed and closed, improving the overall navigability and accuracy of the Optimism documentation.
- Issue on docs: some internal links in tutorials are broken ([#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1802))
- Issue on docs ([#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1797))

### Flashblocks Timeout Resolution
An issue concerning a 30-second timeout on the Flashblocks websocket URL, caused by Cloudflare-GCP interference, was investigated and resolved.
- Figure out 30 second timeout issue on the Flashblocks websocket URL ([#17858](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17858))

### Audit-Related Documentation
An issue related to the 2024 Q4 Audit concerning a specific page path was closed.
- [2024 Q4 Audit] [page-path] ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1789))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Celestia Batcher DA Size Fix
Discussions continued on investigating and potentially upstreaming a fix for the `op-batcher`'s max frame size limitation in generic commitment mode for alternative DA solutions ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17796), [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17872)). A Celestia-developed fix was reviewed and deemed good, with a request for them to open a PR. A PR for this fix has since been opened.
