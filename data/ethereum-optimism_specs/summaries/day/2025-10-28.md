## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Celestia Batcher DA Size Fix
Discussion continues on [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17796) regarding the `op-batcher`'s max frame size limitation in generic commitment mode for alternative DA. A potential fix from Celestia was reviewed and deemed good, with a request for them to open a PR. This is also related to [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17872), where the investigation into upstreaming the Celestia batcher DA size fix is ongoing, with the fix reviewed and a PR requested.
