# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Nov 25, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant feature addition: the specification for Custom Gas Token (CGT) support, impacting multiple core protocol components. Discussions also continued on a critical sequencer recovery mode bug.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Custom Gas Token Specification
A major new feature was introduced with the specification for Custom Gas Token (CGT) support. This includes detailed technical implementation requirements across various protocol components such as bridges, messengers, the Optimism Portal, predeploys, and system configuration. This enhancement aims to provide greater flexibility in gas payment mechanisms within the Optimism ecosystem. ([#749](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/749))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#864](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/864), was opened to address a broken Mermaid diagram in the flashblock documentation.

### Sequencer Recovery Mode Bug Investigation
Discussions continued on a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer recovery mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18350)). The latest comments indicate that when the sequencer is in recovery mode during normal operation, it may request an L1 origin block that doesn't yet exist, leading to "not found" errors and potentially stalling L1 origin advancement. This can violate the sequencer drift rule and cause derivation to stall if a bad batch is committed to L1. A possible fix snippet was proposed to prevent temporary errors when recovery mode catches up to the tip. Further investigation is ongoing to understand why temporary errors persist and if asynchronous L1 origin fetching might be a contributing factor.
