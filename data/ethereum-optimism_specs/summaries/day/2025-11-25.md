# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Nov 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a significant feature addition: the specification for Custom Gas Token (CGT) support, impacting various protocol components. Discussions continued on an active issue regarding sequencer recovery mode behavior.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Custom Gas Token Specification
A new feature was added to define the technical requirements for Custom Gas Token (CGT) support. This involved extensive updates across multiple protocol specifications, including bridges, messengers, the Optimism Portal, overview, predeploys, system configuration, and withdrawals. This enhancement is crucial for expanding the flexibility and functionality of the Optimism ecosystem. ([#749](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/749))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#864](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/864), was opened to address a broken mermaid diagram in flashblock.

### Sequencer Recovery Mode Behavior
Discussions continued on a potential bug in the `op-node` sequencer recovery mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18350)). The core problem appears to be that when the sequencer is in recovery mode during normal operation, it may request an L1 origin block that doesn't yet exist, leading to "not found" errors. This prevents the L1 origin from advancing and can violate the sequencer drift rule, potentially causing derivation stalls if a bad batch is submitted to L1. A possible fix snippet was proposed to prevent temporary errors when recovery mode reaches the tip of the chain. Further investigation is ongoing to understand why temporary errors persist and if asynchronous L1 origin fetching might be influencing the behavior.
