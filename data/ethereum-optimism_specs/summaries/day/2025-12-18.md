# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical maintenance, including fixing a CI linting issue and updating Cannon specifications with new syscalls. Discussions continued on interop transaction simplification and `op-challenger` trace output.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD Enhancements
A critical CI issue was resolved, fixing a broken `lint-specs-md-check` that was failing in CI despite working locally. This ensures consistent linting across development environments and the CI pipeline. ([#870](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/870))

### Cannon Specification Updates
The Cannon specifications were updated to include recently added syscalls `getrandom` and `eventfd2`, along with the `eventfd` file descriptor and `mprotect`. This keeps the Cannon VM specification current with new system call functionalities. ([#869](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/869))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interop Action Test Re-enablement
The issue concerning disabled Kona interop action tests was closed, with confirmation that the tests are now re-enabled. However, it was noted that Kona CI does not yet block on these tests, a change planned for when Kona migrates to the Optimism monorepo. ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18613))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Transactions
Discussions continued regarding the necessity and implications of the additional transaction for replacement blocks in the interop specification. The latest comments indicate a growing consensus to simplify the protocol by removing the extra deposit transaction for proofs, as it may be unnecessary in a ZK dispute system where derivation is re-run. Concerns were raised about the downsides of relying solely on the supernode to record data, such as lack of consensus checks and potential data unavailability, but these are considered less critical with ZK proofs. The next steps involve assigning someone to refactor the mechanism and updating the Interop specification. ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18574))

### op-challenger: Review Correct Trace Output When Next Super Root Is Not Found
This issue highlights a potential problem with the `op-challenger`'s trace output when the next super root is not found. The current test asserts that all steps should be `InvalidTransitionHash`, but this might be incorrect. The `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash on the first chain with insufficient data. There's also a discussion about the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test's correctness and how the `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC behaves when chains are not supported by L1. ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18643))
