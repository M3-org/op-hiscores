# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical maintenance, including fixing a CI linting issue and updating Cannon specifications with new syscalls. Discussions continued on interop transaction simplification and `op-challenger` trace output.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD Enhancements
A critical CI issue was resolved, fixing a broken `lint-specs-md-check` that was failing in CI despite working locally. This was due to `npx` downloading a newer `markdownlint-cli2` version in CI than specified in `package.json` locally. ([#870](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/870))

### Cannon VM Specification Updates
The Cannon specifications were updated to include recently added syscalls `getrandom` and `eventfd2`, and to add `mprotect` to the VM. This ensures the Cannon fault proof VM accurately reflects the latest system call functionalities. ([#869](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/869))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Interop Action Test Re-enablement
The issue concerning disabled Kona interop action tests was closed. The tests are now re-enabled, though CI currently does not block on their execution. This will be addressed once Kona is migrated to the Optimism monorepo. ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18613))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Transactions
Discussions continued regarding the necessity of the additional deposit transaction for interop replacement blocks. The latest comments indicate a growing consensus to simplify the protocol by removing the extra deposit transaction, as it may not be critical for ZK proofs and could be generated by the Supernode. Concerns were raised about the downsides of not having the replacement data as part of consensus and the potential difficulty for challengers if data is unavailable, though these are considered less critical with ZK. The next steps involve assigning someone to refactor this mechanism and updating the Interop specification. ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18574))

### op-challenger: Review Correct Trace Output When Next Super Root Is Not Found
This issue highlights a potential problem with the `op-challenger`'s trace output when the next super root is not found. The current test asserts that all steps should be `InvalidTransitionHash`, but this might not be correct. The `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash on the first chain with insufficient data. There's also a question about the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test's correctness and how the `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC behaves when chains are not supported by L1.
