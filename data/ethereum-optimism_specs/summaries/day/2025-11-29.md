## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Documentation Clarity for Simulation Links**
  Discussion continued on [#789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/789), which addresses the need to update `NESTED.md` and `SINGLE.md` to reflect the two-step simulation link format used by Base. A new comment from Himess acknowledged the issue's age but emphasized the ongoing need for clearer documentation. Himess also mentioned submitting a PR to provide more detailed guidance, offering to close the issue if the proposed changes are sufficient.

- **Porting SuperchainConfig Type**
  The issue [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/741), concerning the porting of the `SuperchainConfig` type from `superchain-registry`, saw a new comment from Himess. Himess documented the `SuperchainDefinition` type in the specs based on the referenced `superchain-registry` code and provided a commit link for review. Himess also inquired if this meets the original request and noted that the referenced PR (op-rs/kona#2562) did not seem directly related to this specific change.
