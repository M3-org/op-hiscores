## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Documentation Clarity for Simulation Links**
  Discussion continued on [#789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/789), which addresses the need to update `NESTED.md` and `SINGLE.md` to reflect changes in how Base prints simulation links. A new comment from Himess acknowledged the issue's age but emphasized the ongoing need for clearer documentation. Himess mentioned submitting a PR with more detailed guidance and is open to closing the issue if the existing updates are deemed sufficient.

- **Porting SuperchainConfig Type**
  On [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/741), Himess provided an update regarding the request to port the `SuperchainConfig` type from `superchain-registry`. Himess documented the `SuperchainDefinition` type in the specs based on the referenced `superchain-registry` code and shared a commit for review. Himess also noted that the referenced PR (op-rs/kona#2562) did not seem directly related to this specific change and is awaiting confirmation on whether the documentation meets the original request before opening a formal PR.
