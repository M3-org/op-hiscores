# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 30, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing documentation for experimental contracts, with a new specification for the GasPriceOracle. Discussions on active issues included transaction gas limits and L1 chain configuration for L3s.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Experimental Contract Documentation
A new comprehensive specification for the `GasPriceOracle` L2 predeploy contract was added, detailing its functionality and address ([#841](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/841)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request was opened to create the `GovernanceToken` specification ([#848](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/848)).
- Documentation for the `MIPS64` specification was proposed ([#847](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/847)).
- A pull request was opened to create the `FaultDisputeGame` specification ([#846](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/846)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Transaction Gas Limit Issues
Discussion on [#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17912) regarding "transaction gas limit too high" for `op-deployer:v0.2.6` confirmed that the Fusaka hardfork (EIP-7825) enforces a transaction gas limit of 16,777,216. This limit prevents large transactions, suggesting they need to be broken down or optimized. It was also noted that `op-deployer:v0.5.0` is the latest version, though its post-Fusaka compatibility is yet to be fully tested.

### L1 Chain Configuration for L3s
On [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18070), the conversation centered on the ability for `op-node` and `op-program` to skip L1 chain configuration for L3s. A key suggestion was to automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID to simplify the process for most L3s, similar to how Mainnet and Sepolia are recognized.

### Acceptance Test Challenges
Issue [#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/469) highlighted difficulties in running acceptance tests without the monorepo. A recent comment pointed out that modifying devnets with options often fails due to private orchestrator fields.
