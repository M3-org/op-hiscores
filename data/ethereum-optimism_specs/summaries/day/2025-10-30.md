# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 30, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing documentation for experimental contracts, with a new specification for the GasPriceOracle. Discussions on active issues included transaction gas limits and L1 chain configuration for L3s.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Experimental Contract Documentation
A new comprehensive specification for the `GasPriceOracle` L2 predeploy contract was added, detailing its functionality and address ([#841](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/841)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request was opened to create a specification for the `GovernanceToken` ([#848](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/848)).
- Documentation for the `MIPS64` specification was proposed in a new pull request ([#847](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/847)).
- A pull request was opened to create the `FaultDisputeGame` specification ([#846](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/846)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Transaction Gas Limit Issues
Discussion on [#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17912) clarified that the "transaction gas limit too high" error is due to the Fusaka hardfork enforcing a transaction gas limit cap of 16,777,216 (EIP-7825). This means transactions exceeding this limit must be broken down or optimized. It was also noted that an older version of `op-deployer` was being used, and the latest v0.5.0* (release candidate) should be tested, though it might still encounter the same problem post-Fusaka.

### L1 Chain Config for L3s
On [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18070), the discussion revolved around the ability for `op-node` and `op-program` to skip L1 chain configuration for L3s. A key suggestion was to automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID and apply L3 behavior, similar to how L1 mainnet and Sepolia are recognized, to simplify the process for most L3s.

### Acceptance Test Challenges
Issue [#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/469) highlighted difficulties in running acceptance tests without the monorepo, specifically regarding contract artifacts and modifying devnets. The latest comment noted that modifying devnets with options often fails because orchestrator fields are private.
