# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Sep 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining and improving the tooling for generating upgrade transaction specifications, alongside a bug fix related to flashblocks authorship. A new pull request for revenue sharing specs was opened, and discussions continued on standardizing network upgrade transactions and addressing redundant address structs.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Upgrade Transaction Specification Generation
*   New scripts were added to streamline the generation of specifications for upgrade and proxy update transactions, improving efficiency for future network upgrades ([#673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/673)).
*   Improvements were made to the specs tool, including factoring out per-fork constants for brevity and deduplication, removing unwanted whitespace from templates, and co-locating scripts for better organization ([#780](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/780)).

### Protocol Specification Refinements
*   A bug related to flashblocks authorship within the protocol specifications was fixed, ensuring accuracy in the documentation ([#775](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/775)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/782), was opened to add specifications for revenue sharing.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Tooling Improvement for Upgrade Transaction Generation
The issue [#779](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/779), which aimed to improve the specs upgrade transaction generator script, was closed today. This suggests that the improvements discussed, likely related to helper functions and consistent invocation environments, have been implemented.

### Standardization of Address Structs
The issue [#14977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/14977), concerning the creation of a single source of truth for address structs to eliminate duplication across packages, was closed. The intended scope of this work has been completed.

## NEW ISSUES

### Standardizing Network Upgrade Transactions
A new issue, [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/781), was opened to enshrine a new convention for Network Upgrade Transactions that deploy new contracts. The current practice of using a unique `from` address with `nonce=0` for such transactions is being re-evaluated due to its impact on deployed addresses.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Standardizing Network Upgrade Transactions ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/781))
Discussion on this newly opened issue focuses on the address computation for new contract deployments during network upgrades. Protolambda provided a detailed analysis of `CREATE`, `CREATE2`, and upgrade source-hash address computations, confirming no immediate collision risks due to differing keccak preimages. A suggestion was made to potentially use `CREATE2` with a system address as the deployer and the source-hash as a salt to further integrate with existing address computation frameworks and prevent future collisions.
