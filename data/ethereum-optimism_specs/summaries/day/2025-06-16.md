No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Data Availability Error Specification
A new issue was opened to address missing Super DA error codes in the specification. This aims to align the spec with the Go implementation regarding data availability errors caused by reorgs, ensuring consistent error handling across the system. ([#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/725))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### CI SLAs Discussion
Discussions continued on defining Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16437)). Key points from the latest comments include:
- **Developer Perspective on SLAs**: Developers expressed skepticism about the direct impact of these SLAs on their daily work, noting that issues would be reported regardless of SLA adherence.
- **Flaky Tests**: A significant concern raised was the prevalence of flaky tests. Suggestions included developing a strong process for fixing flaky tests or implementing smarter methods to prevent new flaky tests from being admitted into the repository, such as running multiple instances of new test cases in parallel to proactively detect flakiness.
- **Proposed Metrics Review**: Feedback was provided on the proposed metrics:
    - The 5% expected failure rate was considered high.
    - An hour for CI completion for 80% of PRs was deemed too long, with a preference for pre-merge checks under 10 minutes.
    - Disabling breaking checks was strongly advised against, with a preference for reverting the PR that introduced the breakage.
    - PR merge time was questioned as a meaningful CI metric, as it depends more on reviews and rework than CI performance.
- **Next Steps**: The team plans to consider the feedback, produce a lightweight proposal with ideas, and seek further feedback, likely after the "Pause."

### Configurable Dependency Set
Discussions continued regarding making the dependency set configurable within supersim ([#361](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/361)). The latest comments focused on:
- **Implementation Suggestion**: A suggestion was made to implement a `--dependency-set <chains>` flag, allowing users to specify which chains should be part of a dependency set.
- **Reference Material**: Links to the dependency set specification and relevant code in the monorepo were provided as starting points for implementation.
- **Use Case**: The utility of this feature was highlighted for testing applications both within and outside of a dependency set.
