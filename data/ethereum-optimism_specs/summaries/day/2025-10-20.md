# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on clarifying the lack of transactions in genesis blocks for Jovian and Isthmus protocols, alongside discussions on active issues related to DA footprint limits, Jovian marshalling, and improving `op-up` for local development.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Protocol Specification Clarifications
*   A pull request was merged to clarify the absence of transactions in the genesis block for both the Jovian and Isthmus protocols, enhancing the accuracy of the `specs/protocol` documentation ([#801](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/801)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   A new pull request, [#802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/802), was opened to improve the GovernanceToken specification.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Implementation
Discussion on the "DA Footprint Limit" implementation ([#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17551)) indicates that progress is currently blocked by a related spec derivation issue in the `optimism` repository.

### Jovian Marshalling of SystemConfig Fields
The issue regarding Jovian not marshalling new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17907)) is being discussed. The primary concern is that new fields break zk stacks that use the rollup configuration for commitment hashing. A potential solution of adding a nullable system config is being considered, with a check to see if updating `op-succinct/kailua` directly is a viable alternative.

### Improving `op-up` for Local Development
The discussion around improving `op-up` to serve as a system runner during development ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17942)) highlights the need for a new tool to replace Kurtosis for spinning up local devnets. There's also a consideration of whether a CLI tool is strictly necessary, given the simplicity of creating long-running acceptance tests.
