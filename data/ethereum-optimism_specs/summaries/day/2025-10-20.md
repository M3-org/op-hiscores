# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on clarifying the lack of transactions in genesis blocks for Jovian and Isthmus protocols, alongside discussions on active issues related to DA footprint limits, Jovian marshalling, and improving `op-up` for local development.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Protocol Specification Clarifications
*   A pull request was merged to clarify the absence of transactions in the genesis block for both the Jovian and Isthmus protocols, enhancing the accuracy of the `l1-attributes.md` specifications ([#801](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/801)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   A new pull request, [#802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/802), was opened to improve the GovernanceToken specification within the documentation.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Implementation
Discussion on the "[DA Footprint Limit] Complete implementation" issue ([#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17551)) indicates that progress is currently blocked by a related spec derivation issue in the main Optimism repository.

### Jovian Rollup Configuration Marshalling
The issue "jovian: do not marshal new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active" ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17907)) is being discussed due to its impact on zk stacks that use the rollup configuration for commitment hashing. There's an ongoing conversation about whether to update `op-succinct/kailua` directly or implement a nullable system config, with a team member checking on the feasibility of the latter.

### Improving `op-up` for Local Development
The issue "Improve `op-up` so it can serve as a sysgo runner during development" ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17942)) highlights the need for `op-up` to replace Kurtosis as a tool for spinning up local devnets. Initial comments suggest considering whether a CLI tool is strictly necessary, given the simplicity of creating long-running acceptance tests.
