# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Jun 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in refining supervisor specifications and enhancing Superchain-Ops tooling, with multiple issues related to task management, testing, and developer experience being closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Supervisor Specification Refinements
- Added constraints for `supervisor_syncStatus` to improve interop specifications ([#723](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/723)).
- Clarified the concept of a "managed node" within the supervisor documentation, distinguishing it from `indexing` and `following` modes ([#732](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/732)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain-Ops Tooling and Task Management Improvements
- Implemented automated task execution in CI for non-terminal tasks, improving efficiency and reducing manual intervention ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/337)).
- Enhanced support for "stacked" proposals with incrementing nonces, streamlining the execution of multiple sequential tasks ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/342)).
- Refined `SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER` behavior to check for a value of `1`, preventing "bugs" when tasks are made interactive ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/448)).
- Updated `fetch-task.sh` to use the mainnet task directory, aligning with actual deployment environments ([#547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/547)).
- Updated paths in improvement documentation to reflect current file structures ([#548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/548)).
- Closed the issue for testing Sepolia task to transfer owner of ProtocolVersions, as templates for L1 and L2 owner transfers are now implemented ([#554](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/554)).
- Completed training calls and created Loom videos for the new Superchain-Ops tooling, improving user adoption ([#514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/514)).
- Updated task paths for mainnet tasks, ensuring monorepo integration tests point to the correct directories ([#600](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/600)).
- Closed the issue regarding MultisigTask Architecture, as a larger refactor project is underway to support arbitrary nesting ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/636)).
- Updated tests to use `contracts-bedrock` safe-tools and `stdStorage` library, enhancing maintainability and readability ([#605](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/605)).
- Addressed the issue of prevalidations being hindered by address registry availability, allowing necessary prevalidations in task `_templateSetup` functions ([#654](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/654)).
- Improved the speed of the `template_regression_tests` CI job ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/648)).
- Created mainnet examples for OPCM templates, providing clear simulation examples ([#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/651)).
- Implemented checks for domain hash matching `VALIDATIONS.md` entries as part of stacked simulations ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/679)).
- Implemented markdown formatting for state diff printing, improving readability ([#777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/777)).
- Implemented more granular checking of `addresses.json` to reduce the need for frequent `scr` submodule updates ([#753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/753)).
- Closed the issue for simple UX for users to override Nonces, as `config.toml` files provide clear and functional UX ([#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/770)).
- Fixed `StateOverrideManager` to prevent it from always adding the nonce as a state override ([#814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/814)).
- Implemented checks against `StandardValidator` contracts within OPCM templates' `_validate` functions ([#838](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/838)).
- Added a quick way to read addresses for chains not in the Superchain Registry, improving developer workflow ([#923](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/923)).

### Supervisor Sync Status Constraints
- Closed the issue regarding adding constraints for `supervisor_syncStatus`, which was addressed by PR [#723](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/723) ([#718](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/718)).

### OPCM Migrate Script Improvements
- Closed the issue for OPCM Migrate Script Improvements, with updates to the runbook to include sanity checks for script inputs ([#16326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16326)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Abnormal CPU usage with latest op-geth ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/613))
Discussion continues on the abnormal CPU usage observed with `op-geth` v1.101511.0. Users are sharing command-line arguments for `pprof` to capture CPU performance data. It's suggested that the high CPU usage might be temporary due to log indexing rebuilds, but some users report persistence even after index upgrades. A user shared a `profile.pb.gz` file for analysis, noting that their performance issue was due to index updates taking about 24 hours.

### Use GoReleaser for op-node/batcher/proposer/challenger release pipeline ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16097))
The discussion revolves around automating the release pipeline and generating release notes for OP Stack components. There's a desire for a one-click solution for high-quality, accurate changelogs. Concerns were raised about adding another build system (GoReleaser) without first consolidating existing ones (docker bake, makefiles, justfiles) to avoid further bloat and inconsistencies. A lighter-weight solution for changelog generation using `git cliff` was also documented.

### [op-acceptance-tests] Move all AT's into the one workflow ([#16272](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16272))
A recent comment points to related pull requests in `infra` and `optimism` repositories, indicating ongoing work to consolidate acceptance tests into a single workflow.

### Refactor signFromChildMultisig to reduce noisy terminal output ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/781))
Community members are actively engaging with this issue, expressing interest in working on it. The core problem identified is the `print` function within `MultisigTask.sol` generating excessive terminal output during simulations. Proposed solutions include removing or commenting out the `print` call in `simulateRun` to focus on critical signing information.

### what's the difference between supersim and interop kurtosis devnet? ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/399))
The discussion clarifies that `supersim` is a lighter-weight local development tool, a wrapper around `anvil`, primarily for testing multichain/interop applications and dapps. In contrast, Kurtosis is used by the OP Stack for testing chains. `supersim` is noted for its ability to test upcoming features like interop, with several applications already using it for development.
