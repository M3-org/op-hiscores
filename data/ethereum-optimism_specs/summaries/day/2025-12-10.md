# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Dec 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining system configuration specifications, specifically addressing how malformed updates are handled within the protocol.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### System Configuration Specification Refinement
A change was made to the system configuration specifications to explicitly define malformed updates as "skipped." This clarifies protocol behavior when encountering invalid system configuration updates. ([#868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/868))

### Sequencer Recovery Mode Behavior
Discussion continued on an issue concerning a possible bug in the `op-node` sequencer's recovery mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18350)). The latest comment points to a potentially relevant PR ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)) that might influence the observed behavior where the sequencer in recovery mode requests an L1 origin block that does not yet exist, leading to "not found" errors and potential stalling of L1 origin advancement. Previous discussions explored a potential fix snippet to prevent temporary errors in recovery mode and the impact of async L1 origin fetching.
