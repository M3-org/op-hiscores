# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Jun 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on ongoing discussions and investigations into `op-supervisor` behavior, particularly concerning reset logic and L1 origin validity, alongside addressing a dependency issue in `op-chain-ops` and continued debugging of `op-geth` CPU usage.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Dependency Issues
- An issue was opened regarding a broken dependency in `op-chain-ops` related to `github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39` [#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16612). The `cosmos/go-bip39` fork is noted as a potential alternative, but its version (`v1.0.0`) differs from the one used by Optimism (`v1.1.0`).

### Supervisor Performance Investigation
- An issue was created to investigate spikes of `local-derived` and `local-unsafe-received` events in `op-supervisor` [#16603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16603). Initial speculation points towards a potential `ChainsDB` or `GlobalSyncExec` deadlock.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Supervisor Reset Logic and L1 Origin Validity
Discussions continued on improving `op-supervisor`'s reset target handling and L1 origin validity checks.
- For [#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16314), it was noted that partial implementation has occurred via a related PR, specifically regarding the supervisor providing reset targets. However, it still lacks handling for pre- and post-Interop differences and the supervisor's log DB.
- In [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16315), it was highlighted that a L1 origin verifier method now exists on the supervisor side, used for detecting the validity of L1 origin for local unsafe. The discussion suggests extending this method to safe heads to ensure all targets provided by the supervisor are valid.
- Regarding [#16321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16321), the current status after a related PR is that the supervisor detects the correct local unsafe head by checking the L1 origin before sending an `interop_reset` request. However, L1 origin validity for other safety levels is not yet checked, which is tracked in [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16315).

### Abnormal CPU Usage in op-geth
Ongoing investigation into abnormal CPU usage with `op-geth` v1.101511.0.
- In [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/613), a user shared pprof command-line arguments for capturing CPU performance data. Another user confirmed experiencing the same issue and provided a `profile.pb.gz` file, noting that the performance issue might be due to an index update taking about 24 hours. It was also suggested that the high CPU usage might be temporary due to log indexing rebuilding, and should return to normal once completed.
