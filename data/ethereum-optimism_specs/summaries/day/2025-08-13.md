## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-challenger` Acceptance Test Refinement
Issue [#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15948), "op-challenger acceptance tests on interop," was re-opened by mbaxter on Aug 13, 2025, at 18:30:56Z. The re-opening indicates that there are still outstanding TODOs related to this issue that need to be addressed, despite previous work. The issue aims to add acceptance tests for `op-challenger` functionality on interop chains, specifically covering dispute resolution of invalid proposals.

### `op-sync-tester` RPC Support
Issue [#16700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16700), "op-sync-tester: Support eth namespace," was re-opened by pcw109550 on Aug 13, 2025, at 09:03:49Z. The re-opening is to track the implementation of test cases for the `eth` namespace within `op-sync-tester`. This issue focuses on enabling `op-sync-tester` to serve specific `eth` RPC methods like `eth_getBlockReceipts`, `eth_getBlockByHash`, and `eth_getBlockByNumber` for blocks prior to a `test_head`.
