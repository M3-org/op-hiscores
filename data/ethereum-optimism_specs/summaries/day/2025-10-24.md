# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused heavily on documentation, with numerous new specifications created for experimental and legacy contracts within the OP Stack, enhancing clarity and understanding of core components.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Comprehensive Contract Specification Documentation
Significant progress was made in documenting various experimental and legacy contracts. New specifications were created for `LivenessGuard` ([#820](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/820)), `DelayedWETH` ([#819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/819)), `DeployerWhitelist` ([#817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/817)), `L2ToL1MessagePasser` ([#827](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/827)), `L1ChugSplashProxy` ([#826](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/826)), `ProxyAdmin` ([#823](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/823)), and `Proxy` ([#821](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/821)). These additions provide detailed descriptions following the canonical OP Stack specification format.

### Improved Existing Contract Specifications
The specification for the `ETHLockbox` contract was improved and restructured to align with the canonical OP Stack specification format, enhancing its clarity and comprehensiveness ([#824](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/824)).
