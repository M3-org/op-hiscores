# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Jul 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on ongoing discussions and planning for several key areas, including interop stress testing, sync tester development, and E2E test improvements. Several issues were also closed, indicating progress on existing tasks.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES

**Resolved Nonce Errors in User Approvals**
An issue related to nonce errors when approving and executing transactions after a single approval was closed, indicating a resolution to this user experience problem. ([#1106](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1106))

**Progress on Devstack Porting**
The task of porting `TestERC20Bridge` to devstack has seen progress, with a related pull request opened in the `optimism` repository. ([#415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/415))

## NEW ISSUES

No new issues were opened.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Sync Tester Development and Session Management**
Discussions continued on the `op-sync-tester` service for mock EL sync testing ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16452)). The conversation revolved around session management, with `protolambda` suggesting using HTTP middleware to attach session information to the context based on a UUID in the URL, avoiding the need for a `sync_init` RPC. `pcw109550` proposed a session management flow involving a `sync_init` RPC to initialize an API endpoint and return a session ID, which would then be used to register a new endpoint for stateful proxying of CL requests.

**Review of `VerifyOPCM` and `DeployImplementations` Relationship**
The discussion around making `VerifyOPCM` a wrapper around `DeployImplementations` for v2 continued ([#16653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16653)). `maurelian` noted that auditors felt `VerifyOPCM` provided redundancy and was complementary to simply rerunning `DeployImplementations.s.sol`, acting as a check if either script is modified. A suggestion was made to re-run `DeployImplementations` within `VerifyOPCM` alongside other checks.

**E2E Testing for Invalid Interop Tx Reinjection**
Discussions on an E2E test for invalid interop transaction reinjection after a block reorg continued ([#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16656)). `pcw109550` suggested using `op-test-sequencer` to force include invalid execution messages and then verify that the invalid block is reorged, new L2 blocks do not contain the invalid interop transaction, and the mempool does not contain the invalid message transaction. A related PR was referenced for inspecting the mempool.

**Stress Testing Interop Expiry Window**
The issue of stress testing the interop expiry window saw renewed discussion ([#15285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/15285)). `pauldowman` clarified that the "consolidation step" refers to the final step in the fault proof program where executing messages are validated after derivation. `mds1` sought clarification on the "consolidation step." Earlier comments indicated that while the expiry window has been reduced and microbenchmarks done, an actual worst-case scenario test on interop-enabled chains is still desired.

**Duplicate Code in `op-batcher`**
A discussion regarding duplicate code in `op-batcher` was initiated ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16677)). `chuwt` questioned if `checkTxpool` is still needed given that `publishStateToL1` already performs this check. `geoknee` acknowledged the observation and welcomed a PR to address it.

**Adding a Spelling Lint**
An issue to add a spelling lint using `codespell` was active ([#680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/680)). `JoshdfG` expressed interest in taking on this task.
