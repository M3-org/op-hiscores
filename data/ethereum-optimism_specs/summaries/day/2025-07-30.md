# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Jul 30, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on clarifying safety level terminology within the interop specifications, specifically aligning `unsafe` with `local-unsafe` to improve consistency.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Interoperability Specification Refinement
A key update was made to the `specs/interop/supervisor.md` file to clarify the `SafetyLevel` terminology. This change explicitly mentions that the `unsafe` safety level matches `local-unsafe`, addressing a previous inconsistency between specifications and implementation. This enhancement improves the clarity and accuracy of the interoperability specifications. ([#722](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/722))

### RPC and Safety Level Terminology Alignment
Two issues related to RPC specifications and safety level terminology were closed today. Issue [#714](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/714) concerned the `interop_ready` RPC, while issue [#717](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/717) addressed the inconsistency between `Unsafe` in specs and `LocalUnsafe` in implementation, and `Safe` in specs versus `CrossSafe` in implementation. Both issues were resolved, contributing to improved clarity and consistency in the specifications.
