## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### L2CL<>L2EL Synchronization Conditions
Discussions continued regarding the conditions under which the L2 Execution Layer (EL) can start syncing, particularly concerning `op-geth` and `op-sepolia`. The latest comments suggest that the ticket might be closed as the issue of avoiding ReqRes sync could be handled after the initial EL Sync run, potentially within `engineController.insertUnsafePayload`. There was also agreement that the EL client should simply sync, regardless of whether it's snap-sync or full block execution via its P2P network, as long as it receives a FCU call to set new sync targets and has P2P connections.
