# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Aug 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the supervisor interop specifications with a new local safe feature. Discussions continued on critical issues including op-proposer failures, sync testing, flashblocks load testing, and sequencer alerting.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Interoperability Enhancements
A new `supervisor_localSafe` feature was added to the interop specifications, enhancing the supervisor's capabilities within the Superchain ecosystem ([#753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/753)). This contributes to improved cross-chain interoperability.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened today:
- [#751](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/751) LivenessModule: This PR likely introduces a new module related to liveness, potentially for monitoring or ensuring system responsiveness.
- [#752](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/752) TimelockGuard: This PR suggests the addition of a timelock mechanism, which could be for security or controlled access to certain functionalities.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Challenger Support in op-up
The issue regarding `op-up` support for the challenger was closed ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17005)). The decision was made that distributing the challenger within `op-up` for `sysgo` is likely not worth the effort, with a preference for focusing on other backends like Docker that do not require binary distribution.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-proposer Transaction Failures
Discussions on [#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/13502) continued, with a recent comment confirming that setting `--game-type=1` fixed the "Failed to create a transaction" error for one user. This aligns with earlier suggestions that the issue often stems from misconfigured contracts or an incorrect `game-type` for `op-proposer`.

### Sync Testing for OP Stack
Issue [#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16703) saw new ideas for sync test cases. Key suggestions include checking every OP Stack Hard Fork transition (not just Isthmus), testing with multiple Consensus Layers (CLs) and a single Sync Tester, and incorporating user transactions into L2 blocks to verify L2CL synchronization. Items 2 and 3 are being tracked in a separate issue.

### Flashblocks Load Testing
On [#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16756), there was a request for a summary document detailing the load test scenarios, networks used, and results. A team member indicated they are working on this report.

### Flashblocks Sequencer Alerting
Discussions on sequencer alerting for flashblocks continued. For [#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16867), an alert will be created once a related pull request in `rollup-boost` lands, which aims to detect when a non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off. Regarding [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16868), it was noted that peer count alerting for `op-node` sequencer peering already exists, and the focus for this issue will be on adding `reth`/`op-rbuilder` peer count alerts.
