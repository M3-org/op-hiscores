# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on updating the dispute game interface specifications to align with current implementations. Additionally, a significant issue related to light client following in `op-node` was closed, marking a key milestone in its implementation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dispute Game Interface Specification Update
The dispute game interface specifications were updated to reflect the current reality, specifically addressing the `setImplementation()` function. This ensures the documentation accurately mirrors the existing codebase. ([#871](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/871))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-node` Light Client Implementation
The issue concerning the `op-node` light client's ability to follow external sources for safe/finalized data has been closed. The `op-node` implementation is now complete, supporting the `--l2.follow.source` flag to mirror external feeds. ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18317))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-challenger`: Review correct trace output when next super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18643))
Discussion on this issue confirms that the `super node trace provider` now correctly handles cases where the next super root is not found. While `op-supervisor` will not be fixed due to its impending deletion, the issue remains open pending an integration test to verify `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments highlighted a potential problem with `op-program` transitioning to an invalid hash and questioned the correctness of the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test. The `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC's behavior of returning "not found" errors if any chain is not supported by L1 was also noted.
