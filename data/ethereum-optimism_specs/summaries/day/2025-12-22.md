# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating the dispute game interface specifications to align with current implementations. Additionally, a significant issue regarding light client following in `op-node` was closed, marking a key milestone in its development.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Fault Proof System Specification Updates
The dispute game interface specifications were updated to reflect the current implementation, specifically addressing the `setImplementation()` function. This ensures the documentation accurately represents the latest state of the fault-proof system.
- Updated dispute game interface specs ([#871](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/871))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-node` Light Client Development
The issue concerning the implementation of external following for safe/finalized data in `op-node`'s light client was closed. This indicates the successful integration of the `--l2.follow.source` flag, allowing `op-node` to mirror external safe/finalized feeds.
- `op-node`: Light CL: Follow External Source ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18317))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-challenger` Trace Output Review
Discussion continues on reviewing the correct trace output in `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18643)). The latest comment confirms that the super node trace provider now handles this correctly. While `op-supervisor` will be deleted, the issue remains open pending an integration test to verify `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments highlighted that `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash on the first chain with insufficient data, and questioned the correctness of the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test. The `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC's behavior of returning "not found" errors if any chain is unsupported by L1 was also noted.
