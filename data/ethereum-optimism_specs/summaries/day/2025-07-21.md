## CLOSED ISSUES
### Interoperability Specification Updates
Two issues related to Interoperability specifications were closed.

[#609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/609) focused on upgrading block rules specifications.

### Flashblocks Deployment Progress
Two issues concerning flashblocks deployment were closed. [#16544](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16544) aimed to enable flashblocks non-publicly on op-sepolia, which was closed in favor of a new milestone. [#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16496) was about configuring `flashblocks-rpc` (node-reth) to serve flashblocks RPC via Base's flashblocks node-reth, and was closed in favor of [#16687](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16687).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Supervisor and Node Reset Target Improvements
Discussion continued on [#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16314), which focuses on improving the `op-supervisor` and `op-node`'s ability to reset unsafe targets. A comment from @nonsense on July 21st suggested that most actionable items were covered by PR [#16557](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16557) and related PRs, and questioned if further work was needed given upcoming refactoring. The issue was subsequently closed on July 25th, with @nonsense stating it could be re-opened or a new issue created if necessary.
