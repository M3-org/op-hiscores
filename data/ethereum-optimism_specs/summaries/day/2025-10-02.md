# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Oct 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on clarifying specifications for the Fusaka defense mechanism. Additionally, several long-standing issues were closed, including the Isthmus Upgrade tracker and an issue related to op-acceptance-test reporting.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Protocol Specification Refinements
*   A pull request was opened to clarify the specifications for the Fusaka defense mechanism, enhancing the protocol's robustness and security ([#790](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/790)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Upgrade Tracking and Completion
*   The tracker for the Isthmus Upgrade was closed, indicating its completion. Discussions confirmed the upgrade's successful implementation and the resolution of associated tasks ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/12703)).

### Test Infrastructure Enhancements
*   An issue concerning the inclusion of setup information in op-acceptor HTML output was closed, with the resolution implemented in a related infrastructure pull request ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/386)).

### Execution Layer Syncing Conditions
*   An issue investigating the conditions for the L2 Execution Layer (EL) to start syncing was closed. The resolution suggests that EL Syncs after the initial run are handled by `engineController.insertUnsafePayload`, making the ticket's original concern less critical ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17628)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go1.25 Compatibility
Discussion on [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17060) confirms that the Go 1.25 compatibility issue significantly affects Cannon, specifically causing incorrect Keccak hashes and potentially other cryptographic operations. The problem is linked to a blocking issue in the Go toolchain, and while Go 1.25.1 has been released, it does not appear to include the necessary MIPS fix.

### op-acceptance-test: Re-integrating op-reth
The latest comment on [#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17475) suggests that since Kurtosis devnet is deprecated, the focus should shift to integrating `op-reth` into the `devstack` / `sysgo` system instead of adding it back to the Kurtosis devnet. This indicates a change in strategy for testing `op-reth` within the Optimism ecosystem.
