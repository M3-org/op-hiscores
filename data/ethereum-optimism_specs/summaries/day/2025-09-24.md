# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Sep 24, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in refining L1 block attribute transaction choices for the Isthmus and Jovian upgrades, alongside a substantial cleanup of older, no longer relevant issues related to superchain-ops architecture and CI processes.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Protocol Specification Refinements
Precision was added to the L1 block attribute transaction choice within the activation blocks for the Isthmus and Jovian protocol upgrades. This involved updates to the overview, L1 attributes, and system configuration documentation for both protocols.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1224) snag report on improved superchain-ops flow
The discussion revolves around improving the user experience for the superchain-ops signing flow. @geoknee reported several points of confusion, including the printing of "TODOs" during simulation, the experimental nature of audit reports, the requirement for `op-txverify`, and unclear explanations of terms like "normalized state diff hash". @blmalone acknowledged the feedback and created a PR to address some of the snags. They clarified that "TODOs" are intentionally printed during task simulation to aid task developers in creating `VALIDATION.md` files, and that the audit report language will be updated. The need for `op-txverify` is still under discussion, and improvements to boilerplate markdown and explanations of technical terms are being implemented. @geoknee further questioned if signers are expected to simulate tasks, implying that the "TODOs" might still impact their UX.

### [#49](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/49) Make SignFromJson compatible with Safe Web UI
This issue was closed by @blmalone, stating that the architecture has meaningfully changed since its opening. The original discussion from 2024 involved making `SignFromJson` compatible with the Safe Web UI, with suggestions for using `MultiSendCallOnly` or exploring ways to sign arbitrary data in the Safe UI. @mds1 had expressed interest in keeping it open to explore options, and @maurelian had planned to include it in a PR. However, with the architectural changes, the issue is now considered resolved.

### [#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/140) Suggestion: improved proposal ops
This issue was closed by @blmalone, noting that Superchain-ops has implemented a new architecture based on previous discussions. The original suggestion by @ElliotFriedman was to use a framework like `forge-proposal-simulator` to improve governance proposals by enabling explicit validations, integrating with existing integration tests, and writing proposals in readable Solidity instead of JSON. @mds1 had asked for more details on the vision, and @ElliotFriedman provided extensive explanations and examples of the benefits. The closure indicates that the new architecture addresses the
