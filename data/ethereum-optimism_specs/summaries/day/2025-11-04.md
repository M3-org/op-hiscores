# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing the clarity and navigability of contract specifications by linking defined terms to their definitions. Discussions on active issues covered topics from flashblocks support in `sysgo` to blob priority fee tracking and `proxyd`'s handling of out-of-sync backends.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

* **Contract Specification Clarity:**
    * Implemented markdown links for all defined terms within the experimental contract specification documents, improving readability and navigation for developers ([#856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/856)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
* A new pull request, [#855](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/855), was opened to remove unused definitions from experimental contract specifications.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed on this date.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

* **`op-acceptance-tests`: `sysgo` support for flashblocks / rbuilders ([#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16450))**
    * A comment from teddyknox indicated a desire to implement this feature to validate `kona-node` and `rollup-boost` changes.

* **Update `migrate` method ([#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17743))**
    * Inphi clarified that this issue specifically tracks OPCM changes, with devstack changes being handled in a separate issue, suggesting this issue could be closed.
    * ajsutton noted that a recent update to OPCM did not include the devstack changes.

* **`op-batcher/txmgr`: Blob priority fee tracking ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18102))**
    * sebastianst discussed potential approaches for blob priority fee tracking, including a special case where only the batcher's own transactions are considered for estimating the next minimum priority fee. They acknowledged the downside of such an approach, where the batcher would start fresh after a restart.
    * ajsutton suggested a simpler, quicker win: having the starting priority fee for new transactions "decay" from the previous transaction rather than always resetting to the minimum, which could improve backlog handling during busy periods.

* **`proxyd`: backwards time travel is possible when backends are not in sync ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/501))**
    * joshklop highlighted that "backwards time travel" could affect more than just `eth_call`, potentially impacting `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory`.
    * yashvardhan-kukreja brainstormed several approaches to address the issue, including a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call`, `proxyd` handling "block out of range" errors, IP-based sticky sessions, and signature-based sticky sessions. They weighed the pros and cons of each, favoring approach 1 if traffic allows, or approach 2 for its ease of implementation.
