# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing the clarity and navigability of contract specifications by linking defined terms to their definitions. Discussions on active issues covered RPC behavior, blob priority fee tracking, and flashblock support.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Contract Specification Clarity**
    *   Improved readability of contract specifications by adding markdown links for all defined terms within the `specs/experimental/contracts/` directory, ensuring easier navigation to definitions ([#856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/856)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   A new pull request, [#855](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/855), was opened to remove unused definitions from experimental contract specifications.

## CLOSED ISSUES
*   **Optimism Portal Contract Migration**
    *   Issue [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17743), concerning the update of the `migrate` method, was closed. The discussion confirmed that the issue specifically tracked OPCM changes, with devstack changes being handled in a separate issue.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened on this day.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Proxyd Backwards Time Travel** ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/501))
    *   Discussions continued on how to prevent "backwards time travel" in Proxyd when backends are out of sync.
    *   `joshklop` noted that this issue could affect `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory` in addition to `eth_call`.
    *   `yashvardhan-kukreja` brainstormed several approaches:
        *   A "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, fanning out to all backends concurrently.
        *   Proxyd silently falling back to other backends on "block out of range" errors.
        *   IP-based sticky sessions to direct client requests to the same backend.
        *   Signature-based sticky sessions using a tamper-proof, time-bound signature in responses, requiring client-side changes.
    *   `yashvardhan-kukreja` suggested that the multicall strategy (Approach 1) would be ideal if `eth_call` traffic allows, otherwise Approach 2 (falling back on errors) for its ease of implementation.

*   **Blob Priority Fee Tracking** ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18102))
    *   The discussion focused on improving blob priority fee estimation for `op-batcher/txmgr`.
    *   `sebastianst` responded to `ajsutton`'s suggestion of decaying priority fees, noting that while it could be a special case of a more comprehensive solution, it would have the downside of batchers starting fresh after a restart. A dedicated blob priority fee tracker would provide better estimates from the start.

*   **Flashblock Support in `op-acceptance-tests`** ([#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16450))
    *   `teddyknox` expressed the need for `sysgo` to support flashblocks/rbuilders to validate `kona-node` and `rollup-boost` changes.
