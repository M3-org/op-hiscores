## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Flaky Test Investigation
The issue [#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17548) concerning the flaky `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` test has been closed. The latest comment indicates that the test is no longer appearing in the top 100 flaky tests, suggesting the issue has been resolved.

### `op-batcher` Max Frame Size in Generic Mode
Discussion on [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17796) revolves around the `op-batcher`'s max frame size in generic commitment mode. A recent comment highlights that the issue was addressed in a pull request ([#18074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074)) and questions whether the issue can now be closed. Another comment suggests updating the `alt-da.md` specification to reflect the change, as the current spec might be misleading regarding the `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` limit.
