# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Nov 7, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining contract specifications within the `specs/experimental` directory. Key efforts included consolidating duplicate definitions and adding missing definitions for `MintManager` and `AddressManager`, enhancing the clarity and accuracy of the documentation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Contract Specification Refinements
*   **Consolidated Duplicate Definitions:** Eliminated redundant definitions across experimental contract specifications, improving consistency and readability. ([#859](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/859))
*   **Added Missing Definitions:** Included previously missing definitions for `MintManager` and `AddressManager` within the contract specifications, ensuring comprehensive documentation. ([#857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/857))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#858](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/858) Add duplicate definitions analysis report

## CLOSED ISSUES
*   **Flaky Test Resolution:** The `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` test, previously identified as flaky, has been fixed and is no longer appearing in the top flaky tests list. ([#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17548))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
*   **`op-batcher` Max Frame Size in Generic Mode:** Discussion continues regarding the `op-batcher`'s max frame size when using generic commitment mode with alternative DA. A recent comment highlights that the specification might need updating as the current statement regarding `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` for `commitment_type == 0` is now considered false due to a recent fix.
