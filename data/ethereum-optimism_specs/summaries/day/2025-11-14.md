# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Nov 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the introduction of new L2CM specifications and the resolution of two issues related to `op-program` block header lookups and Kona compatibility with websocket URLs in acceptance tests.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#861](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/861), was opened to introduce L2CM specifications.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-program` Block Header Oracle Lookup Hint
Issue [#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17416) was closed. A hint for fast block header oracle lookup was added to `op-program`, though it's not currently used due to reliance on `op-geth`. Kona's different lookup logic, which reads storage slots directly, outputs a similar hint, leading to the closure of this issue.

### Kona Compatibility with Websocket URLs
Issue [#18203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18203) was closed following an update to Kona, resolving its incompatibility with websocket URLs for L2 EL connections in acceptance tests.
