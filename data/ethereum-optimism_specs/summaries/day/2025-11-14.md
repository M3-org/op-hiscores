## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#861](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/861), was opened to add L2CM specifications.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-program` Hint for Fast Block Header Oracle Lookup
Issue [#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/17416) was closed. A hint was added to `op-program` to provide key information for fast block header lookups, although it's not currently used as `op-geth` handles the data via `debug_dbGet`. Kona's different lookup logic, which reads storage slots directly, also outputs a similar hint.

### Kona Compatibility with Websockets URL in Acceptance Tests
Issue [#18203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18203) was closed. This issue addressed the incompatibility between Kona, which did not support websockets for L2 EL connections, and `sys go`, which only provided websocket URLs. The issue was resolved by updating Kona.
