## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Reports
Discussions on [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1148) focused on updating the `print_staging_report` script for dispute-game v2 compatibility. The script currently reads game arguments from the game implementation contract, which needs to be adapted to read from the `gameArgs` storage in the DGF. Concerns were raised about the script's assumption of only Permissioned and Permissionless games, as there will eventually be two permissionless games. The impact of potential JSON output format changes was also noted.

### Support for Embedded Custom Prestes in Kona
Issue [#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/18271) tracks the addition of support for embedded custom prestates to Kona. A fix is currently under review, as indicated by a comment linking to a pull request in the `op-rs/kona` repository.

### Deprecation of Kurtosis for `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack`
Issue [#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/16704), concerning `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` support for `sysext` and deployment in Kurtosis, received a comment stating that Kurtosis is being deprecated. This suggests a shift in the tooling or deployment strategy for these components.
