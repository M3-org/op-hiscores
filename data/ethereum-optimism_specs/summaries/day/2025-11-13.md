## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Reports
Discussions continued on issue [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/1148), "Update print_staging_report script to be dispute-game v2 compatible." The latest comments highlight the need to adapt the script to read `gameArgs` from the DGF, as the current script reads from the game implementation contract. There's also a concern that the script assumes only a Permissioned and Permissionless game, while the new setup will have two permissionless games, potentially causing disruption if the JSON output format changes.
