# ethereum-optimism/specs Daily Update (Jul 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining documentation and specifications, including critical bug fixes for broken links and typos, clarifying API specifications, and general repository maintenance.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation and Specification Refinements
Several updates were made to improve the accuracy and clarity of the project's documentation and specifications. This included fixing a broken link to the EAS.sol repository in the predeploys documentation ([#716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/716)), correcting a typo in `sequencer.md` ([#721](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/721)), and adding an article to `alt-da.md` with minor grammatical corrections ([#704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/704)).

### API Specification Clarifications
The Supervisor API specification was updated to clarify the representation of null or non-existent block references in `syncStatus` method responses, ensuring more robust API interactions ([#739](https://github.ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/739)).

### Repository Maintenance and Cleanup
General maintenance tasks included adding a standardized legal footer to the documentation site ([#595](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/595)), removing the custom gas token feature from the spec as it is no longer being pursued ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/689)), and removing the `CODEOWNERS` file to streamline the review process based on team feedback ([#743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/743)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Congestion-based builder transaction reordering
Issue [#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/issues/306) discusses the need for a design document on congestion-based builder transaction reordering. The latest comment from moonfury-ops at 2025-07-29T20:33:56Z indicates an interest in collaborating on this task, asking for an opportunity to work with the issue creator. This suggests potential progress on defining a mechanism to track and penalize excessive Data Availability (DA) usage, possibly as an external protocol component to test ideas for L1 congestion cost.
