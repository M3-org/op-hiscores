      "body": "# docs(specs): improve GovernanceToken specification\n\n## Summary\n\nThis PR significantly expands the GovernanceToken specification from a minimal 73-line document to a comprehensive 595-line specification that follows the canonical OP Stack spec format. The original spec was incomplete - it only documented 3 functions and lacked critical sections like Invariants, Assumptions, and Dependencies.\n\n**Key additions:**\n- **Definitions section**: Added formal definitions for Voting Power, Delegation, and Checkpoint\n- **Assumptions section**: Documented 4 external dependencies (MintManager enforcement, OpenZeppelin correctness, user understanding, governance query correctness)\n- **Invariants section**: Identified 8 core system properties with severity ratings (4 Critical, 2 High, 2 Medium)\n- **Dependencies section**: Links to ERC20, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes, ERC20Burnable, and Ownable\n- **Function specifications**: Complete specs for all 23 functions (mint, burn, delegation, voting queries, ERC20 standard, ERC20Permit)\n\n**Critical bug fixes:**\n- Fixed `getVotes()` signature - spec said `getVotes()` but actual function is `getVotes(address account)`\n- Added missing documentation for EIP-2612 permit functionality\n- Documented uint224 max supply constraint that prevents overflow\n- Added checkpoint structure details (fromBlock uint32, votes uint224)\n\nThe specification is now complete enough that a developer could implement the GovernanceToken contract from this spec alone without needing to reference the Solidity code.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify invariants are goals, not tactics**: Review the 8 invariants (iGT-001 through iGT-008) and confirm each describes *what must be true* rather than *how it's implemented*. Example: iGT-003 says \"Voting power accurately reflects delegated balances\" (goal) rather than \"Checkpoints are updated on transfers\" (tactic).\n\n- [ ] **Spot-check function specs against contract**: Pick 3-5 functions and verify the specification matches the actual GovernanceToken.sol implementation at `/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/governance/GovernanceToken.sol`. Pay special attention to inherited functions from OpenZeppelin contracts.\n\n- [ ] **Validate `getVotes()` signature fix**: Confirm the function signature is `getVotes(address account)` not `getVotes()` in the OpenZeppelin ERC20Votes contract. The original spec had this wrong.\n\n- [ ] **Review severity ratings**: Check that the Critical/High/Medium severity assignments for the 8 invariants make sense. Critical ratings were assigned to mint authorization, burn authorization, voting power accuracy, and historical immutability.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This is a documentation-only change - no contract code was modified\n- All linting checks pass (markdown formatting, TOC, spelling)\n- Spec was written by analyzing GovernanceToken.sol and inherited OpenZeppelin contracts (ERC20Burnable, ERC20Votes, ERC20Permit, Ownable)\n- The uint224 max supply constraint is enforced by ERC20Votes to prevent checkpoint overflow\n\n**Link to Devin run**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/9c78fee5c11842ff87fe7ed03f78b533  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",

      "body": "# docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create SaferSafes specification\n\n## Summary\nThis PR adds a new canonical specification for SaferSafes at:\n- specs/experimental/contracts/safe/safer-safes.md\n\nThe spec follows the required structure (Overview → Definitions → Assumptions → Invariants → Function Specification) and documents the combined behavior of the LivenessModule2 and TimelockGuard when used together on a Safe (v1.4.1).\n\nHighlights:\n- Overview of the contract’s role: combined liveness challenge module and timelock guard for Safe.\n- Precise Definitions for contract-specific concepts (e.g., Liveness Response Period, Timelock Delay, Cancellation Threshold, Maximum Cancellation Threshold, Blocking Threshold, Scheduled/Pending Transactions).\n- Assumptions focused on external dependencies (notably Safe version compatibility).\n- Non-obvious cross-cutting Invariants, including the combined-config constraint that the liveness response period must be at least twice the timelock delay when both are enabled/configured, ownership transfer atomicity, guard removal upon takeover, scheduling uniqueness, and cancellation threshold bounds/reset.\n- Function Specifications covering all public/external functions of LivenessModule2 and TimelockGuard, using MUST/MUST NOT language. The standard version() function is intentionally omitted per repository guidance.\n\nLocal lint passes:\n- markdownlint, doctoc, cspell, and filename checks all pass locally.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n2–3 items (low-risk docs-only change)\n- [ ] Validate that Assumptions comply with the repo policy. Specifically assess whether a02-001 (Fallback Owner Honesty) and a03-001 (Owner Key Security) are truly required external dependencies or better categorized as context, and if needed, request removal or reclassification.\n- [ ] Confirm that each Invariant is non-obvious and cross-cutting. Pay special attention to:\n  - i01-001 (response period ≥ 2 × timelock delay) correctly scoped to “both enabled and configured,” matching SaferSafes._checkCombinedConfig early-return behavior.\n  - i07-001 (cancellation threshold bounds) reflects intended requirement versus implementation details (increase only if below max).\n- [ ] Decide whether to add this page to specs/SUMMARY.md so it shows in the mdbook navigation (lint doesn’t enforce this; current PR does not update SUMMARY).\n\nRecommended test plan:\n- Run just lint-specs-md-check, just lint-specs-toc-check, just lint-specs-spelling-check to match CI environment.\n- Run mdbook build to ensure the book compiles without errors and verify the page renders if added to SUMMARY.md.\n\n### Notes\n- The spec excludes version() from Function Specification per repo guidance.\n- No “Dependencies” section is included (deprecated).\n- Session: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/f3b501a2e19b4ccdbdf0145a9c5c1388\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co), GitHub: @aliersh",

The specification follows the canonical OP Stack format with Overview, Definitions, Assumptions, Invariants, and Function Specification sections.\n\n**Key additions:**\n- 4 definitions: Game UUID, Game Implementation, Initialization Bond, Game Clone\n- 2 assumptions about owner governance and implementation validity\n- 2 invariants: game uniqueness enforcement and registry consistency\n- Complete function specifications for all 11 public/external functions (excluding `version()`)\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Validate invariant selection** - I identified only 2 invariants. Per spec guidelines, are these the right ones? Should there be more? Specifically:\n  - Is \"game uniqueness\" (iDGF-001) truly a cross-function property, or just a single-function check that belongs in the `create` function spec?\n  - Is \"registry consistency\" (iDGF-002) appropriately scoped?\n- [ ] **Verify severity ratings** - I assigned High to game uniqueness and Medium to registry consistency. Do these align with OP Stack's risk framework?\n- [ ] **Check technical accuracy** - Review the `create` function specification (lines 186-210) to ensure my description of the CWIA clone creation flow matches the actual implementation\n- [ ] **Confirm completeness** - Are there any important cross-function properties or behaviors I missed? Compare against the actual contract at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol`\n\n### Notes\n\n- All linting checks pass (markdown, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- This is a new spec, not an improvement of an existing one - only the interface was previously documented\n- The spec is placed in `experimental/contracts/dispute/` per the file location guidelines\n\n**Session**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/fd12b322e1a64d41b5d6dc69bf779257  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) - @aliersh",

      "body": "# Improve DeputyPauseModule specification\n\n## Summary\n\nThis PR significantly improves the DeputyPauseModule specification by restructuring it to follow the canonical format mandated by the specs repository guidelines. The changes include:\n\n- **Relocated** specification from `specs/protocol/` to `specs/experimental/contracts/safe/` to match contract location structure\n- **Removed deprecated sections**: Status, Context, Upgradeability, and Dependencies subsections under each invariant\n- **Added Definitions section** with contract-specific terms (Deputy, Pause Identifier)\n- **Streamlined Assumptions** from 8 to 3 by removing non-dependencies:\n  - Removed governance process assumptions (aSCP-001/002/003) - these are off-chain context, not contract dependencies\n  - Removed trivial assumptions (aDPM-005/006: \"OpenZeppelin/Safe are bug-free\", aDPM-008: \"Deputy can sign\")\n  - Removed deployment assumption (aDPM-001: \"configured correctly\")\n  - Kept only runtime external dependencies (key security, censorship resistance)\n- **Consolidated invariants** from 7 to 4 by removing system-level goals that the contract doesn't enforce:\n  - Removed iSCP-001 (\"pause within 30 minutes\") - this is a system goal, not a contract-enforced property\n  - Removed iDPM-005 (\"Foundation Safe can change Deputy\") - already covered in setDeputy function spec\n  - Kept only non-obvious security properties the contract must maintain\n- **Added missing function specifications** for guardianSafe() and usedNonces mapping\n- **Improved function specs** with clearer MUST/MUST NOT requirements in single behavior list (no subsections)\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n**⚠️ Risk Level: MEDIUM** - This is a substantial documentation refactor that removes significant content. Manual verification required.\n\n- [ ] **CRITICAL: Check if old spec should be deleted** - The original spec at `specs/protocol/deputy-pause-module.md` still exists. Decide if it should be deleted, updated to redirect, or if both specs should coexist for some reason. Having two specs for the same contract could cause confusion.\n\n- [ ] **Verify removed assumptions were truly non-essential** - I removed 5 assumptions based on guidelines (governance process details, trivial \"contracts work correctly\" statements). Confirm these weren't critical for understanding the security model.\n\n- [ ] **Verify removed invariants were truly non-enforced properties** - I removed iSCP-001 (30-minute activation time) as a \"system goal\" rather than contract-enforced property, and iDPM-005 (Foundation can change Deputy) as redundant with setDeputy spec. Confirm this reasoning is sound.\n\n- [ ] **Spot-check function specs against contract** - Compare a few function specifications (especially `pause` and `setDeputy`) against the actual contract at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/safe/DeputyPauseModule.sol` to verify accuracy.\n\n### Test Plan\n\nSince this is documentation:\n1. Review the contract code at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/safe/DeputyPauseModule.sol` alongside the new spec\n2. Verify each function specification matches the actual implementation\n3. Confirm invariants capture the non-obvious security properties\n4. Ensure no critical security properties were lost in the restructuring\n\n### Notes\n\n- All linting checks pass (markdown format, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- Followed canonical format: Overview → Definitions → Assumptions → Invariants → Function Specification\n- Excluded `version()` function per guidelines (standard ISemver)\n- Used definition references ([Deputy](#deputy)) throughout for DRY principle\n\n**Session Info:**\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) (@aliersh)\n- Session URL: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/0672f348947b40478751f459427d858f",

The LivenessModule enables permissionless removal of inactive Safe owners based on liveness data from the LivenessGuard, with a shutdown mechanism that transfers ownership to a fallback owner when the owner count falls too low.\n\n**Key sections:**\n- **Definitions**: 5 core concepts (Liveness Interval, Minimum Owners, Threshold Percentage, Fallback Owner, Shutdown)\n- **Assumptions**: 2 external dependencies (LivenessGuard accuracy, fallback owner trusted)\n- **Invariants**: 4 high-level security properties (threshold maintenance, live owner protection, non-live owner removal, shutdown triggering)\n- **Function Specification**: All 10 public/external functions documented (constructor + 9 functions; version() excluded per guidelines)\n\n**Changes from initial draft:**\n- Simplified assumption a02-002 from \"governance-controlled\" to \"trusted\" per feedback\n- Refocused invariants on higher-level properties rather than implementation details per feedback\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **CRITICAL: Verify spec matches contract implementation** - Cross-reference the spec against `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/safe/LivenessModule.sol`, especially:\n  - The `removeOwners` function behavior and its shutdown transition logic\n  - The `_verifyFinalState` checks and what they enforce\n  - The threshold calculation formula in `getRequiredThreshold`\n- [ ] **Validate invariants are truly cross-function** - Ensure the 4 invariants span multiple functions and aren't just documenting single-function access control or parameter validation (per strict spec guidelines)\n- [ ] **Check shutdown mechanism accuracy** - The spec describes how the module transitions from normal removal mode to shutdown mode when owner count drops below MIN_OWNERS. Verify this matches `_removeOwner`, `_swapToFallbackOwnerSafeCall`, and the for-loop logic in `removeOwners`\n- [ ] **Verify assumptions are actual dependencies** - Confirm the 2 assumptions (LivenessGuard accuracy, fallback owner trust) are truly external dependencies required for the contract to function correctly\n\n### Notes\n\nThis specification was created from scratch (no existing LivenessModule spec existed in the specs repo, only a high-level description in `safe-extensions.md`).
