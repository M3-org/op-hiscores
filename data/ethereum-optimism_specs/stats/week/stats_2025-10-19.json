      "body": "# docs(specs): improve GovernanceToken specification\n\n## Summary\n\nThis PR significantly expands the GovernanceToken specification from a minimal 73-line document to a comprehensive 595-line specification that follows the canonical OP Stack spec format. The original spec was incomplete - it only documented 3 functions and lacked critical sections like Invariants, Assumptions, and Dependencies.\n\n**Key additions:**\n- **Definitions section**: Added formal definitions for Voting Power, Delegation, and Checkpoint\n- **Assumptions section**: Documented 4 external dependencies (MintManager enforcement, OpenZeppelin correctness, user understanding, governance query correctness)\n- **Invariants section**: Identified 8 core system properties with severity ratings (4 Critical, 2 High, 2 Medium)\n- **Dependencies section**: Links to ERC20, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes, ERC20Burnable, and Ownable\n- **Function specifications**: Complete specs for all 23 functions (mint, burn, delegation, voting queries, ERC20 standard, ERC20Permit)\n\n**Critical bug fixes:**\n- Fixed `getVotes()` signature - spec said `getVotes()` but actual function is `getVotes(address account)`\n- Added missing documentation for EIP-2612 permit functionality\n- Documented uint224 max supply constraint that prevents overflow\n- Added checkpoint structure details (fromBlock uint32, votes uint224)\n\nThe specification is now complete enough that a developer could implement the GovernanceToken contract from this spec alone without needing to reference the Solidity code.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify invariants are goals, not tactics**: Review the 8 invariants (iGT-001 through iGT-008) and confirm each describes *what must be true* rather than *how it's implemented*. Example: iGT-003 says \"Voting power accurately reflects delegated balances\" (goal) rather than \"Checkpoints are updated on transfers\" (tactic).\n\n- [ ] **Spot-check function specs against contract**: Pick 3-5 functions and verify the specification matches the actual GovernanceToken.sol implementation at `/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/governance/GovernanceToken.sol`. Pay special attention to inherited functions from OpenZeppelin contracts.\n\n- [ ] **Validate `getVotes()` signature fix**: Confirm the function signature is `getVotes(address account)` not `getVotes()` in the OpenZeppelin ERC20Votes contract. The original spec had this wrong.\n\n- [ ] **Review severity ratings**: Check that the Critical/High/Medium severity assignments for the 8 invariants make sense. Critical ratings were assigned to mint authorization, burn authorization, voting power accuracy, and historical immutability.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This is a documentation-only change - no contract code was modified\n- All linting checks pass (markdown formatting, TOC, spelling)\n- Spec was written by analyzing GovernanceToken.sol and inherited OpenZeppelin contracts (ERC20Burnable, ERC20Votes, ERC20Permit, Ownable)\n- The uint224 max supply constraint is enforced by ERC20Votes to prevent checkpoint overflow\n\n**Link to Devin run**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/9c78fee5c11842ff87fe7ed03f78b533  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",

      "body": "# Create MintManager Specification\n\n## Summary\n\nThis PR adds a comprehensive specification for the `MintManager` contract (`src/governance/MintManager.sol`), which controls governance token inflation. The spec follows the canonical OP Stack format with:\n\n- **2 definitions**: Mint Cap (2%) and Mint Period (365 days) - referenced throughout via markdown links\n- **4 assumptions**: GovernanceToken implementation, block timestamp reliability, owner governance behavior, valid successor\n- **4 invariants**: Mint cap enforcement (Medium), time-based restrictions (Medium), exclusive authority (Critical), ownership control (Critical)\n- **3 function specifications**: constructor, mint, upgrade with MUST/MUST NOT requirements\n\n**Important divergence**: The spec documents INTENDED behavior where all mints have restrictions. The current contract has a bug where the first mint (`mintPermittedAfter == 0`) bypasses checks. Per reviewer, the spec should describe desired future behavior and the contract will be fixed later.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\nThis is a **yellow risk** PR (documentation only, but accuracy is critical):\n\n- [ ] **Verify intentional spec-to-contract divergence is acceptable**: Spec states all mints have restrictions (lines 116-158), but current contract allows first mint to bypass checks (see `if (mintPermittedAfter > 0)` in `MintManager.sol:46-53`). Confirm documenting intended future behavior is correct approach.\n- [ ] **Verify constants exactly match contract**: Check that MINT_CAP = 20, DENOMINATOR = 1000 (2%), MINT_PERIOD = 365 days match `MintManager.sol:21-28` character-for-character\n- [ ] **Validate severity ratings**: Review whether Medium (not Critical) is appropriate for iMM-001 and iMM-002, given they require governance assumption (aMM-003) to fail. Reviewer iterated: Critical → High → Medium.\n- [ ] **Confirm invariants are goals, not tactics**: Read iMM-001 through iMM-004 (lines 115-195) and verify they state \"what must be true\" rather than \"how it's implemented\"\n- [ ] **Verify completeness**: Confirm all public/external functions from MintManager.sol are documented (constructor, mint, upgrade)\n\n### Notes\n\n- All linting checks pass (markdown format, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- Added MintManager entry to SUMMARY.md navigation under Governance section\n- Addressed multiple rounds of reviewer feedback:\n  - Simplified overview to remove implementation details\n  - Formatted definitions as section headings per spec conventions\n  - Moved valid successor from invariants to assumptions\n  - Adjusted severity ratings based on governance dependency\n  - Removed duplicate function spec sections and specific error messages\n- No code changes, only documentation\n- Contract location: `/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/governance/MintManager.sol`\n\nSession requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) | [@aliersh](https://github.com/aliersh)  \nLink to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/d07e0c4e6a9344f6b4857e324aa07883",

      "number": 807,
      "body": "# docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create L1FeeVault specification\n\n## Summary\n\nCreates a comprehensive specification for the L1FeeVault predeploy contract at `0x420000000000000000000000000000000000001A`. This contract accumulates the L1 portion of transaction fees (data availability costs) and enables permissionless withdrawal to a designated recipient once a minimum threshold is reached.\n\nThe specification follows the canonical OP Stack format with:\n- **Overview**: High-level description of the contract's role\n- **Definitions**: Minimum Withdrawal Amount and Withdrawal Network\n- **Assumptions**: 3 external dependencies (recipient validity, L2ToL1MessagePasser correctness, protocol fee crediting)\n- **Invariants**: 2 core security properties (fee withdrawal availability, authorized recipient only)\n- **Function Specification**: Complete MUST/MUST NOT specifications for all public/external functions\n\n**Note**: This PR went through multiple review iterations. The Dependencies section was removed and invariants were simplified from 5 to 2 to focus on core contract behavior rather than implementation details, per reviewer feedback.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify withdraw() function specification matches actual implementation** - This is the most complex function with dual-path logic (L1 via L2ToL1MessagePasser vs L2 via SafeCall.send). Compare against [`FeeVault.sol`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/FeeVault.sol) lines 87-109 to ensure all behaviors are accurately captured, especially error cases.\n- [ ] **Validate the 2 invariants capture essential security properties** - After simplification from 5 to 2 invariants, confirm that i01-001 (fee withdrawal availability) and i01-002 (authorized recipient only) truly represent the \"heart\" of the contract's security model. Consider if any critical security properties were lost in the simplification.\n- [ ] **Check assumptions against actual system design** - Verify that a01-003 (protocol fee crediting) accurately describes how the execution engine routes L1 fees to this contract. Confirm the coinbase mechanism mentioned is the actual implementation.\n- [ ] **Review edge cases and failure modes** - The spec should describe what happens when SafeCall.send fails (line 219-220 says \"MUST revert if transfer fails\"). Verify this matches implementation and no edge cases are missing.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This is a documentation-only PR - no contract code was created or modified\n- The spec is designed to be comprehensive enough for someone to implement the contract from scratch\n- Invariants were intentionally simplified to focus on core behavior per @smartcontracts review feedback (removed implementation details like totalProcessed counter, full balance transfer requirement, immutable configuration)\n- Session: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/993fc64c987c4dc0b8dcd4345061e5af\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh\n\nLast update: 2025-10-22 13:18 ET\n",

This contract is a legacy proxy that dynamically resolves its implementation address through the AddressManager contract, maintaining backwards compatibility with pre-Bedrock versions of the Optimism system.\n\nThe specification includes:\n- Overview explaining the contract's role as a legacy proxy with dynamic implementation resolution\n- Two assumptions about AddressManager behavior and storage layout compatibility\n- Two invariants covering implementation address resolution and configuration immutability\n- Complete function specifications for constructor and fallback function\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify assumption categorization**: Is `a01-002` (storage layout compatibility) truly an external dependency, or is it more of a design constraint? The playbook is strict about assumptions being REQUIRED external dependencies only.\n\n- [ ] **Check invariant appropriateness**: Is `i01-002` (immutable configuration) too obvious to be an invariant? Since there are no functions to modify these values, this might fail the \"well, obviously\" test from the playbook.\n\n- [ ] **Confirm technical accuracy**: Review the function specifications against the actual contract source code at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/legacy/ResolvedDelegateProxy.sol` to ensure all behaviors are correctly documented.\n\n- [ ] **Verify spec completeness**: Could someone implement this contract from the spec alone? Check that the unusual storage pattern (using `address(this)` as mapping key) is adequately explained.\n\n### Notes\n\n- All linting checks pass (markdown, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- No existing spec was found in the repository, so this was created from scratch\n- The spec correctly links to the existing AddressManager specification\n- Legacy contract, so real-world testing isn't applicable - this is documentation only\n\n**Session**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/df9661e5fbc746edaefcbd044071621a  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",
