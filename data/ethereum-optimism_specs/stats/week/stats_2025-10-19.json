      "body": "# docs(specs): improve GovernanceToken specification\n\n## Summary\n\nThis PR significantly expands the GovernanceToken specification from a minimal 73-line document to a comprehensive 595-line specification that follows the canonical OP Stack spec format. The original spec was incomplete - it only documented 3 functions and lacked critical sections like Invariants, Assumptions, and Dependencies.\n\n**Key additions:**\n- **Definitions section**: Added formal definitions for Voting Power, Delegation, and Checkpoint\n- **Assumptions section**: Documented 4 external dependencies (MintManager enforcement, OpenZeppelin correctness, user understanding, governance query correctness)\n- **Invariants section**: Identified 8 core system properties with severity ratings (4 Critical, 2 High, 2 Medium)\n- **Dependencies section**: Links to ERC20, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes, ERC20Burnable, and Ownable\n- **Function specifications**: Complete specs for all 23 functions (mint, burn, delegation, voting queries, ERC20 standard, ERC20Permit)\n\n**Critical bug fixes:**\n- Fixed `getVotes()` signature - spec said `getVotes()` but actual function is `getVotes(address account)`\n- Added missing documentation for EIP-2612 permit functionality\n- Documented uint224 max supply constraint that prevents overflow\n- Added checkpoint structure details (fromBlock uint32, votes uint224)\n\nThe specification is now complete enough that a developer could implement the GovernanceToken contract from this spec alone without needing to reference the Solidity code.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify invariants are goals, not tactics**: Review the 8 invariants (iGT-001 through iGT-008) and confirm each describes *what must be true* rather than *how it's implemented*. Example: iGT-003 says \"Voting power accurately reflects delegated balances\" (goal) rather than \"Checkpoints are updated on transfers\" (tactic).\n\n- [ ] **Spot-check function specs against contract**: Pick 3-5 functions and verify the specification matches the actual GovernanceToken.sol implementation at `/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/governance/GovernanceToken.sol`. Pay special attention to inherited functions from OpenZeppelin contracts.\n\n- [ ] **Validate `getVotes()` signature fix**: Confirm the function signature is `getVotes(address account)` not `getVotes()` in the OpenZeppelin ERC20Votes contract. The original spec had this wrong.\n\n- [ ] **Review severity ratings**: Check that the Critical/High/Medium severity assignments for the 8 invariants make sense. Critical ratings were assigned to mint authorization, burn authorization, voting power accuracy, and historical immutability.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This is a documentation-only change - no contract code was modified\n- All linting checks pass (markdown formatting, TOC, spelling)\n- Spec was written by analyzing GovernanceToken.sol and inherited OpenZeppelin contracts (ERC20Burnable, ERC20Votes, ERC20Permit, Ownable)\n- The uint224 max supply constraint is enforced by ERC20Votes to prevent checkpoint overflow\n\n**Link to Devin run**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/9c78fee5c11842ff87fe7ed03f78b533  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",

      "body": "# docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create SaferSafes specification\n\n## Summary\nThis PR adds a new canonical specification for SaferSafes at:\n- specs/experimental/contracts/safe/safer-safes.md\n\nThe spec follows the required structure (Overview → Definitions → Assumptions → Invariants → Function Specification) and documents the combined behavior of the LivenessModule2 and TimelockGuard when used together on a Safe (v1.4.1).\n\nHighlights:\n- Overview of the contract’s role: combined liveness challenge module and timelock guard for Safe.\n- Precise Definitions for contract-specific concepts (e.g., Liveness Response Period, Timelock Delay, Cancellation Threshold, Maximum Cancellation Threshold, Blocking Threshold, Scheduled/Pending Transactions).\n- Assumptions focused on external dependencies (notably Safe version compatibility).\n- Non-obvious cross-cutting Invariants, including the combined-config constraint that the liveness response period must be at least twice the timelock delay when both are enabled/configured, ownership transfer atomicity, guard removal upon takeover, scheduling uniqueness, and cancellation threshold bounds/reset.\n- Function Specifications covering all public/external functions of LivenessModule2 and TimelockGuard, using MUST/MUST NOT language. The standard version() function is intentionally omitted per repository guidance.\n\nLocal lint passes:\n- markdownlint, doctoc, cspell, and filename checks all pass locally.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n2–3 items (low-risk docs-only change)\n- [ ] Validate that Assumptions comply with the repo policy. Specifically assess whether a02-001 (Fallback Owner Honesty) and a03-001 (Owner Key Security) are truly required external dependencies or better categorized as context, and if needed, request removal or reclassification.\n- [ ] Confirm that each Invariant is non-obvious and cross-cutting. Pay special attention to:\n  - i01-001 (response period ≥ 2 × timelock delay) correctly scoped to “both enabled and configured,” matching SaferSafes._checkCombinedConfig early-return behavior.\n  - i07-001 (cancellation threshold bounds) reflects intended requirement versus implementation details (increase only if below max).\n- [ ] Decide whether to add this page to specs/SUMMARY.md so it shows in the mdbook navigation (lint doesn’t enforce this; current PR does not update SUMMARY).\n\nRecommended test plan:\n- Run just lint-specs-md-check, just lint-specs-toc-check, just lint-specs-spelling-check to match CI environment.\n- Run mdbook build to ensure the book compiles without errors and verify the page renders if added to SUMMARY.md.\n\n### Notes\n- The spec excludes version() from Function Specification per repo guidance.\n- No “Dependencies” section is included (deprecated).\n- Session: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/f3b501a2e19b4ccdbdf0145a9c5c1388\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co), GitHub: @aliersh",

DelayedWETH is a WETH extension that enforces time-delayed withdrawals and provides emergency recovery mechanisms for the Fault Dispute Game bond system.\n\n**Key components:**\n- **Overview**: High-level description of DelayedWETH's role in holding dispute game bonds\n- **Definitions**: Withdrawal Delay, Sub-Account, and Withdrawal Request concepts\n- **Assumptions**: Owner governance constraints and SuperchainConfig pause state dependency\n- **Invariants**: Withdrawal delay enforcement and owner emergency intervention capability\n- **Function Specification**: Complete documentation of all public/external functions (except `version()`)\n\nAlso added `reinitializer` to `words.txt` for spell checking and alphabetically sorted the file.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\nThis is a documentation-only change with moderate risk of misalignment between spec and implementation. Please verify:\n\n- [ ] **Function specifications accurately match contract implementation** - Compare each function's documented behavior against the actual DelayedWETH.sol contract code, especially the `unlock()`, `withdraw()`, `recover()`, and `hold()` functions\n- [ ] **Invariants capture the critical security properties** - Review whether the two invariants (delay enforcement and owner intervention) correctly represent the contract's most important non-obvious security guarantees\n- [ ] **Assumptions are complete** - Verify that external dependencies on Owner behavior and SuperchainConfig are accurately captured and no other critical assumptions are missing\n- [ ] **Severity ratings are appropriate** - Confirm that \"High\" severity for both invariants is correct given they depend on assumption failures\n- [ ] **Definitions are clear and useful** - Check that Sub-Account, Withdrawal Delay, and Withdrawal Request definitions will help readers understand the spec\n\n### Test Plan\nSince this is documentation, test by:\n1. Reading the spec alongside the contract implementation in `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DelayedWETH.sol`\n2. Verifying all documented behaviors match the actual code\n3. Checking that someone unfamiliar with the contract could implement it from this spec alone\n\n### Notes\n- This specification follows the canonical format without a \"Dependencies\" section (deprecated)\n- Excluded `version()` function per specification guidelines\n- No existing DelayedWETH spec was found in the repository\n- Related documentation exists in `specs/fault-proof/stage-one/bond-incentives.md` which describes how DelayedWETH integrates with the Fault Dispute Game\n\n---\n\n**Link to Devin run**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/e9dd7451d51d47e2822b784154686502  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) (@aliersh)",

The spec follows the canonical OP Stack format with:\n\n- **2 definitions**: Mint Cap (2%) and Mint Period (365 days) - referenced throughout via markdown links\n- **4 assumptions**: GovernanceToken implementation, block timestamp reliability, owner governance behavior, valid successor\n- **4 invariants**: Mint cap enforcement (Medium), time-based restrictions (Medium), exclusive authority (Critical), ownership control (Critical)\n- **3 function specifications**: constructor, mint, upgrade with MUST/MUST NOT requirements\n\n**Important divergence**: The spec documents INTENDED behavior where all mints have restrictions. The current contract has a bug where the first mint (`mintPermittedAfter == 0`) bypasses checks. Per reviewer, the spec should describe desired future behavior and the contract will be fixed later.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\nThis is a **yellow risk** PR (documentation only, but accuracy is critical):\n\n- [ ] **Verify intentional spec-to-contract divergence is acceptable**: Spec states all mints have restrictions (lines 116-158), but current contract allows first mint to bypass checks (see `if (mintPermittedAfter > 0)` in `MintManager.sol:46-53`). Confirm documenting intended future behavior is correct approach.\n- [ ] **Verify constants exactly match contract**: Check that MINT_CAP = 20, DENOMINATOR = 1000 (2%), MINT_PERIOD = 365 days match `MintManager.sol:21-28` character-for-character\n- [ ] **Validate severity ratings**: Review whether Medium (not Critical) is appropriate for iMM-001 and iMM-002, given they require governance assumption (aMM-003) to fail. Reviewer iterated: Critical → High → Medium.\n- [ ] **Confirm invariants are goals, not tactics**: Read iMM-001 through iMM-004 (lines 115-195) and verify they state \"what must be true\" rather than \"how it's implemented\"\n- [ ] **Verify completeness**: Confirm all public/external functions from MintManager.sol are documented (constructor, mint, upgrade)\n\n### Notes\n\n- All linting checks pass (markdown format, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- Added MintManager entry to SUMMARY.md navigation under Governance section\n- Addressed multiple rounds of reviewer feedback:\n  - Simplified overview to remove implementation details\n  - Formatted definitions as section headings per spec conventions\n  - Moved valid successor from invariants to assumptions\n  - Adjusted severity ratings based on governance dependency\n  - Removed duplicate function spec sections and specific error messages\n- No code changes, only documentation\n- Contract location: `/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/governance/MintManager.sol`\n\nSession requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) | [@aliersh](https://github.com/aliersh)  \nLink to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/d07e0c4e6a9344f6b4857e324aa07883",
