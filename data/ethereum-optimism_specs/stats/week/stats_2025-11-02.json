This specification covers five contract variants that share the core bisection-based dispute resolution mechanism but differ in access control and architectural implementation:\n\n- **FaultDisputeGame**: Base permissionless V1 implementation\n- **PermissionedDisputeGame**: Permissioned V1 with proposer/challenger roles\n- **SuperPermissionedDisputeGame**: Permissioned variant extending SuperFaultDisputeGame\n- **FaultDisputeGameV2**: Permissionless V2 using Immutable Args Pattern\n- **PermissionedDisputeGameV2**: Permissioned V2 with Immutable Args Pattern\n\nThe specification includes:\n- Overview and Contract Variants sections explaining the family\n- 9 Definitions (including Proposer Role, Challenger Role, Immutable Args Pattern)\n- 3 Assumptions about external dependencies (AnchorStateRegistry, VM, DelayedWETH)\n- 7 Invariants including new i01-007 for permissioned access control\n- Complete function specifications for 30+ public/external functions\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify multi-variant approach**: Confirm that documenting all 5 variants in a single specification (rather than separate specs) aligns with documentation standards and makes sense for maintainability\n- [ ] **Cross-check permission model**: Review invariant i01-007 and the permission-related updates to `initialize()`, `step()`, and `move()` functions against actual contract code to ensure accuracy, especially the distinction between which variants have which restrictions\n- [ ] **Validate V2 architectural changes**: Check that the Immutable Args Pattern definition and V2-specific behaviors (especially in `initialize()` with variable calldata length) accurately reflect the architectural refactoring\n- [ ] **Review invariants for completeness**: Verify that the 7 invariants capture all critical cross-function security properties, particularly around game resolution, bond distribution, and access control\n- [ ] **Spot-check function behaviors**: Select 3-5 critical functions (e.g., `resolveClaim`, `closeGame`, `challengeRootL2Block`) and verify their MUST/MUST NOT requirements match actual contract implementation\n\n### Notes\n\nThis specification was created entirely from code analysis without ability to test against actual deployments. The spec attempts to be comprehensive but may have missed subtle edge cases or variant-specific behaviors that aren't immediately obvious from code reading alone. Pay particular attention to areas where behavior differs between variants (especially V1 vs V2 and permissioned vs permissionless).\n\n**Session**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/5f4083160bbf44b5bf07eb21550b9af7  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",

      "body": "# docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create GovernanceToken specification\n\n## Summary\n\nCreated a comprehensive specification for the GovernanceToken contract following the canonical format. The spec documents the ERC20 governance token with voting/delegation capabilities (ERC20Votes) and controlled minting through the MintManager owner. Key sections include:\n\n- **Overview**: High-level description of the token's role in OP Stack governance\n- **Assumptions**: Owner governance constraints and ERC20Votes supply limits\n- **Invariants**: 3 invariants covering voting power accuracy, transfer freedom, and minting authorization\n- **Function Specification**: Complete documentation of all public/external functions including mint, burn/burnFrom, delegation (delegate, delegateBySig), voting queries (getVotes, getPastVotes, etc.), and standard ERC20/ERC20Permit functions\n\nThe spec is based on the actual contract implementation at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/governance/GovernanceToken.sol`, which is a straightforward composition of OpenZeppelin contracts (ERC20Burnable, ERC20Votes, Ownable) with a custom owner-only mint function.\n\n**Note**: An experimental spec existed at `/specs/experimental/gov-token.md` describing GovernanceDelegation integration, but this was NOT implemented in the actual contract, so I based this spec on the simpler `/specs/governance/gov-token.md` and the actual contract code.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify inherited function behaviors are accurate**: The spec documents behavior from OpenZeppelin's ERC20Votes, ERC20Permit, and ERC20Burnable. Spot-check that documented behaviors (especially voting power updates, delegation mechanics, and signature validation) match the actual OpenZeppelin implementations used by the contract.\n\n- [ ] **Review invariant classification**: Particularly iGT-003 (\"Unauthorized minting is impossible\") - confirm this is appropriate as an invariant rather than just being in the mint() function spec. The guidelines allow critical security properties in either location, but worth double-checking.\n\n- [ ] **Validate assumptions are true external dependencies**: Especially aGT-002 about the ERC20Votes total supply constraint - is this really an \"assumption\" (external dependency) or just a technical limitation of the inherited implementation?\n\n- [ ] **Confirm no experimental features were included**: The experimental spec at `/specs/experimental/gov-token.md` describes GovernanceDelegation hook integration that doesn't exist in the actual contract. Verify this spec correctly documents only what's actually implemented.\n\n### Notes\n\n- All lint checks passed (markdown, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- Excluded `version()` function from spec as per guidelines (standard ISemver)\n- Used N/A for Definitions since all terms are standard ERC20/voting concepts\n- Placed spec at `/specs/experimental/contracts/governance/governance-token.md` following the path mapping rules\n\n**Session**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/85e0ab1d881c4a94b1ee4d43614b20f3  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co), GitHub: @aliersh",

Please validate the specification against the actual contract implementation:\n\n- [ ] **Verify invariants are accurate**: Review each of the 4 invariants (i01-001 through i01-004) against the MIPS64 contract code to ensure they are actually maintained across all functions. Pay special attention to thread stack management and memory reservation logic.\n\n- [ ] **Check function specifications completeness**: The `step()` function has complex behavior (syscalls, threading, RMW operations). Verify that all critical behaviors are documented and no edge cases are missing. Cross-reference with the contract code at lines 126-288.\n\n- [ ] **Validate assumptions**: Confirm that the two assumptions (PreimageOracle validity and proof data well-formedness) capture all critical external dependencies. Are there other contracts or systems this contract depends on?\n\n- [ ] **Review definitions accuracy**: Verify that the definitions (especially Thread Stack and Memory Reservation) accurately describe the mechanisms used in the contract. Check that the link to the Cannon VM spec works and is appropriate.\n\n- [ ] **Check for missing invariants**: The contract has complex multithreading logic. Are there other cross-function properties that should be documented as invariants (e.g., related to state versions, step counters, or preemption)?\n\n### Notes\n\n- This specification was created by analyzing the MIPS64 contract source code\n- All linting checks passed (markdown, TOC, spelling)\n- The spec follows the canonical format for contract specifications in the OP Stack\n- Link to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/09a707f4ca8940ee8180dbef97af6448\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) @aliersh",

      "body": "# Add SuperFaultDisputeGame variant to FaultDisputeGame specification\n\n## Summary\n\nAdded SuperFaultDisputeGame as the 6th variant to the FaultDisputeGame specification. SuperFaultDisputeGame is a permissionless variant designed for interoperability that validates super root claims using L2 sequence numbers (timestamps) instead of L2 block numbers. The specification now documents how SuperFaultDisputeGame differs from standard variants in initialization, data access, and state tracking.\n\n**Key changes:**\n- Updated Overview and Contract Variants sections to include SuperFaultDisputeGame (changed from 5 to 6 variants)\n- Added two new definitions: \"Super Root\" (cross-chain state commitment) and \"L2 Sequence Number\" (timestamp-based identifier)\n- Updated function specifications to document SuperFaultDisputeGame-specific behaviors:\n  - `initialize`: Added validation rules for INVALID_ROOT_CLAIM constant and L2 chain ID must be zero\n  - `l2SequenceNumber`: Documents timestamp behavior in SuperFaultDisputeGame vs block number in standard variants\n  - `startingRootHash`: Documents use of startingProposal instead of startingOutputRoot\n  - `addLocalData`: Documents DISPUTED_L2_BLOCK_NUMBER loading l2SequenceNumber\n- Added `startingSequenceNumber` function spec (only exists in SuperFaultDisputeGame variants)\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify SuperFaultDisputeGame description accuracy**: Cross-check the variant description against actual SuperFaultDisputeGame.sol contract and interop design docs to ensure the purpose and key differences are accurately captured\n- [ ] **Validate function specifications**: Review all updated function specs (initialize, l2SequenceNumber, startingRootHash, startingSequenceNumber, addLocalData) against SuperFaultDisputeGame.sol source code to verify technical accuracy\n- [ ] **Check for completeness**: Verify no other SuperFaultDisputeGame-specific functions or behaviors are missing from the spec (e.g., are there other functions that behave differently in SuperFaultDisputeGame?)\n- [ ] **Verify technical details**: Confirm offset values (88 for l2SequenceNumber), constant names (INVALID_ROOT_CLAIM), validation rules (L2 chain ID must be zero), and data structure references (startingProposal vs startingOutputRoot) are correct\n\n### Notes\n\nThis specification was created by analyzing the SuperFaultDisputeGame.sol contract code. The definitions for \"Super Root\" and \"L2 Sequence Number\" are based on code comments and behavior, so they should be reviewed by someone familiar with the interop design to ensure they accurately reflect the intended interop concepts.\n\n**Session**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/5f4083160bbf44b5bf07eb21550b9af7  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",
