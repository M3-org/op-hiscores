      "body": "# docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create L1StandardBridge specification\n\n## Summary\n\nCreated a comprehensive specification for the L1StandardBridge contract following the canonical OP Stack specification format. This spec documents the L1 side of the standard bridge system that enables ETH and ERC20 token transfers between Ethereum L1 and OP Stack L2 chains.\n\n**Key sections:**\n- **Overview**: High-level description of the bridge's role in escrow and token handling\n- **Definitions**: OptimismMintableERC20 and Native L1 Token concepts\n- **Assumptions**: 4 trust assumptions about L2StandardBridge, L1CrossDomainMessenger, SystemConfig/SuperchainConfig, and token implementations\n- **Invariants**: 3 critical security properties (deposit liveness, withdrawal liveness, one-to-one custody)\n- **Function Specification**: Complete documentation of all 19 public/external functions (excluding version())\n\nThis spec mirrors the structure and patterns established in the existing L2StandardBridge specification.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify invariants are accurate**: Review the 3 invariants (i01-001 through i01-003) against the actual L1StandardBridge.sol contract code to ensure they correctly capture the critical security properties. Pay special attention to the one-to-one custody invariant.\n- [ ] **Check assumptions completeness**: Verify the 4 assumptions cover all external dependencies. Consider whether additional assumptions are needed around unsupported token types (transfer fees, rebasing, blocklists mentioned in contract comments).\n- [ ] **Spot-check function specifications**: Pick 3-5 functions (especially finalize functions and initialization) and verify the MUST/MUST NOT statements match the actual implementation, including revert conditions and event emissions.\n- [ ] **Verify L1/L2 terminology**: Scan through the spec to ensure \"L1\" and \"L2\" are used correctly throughout (easy to mix up when using L2StandardBridge as template).\n\n### Test Plan\nSince this is documentation only:\n1. Read through the spec alongside the L1StandardBridge.sol contract\n2. Verify the spec would be sufficient for someone to implement the contract from scratch\n3. Check that the spec is consistent with the existing L2StandardBridge spec (they should be mirrors with L1/L2 swapped)\n\n### Notes\n- Pattern followed: Used existing L2StandardBridge spec as template for structure and format\n- All markdown linting checks passed (TOC generation, markdown format, spelling, filenames)\n- No code changes - documentation only\n- Link to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/8d4a6a3943514dfdb21ea27c059d9482\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",

      "body": "# docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create PreimageOracle specification\n\n## Summary\n\nCreated a comprehensive specification for the PreimageOracle contract, which provides data availability for fault proof execution. The spec covers:\n\n- **Standard preimage routes**: local data, keccak256, sha256, blob (with KZG proofs), and precompile results\n- **Large Preimage Proposal (LPP) system**: For preimages too large to submit in a single transaction, including incremental merkleization with keccak256 state commitments, challenge mechanism, and bond-based security\n- **5 invariants**: Data integrity, proposal finality, challenge correctness, bond conservation, and local data isolation\n- **2 assumptions**: Challenger monitoring and sufficient gas for precompile calls\n- **16 function specifications**: All public/external functions except `version()`\n\nAdded 3 new words to the dictionary: `merkleization`, `incentivizes`, `returndatasize`.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\nThis is a **yellow risk** PR (new specification from scratch). Please verify:\n\n- [ ] **Invariants are truly cross-function properties**: Review each of the 5 invariants (i01-001 through i01-005) to ensure they describe system-wide properties that span multiple functions, not single-function behaviors. Pay special attention to i01-005 (Local Data Isolation) - verify it's genuinely cross-function.\n\n- [ ] **Large Preimage Proposal flow is accurately specified**: The LPP system is the most complex part. Verify the sequence `initLPP → addLeavesLPP → (optional challenge) → squeezeLPP` is correctly described, especially:\n  - Merkle tree construction and verification requirements\n  - State commitment validation in challenge functions\n  - Conditions for successful challenges vs. successful squeeze\n\n- [ ] **Function specifications match contract behavior**: Cross-reference key functions against the actual contract code, especially:\n  - `loadBlobPreimagePart` - KZG proof verification flow\n  - `addLeavesLPP` - Merkle tree updates and preimage part extraction\n  - `challengeLPP` / `challengeFirstLPP` / `squeezeLPP` - State matrix validation logic\n\n### Test Plan\n\n1. Review the spec against the contract source: `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/PreimageOracle.sol`\n2. Verify all public/external functions are documented (except `version()`)\n3. Check that assumptions a01-001 and a01-002 accurately reflect external dependencies\n4. Confirm invariant severity ratings align with actual security impact\n5. Validate that function specifications provide sufficient detail for implementation\n\n### Notes\n\n- All linting checks passed (markdown, TOC, spelling)\n- No Dependencies section included (as it's deprecated per guidelines)\n- Session: [Devin run](https://app.devin.ai/sessions/ae338f6f7a0846ba82a3e3aaa5ce8f86)\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (@aliersh)",

The specification follows the canonical OP Stack format with Overview, Definitions, Assumptions, Invariants, and Function Specification sections.\n\n**Key additions:**\n- 4 definitions: Game UUID, Game Implementation, Initialization Bond, Game Clone\n- 2 assumptions about owner governance and implementation validity\n- 2 invariants: game uniqueness enforcement and registry consistency\n- Complete function specifications for all 11 public/external functions (excluding `version()`)\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Validate invariant selection** - I identified only 2 invariants. Per spec guidelines, are these the right ones? Should there be more? Specifically:\n  - Is \"game uniqueness\" (iDGF-001) truly a cross-function property, or just a single-function check that belongs in the `create` function spec?\n  - Is \"registry consistency\" (iDGF-002) appropriately scoped?\n- [ ] **Verify severity ratings** - I assigned High to game uniqueness and Medium to registry consistency. Do these align with OP Stack's risk framework?\n- [ ] **Check technical accuracy** - Review the `create` function specification (lines 186-210) to ensure my description of the CWIA clone creation flow matches the actual implementation\n- [ ] **Confirm completeness** - Are there any important cross-function properties or behaviors I missed? Compare against the actual contract at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol`\n\n### Notes\n\n- All linting checks pass (markdown, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- This is a new spec, not an improvement of an existing one - only the interface was previously documented\n- The spec is placed in `experimental/contracts/dispute/` per the file location guidelines\n\n**Session**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/fd12b322e1a64d41b5d6dc69bf779257  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) - @aliersh",
