      "body": "# Create comprehensive FaultDisputeGame specification covering all variants\n\n## Summary\n\nCreated a new contract specification for the FaultDisputeGame family at `specs/experimental/contracts/dispute/fault-dispute-game.md`. This specification covers five contract variants that share the core bisection-based dispute resolution mechanism but differ in access control and architectural implementation:\n\n- **FaultDisputeGame**: Base permissionless V1 implementation\n- **PermissionedDisputeGame**: Permissioned V1 with proposer/challenger roles\n- **SuperPermissionedDisputeGame**: Permissioned variant extending SuperFaultDisputeGame\n- **FaultDisputeGameV2**: Permissionless V2 using Immutable Args Pattern\n- **PermissionedDisputeGameV2**: Permissioned V2 with Immutable Args Pattern\n\nThe specification includes:\n- Overview and Contract Variants sections explaining the family\n- 9 Definitions (including Proposer Role, Challenger Role, Immutable Args Pattern)\n- 3 Assumptions about external dependencies (AnchorStateRegistry, VM, DelayedWETH)\n- 7 Invariants including new i01-007 for permissioned access control\n- Complete function specifications for 30+ public/external functions\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify multi-variant approach**: Confirm that documenting all 5 variants in a single specification (rather than separate specs) aligns with documentation standards and makes sense for maintainability\n- [ ] **Cross-check permission model**: Review invariant i01-007 and the permission-related updates to `initialize()`, `step()`, and `move()` functions against actual contract code to ensure accuracy, especially the distinction between which variants have which restrictions\n- [ ] **Validate V2 architectural changes**: Check that the Immutable Args Pattern definition and V2-specific behaviors (especially in `initialize()` with variable calldata length) accurately reflect the architectural refactoring\n- [ ] **Review invariants for completeness**: Verify that the 7 invariants capture all critical cross-function security properties, particularly around game resolution, bond distribution, and access control\n- [ ] **Spot-check function behaviors**: Select 3-5 critical functions (e.g., `resolveClaim`, `closeGame`, `challengeRootL2Block`) and verify their MUST/MUST NOT requirements match actual contract implementation\n\n### Notes\n\nThis specification was created entirely from code analysis without ability to test against actual deployments. The spec attempts to be comprehensive but may have missed subtle edge cases or variant-specific behaviors that aren't immediately obvious from code reading alone. Pay particular attention to areas where behavior differs between variants (especially V1 vs V2 and permissioned vs permissionless).\n\n**Session**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/5f4083160bbf44b5bf07eb21550b9af7  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",

      "body": "# docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create L1StandardBridge specification\n\n## Summary\n\nCreated a comprehensive specification for the L1StandardBridge contract following the canonical OP Stack specification format. This spec documents the L1 side of the standard bridge system that enables ETH and ERC20 token transfers between Ethereum L1 and OP Stack L2 chains.\n\n**Key sections:**\n- **Overview**: High-level description of the bridge's role in escrow and token handling\n- **Definitions**: OptimismMintableERC20 and Native L1 Token concepts\n- **Assumptions**: 4 trust assumptions about L2StandardBridge, L1CrossDomainMessenger, SystemConfig/SuperchainConfig, and token implementations\n- **Invariants**: 3 critical security properties (deposit liveness, withdrawal liveness, one-to-one custody)\n- **Function Specification**: Complete documentation of all 19 public/external functions (excluding version())\n\nThis spec mirrors the structure and patterns established in the existing L2StandardBridge specification.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify invariants are accurate**: Review the 3 invariants (i01-001 through i01-003) against the actual L1StandardBridge.sol contract code to ensure they correctly capture the critical security properties. Pay special attention to the one-to-one custody invariant.\n- [ ] **Check assumptions completeness**: Verify the 4 assumptions cover all external dependencies. Consider whether additional assumptions are needed around unsupported token types (transfer fees, rebasing, blocklists mentioned in contract comments).\n- [ ] **Spot-check function specifications**: Pick 3-5 functions (especially finalize functions and initialization) and verify the MUST/MUST NOT statements match the actual implementation, including revert conditions and event emissions.\n- [ ] **Verify L1/L2 terminology**: Scan through the spec to ensure \"L1\" and \"L2\" are used correctly throughout (easy to mix up when using L2StandardBridge as template).\n\n### Test Plan\nSince this is documentation only:\n1. Read through the spec alongside the L1StandardBridge.sol contract\n2. Verify the spec would be sufficient for someone to implement the contract from scratch\n3. Check that the spec is consistent with the existing L2StandardBridge spec (they should be mirrors with L1/L2 swapped)\n\n### Notes\n- Pattern followed: Used existing L2StandardBridge spec as template for structure and format\n- All markdown linting checks passed (TOC generation, markdown format, spelling, filenames)\n- No code changes - documentation only\n- Link to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/8d4a6a3943514dfdb21ea27c059d9482\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",

      "body": "# docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create PreimageOracle specification\n\n## Summary\n\nCreated a comprehensive specification for the PreimageOracle contract, which provides data availability for fault proof execution. The spec covers:\n\n- **Standard preimage routes**: local data, keccak256, sha256, blob (with KZG proofs), and precompile results\n- **Large Preimage Proposal (LPP) system**: For preimages too large to submit in a single transaction, including incremental merkleization with keccak256 state commitments, challenge mechanism, and bond-based security\n- **5 invariants**: Data integrity, proposal finality, challenge correctness, bond conservation, and local data isolation\n- **2 assumptions**: Challenger monitoring and sufficient gas for precompile calls\n- **16 function specifications**: All public/external functions except `version()`\n\nAdded 3 new words to the dictionary: `merkleization`, `incentivizes`, `returndatasize`.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\nThis is a **yellow risk** PR (new specification from scratch). Please verify:\n\n- [ ] **Invariants are truly cross-function properties**: Review each of the 5 invariants (i01-001 through i01-005) to ensure they describe system-wide properties that span multiple functions, not single-function behaviors. Pay special attention to i01-005 (Local Data Isolation) - verify it's genuinely cross-function.\n\n- [ ] **Large Preimage Proposal flow is accurately specified**: The LPP system is the most complex part. Verify the sequence `initLPP → addLeavesLPP → (optional challenge) → squeezeLPP` is correctly described, especially:\n  - Merkle tree construction and verification requirements\n  - State commitment validation in challenge functions\n  - Conditions for successful challenges vs. successful squeeze\n\n- [ ] **Function specifications match contract behavior**: Cross-reference key functions against the actual contract code, especially:\n  - `loadBlobPreimagePart` - KZG proof verification flow\n  - `addLeavesLPP` - Merkle tree updates and preimage part extraction\n  - `challengeLPP` / `challengeFirstLPP` / `squeezeLPP` - State matrix validation logic\n\n### Test Plan\n\n1. Review the spec against the contract source: `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/PreimageOracle.sol`\n2. Verify all public/external functions are documented (except `version()`)\n3. Check that assumptions a01-001 and a01-002 accurately reflect external dependencies\n4. Confirm invariant severity ratings align with actual security impact\n5. Validate that function specifications provide sufficient detail for implementation\n\n### Notes\n\n- All linting checks passed (markdown, TOC, spelling)\n- No Dependencies section included (as it's deprecated per guidelines)\n- Session: [Devin run](https://app.devin.ai/sessions/ae338f6f7a0846ba82a3e3aaa5ce8f86)\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (@aliersh)",

The spec documents the ERC20 governance token with voting/delegation capabilities (ERC20Votes) and controlled minting through the MintManager owner. Key sections include:\n\n- **Overview**: High-level description of the token's role in OP Stack governance\n- **Assumptions**: Owner governance constraints and ERC20Votes supply limits\n- **Invariants**: 3 invariants covering voting power accuracy, transfer freedom, and minting authorization\n- **Function Specification**: Complete documentation of all public/external functions including mint, burn/burnFrom, delegation (delegate, delegateBySig), voting queries (getVotes, getPastVotes, etc.), and standard ERC20/ERC20Permit functions\n\nThe spec is based on the actual contract implementation at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/governance/GovernanceToken.sol`, which is a straightforward composition of OpenZeppelin contracts (ERC20Burnable, ERC20Votes, Ownable) with a custom owner-only mint function.\n\n**Note**: An experimental spec existed at `/specs/experimental/gov-token.md` describing GovernanceDelegation integration, but this was NOT implemented in the actual contract, so I based this spec on the simpler `/specs/governance/gov-token.md` and the actual contract code.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify inherited function behaviors are accurate**: The spec documents behavior from OpenZeppelin's ERC20Votes, ERC20Permit, and ERC20Burnable. Spot-check that documented behaviors (especially voting power updates, delegation mechanics, and signature validation) match the actual OpenZeppelin implementations used by the contract.\n\n- [ ] **Review invariant classification**: Particularly iGT-003 (\"Unauthorized minting is impossible\") - confirm this is appropriate as an invariant rather than just being in the mint() function spec. The guidelines allow critical security properties in either location, but worth double-checking.\n\n- [ ] **Validate assumptions are true external dependencies**: Especially aGT-002 about the ERC20Votes total supply constraint - is this really an \"assumption\" (external dependency) or just a technical limitation of the inherited implementation?\n\n- [ ] **Confirm no experimental features were included**: The experimental spec at `/specs/experimental/gov-token.md` describes GovernanceDelegation hook integration that doesn't exist in the actual contract. Verify this spec correctly documents only what's actually implemented.\n\n### Notes\n\n- All lint checks passed (markdown, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- Excluded `version()` function from spec as per guidelines (standard ISemver)\n- Used N/A for Definitions since all terms are standard ERC20/voting concepts\n- Placed spec at `/specs/experimental/contracts/governance/governance-token.md` following the path mapping rules\n\n**Session**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/85e0ab1d881c4a94b1ee4d43614b20f3  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co), GitHub: @aliersh",
