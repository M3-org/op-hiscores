      "body": "# Create DisputeGameFactory specification\n\n## Summary\n\nThis PR adds a comprehensive specification for the `DisputeGameFactory` contract, which serves as the central registry and factory for creating dispute game contracts in the OP Stack fault proof system. The specification follows the canonical OP Stack format with Overview, Definitions, Assumptions, Invariants, and Function Specification sections.\n\n**Key additions:**\n- 4 definitions: Game UUID, Game Implementation, Initialization Bond, Game Clone\n- 2 assumptions about owner governance and implementation validity\n- 2 invariants: game uniqueness enforcement and registry consistency\n- Complete function specifications for all 11 public/external functions (excluding `version()`)\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Validate invariant selection** - I identified only 2 invariants. Per spec guidelines, are these the right ones? Should there be more? Specifically:\n  - Is \"game uniqueness\" (iDGF-001) truly a cross-function property, or just a single-function check that belongs in the `create` function spec?\n  - Is \"registry consistency\" (iDGF-002) appropriately scoped?\n- [ ] **Verify severity ratings** - I assigned High to game uniqueness and Medium to registry consistency. Do these align with OP Stack's risk framework?\n- [ ] **Check technical accuracy** - Review the `create` function specification (lines 186-210) to ensure my description of the CWIA clone creation flow matches the actual implementation\n- [ ] **Confirm completeness** - Are there any important cross-function properties or behaviors I missed? Compare against the actual contract at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol`\n\n### Notes\n\n- All linting checks pass (markdown, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- This is a new spec, not an improvement of an existing one - only the interface was previously documented\n- The spec is placed in `experimental/contracts/dispute/` per the file location guidelines\n\n**Session**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/fd12b322e1a64d41b5d6dc69bf779257  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) - @aliersh",

      "number": 828,
      "body": "# docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create LivenessModule specification\n\n## Summary\n\nCreated a comprehensive specification for the `LivenessModule` contract following the canonical OP Stack specification format. The LivenessModule enables permissionless removal of inactive Safe owners based on liveness data from the LivenessGuard, with a shutdown mechanism that transfers ownership to a fallback owner when the owner count falls too low.\n\n**Key sections:**\n- **Definitions**: 5 core concepts (Liveness Interval, Minimum Owners, Threshold Percentage, Fallback Owner, Shutdown)\n- **Assumptions**: 2 external dependencies (LivenessGuard accuracy, fallback owner trusted)\n- **Invariants**: 4 high-level security properties (threshold maintenance, live owner protection, non-live owner removal, shutdown triggering)\n- **Function Specification**: All 10 public/external functions documented (constructor + 9 functions; version() excluded per guidelines)\n\n**Changes from initial draft:**\n- Simplified assumption a02-002 from \"governance-controlled\" to \"trusted\" per feedback\n- Refocused invariants on higher-level properties rather than implementation details per feedback\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **CRITICAL: Verify spec matches contract implementation** - Cross-reference the spec against `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/safe/LivenessModule.sol`, especially:\n  - The `removeOwners` function behavior and its shutdown transition logic\n  - The `_verifyFinalState` checks and what they enforce\n  - The threshold calculation formula in `getRequiredThreshold`\n- [ ] **Validate invariants are truly cross-function** - Ensure the 4 invariants span multiple functions and aren't just documenting single-function access control or parameter validation (per strict spec guidelines)\n- [ ] **Check shutdown mechanism accuracy** - The spec describes how the module transitions from normal removal mode to shutdown mode when owner count drops below MIN_OWNERS. Verify this matches `_removeOwner`, `_swapToFallbackOwnerSafeCall`, and the for-loop logic in `removeOwners`\n- [ ] **Verify assumptions are actual dependencies** - Confirm the 2 assumptions (LivenessGuard accuracy, fallback owner trust) are truly external dependencies required for the contract to function correctly\n\n### Notes\n\nThis specification was created from scratch (no existing LivenessModule spec existed in the specs repo, only a high-level description in `safe-extensions.md`). The spec is placed in `/specs/experimental/contracts/safe/` to match the contract location and follows the kebab-case naming convention.\n\nAll linting checks pass (markdown format, TOC, spelling, filenames). CI checks pass.\n\n**Devin session**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/9a519cdc0bee44f4a984dcbbf3fa051c  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh\n\nLast update: 2025-10-24 16:19 ET",

The specification follows the canonical format with sections for Overview, Definitions, Assumptions, Invariants, and Function Specifications.\n\n**Key sections added:**\n- **4 Definitions**: Message Hash, Message Nonce, Address Aliasing, and Failed Message\n- **2 Assumptions**: Trust relationships with L1CrossDomainMessenger and L2ToL1MessagePasser\n- **4 Invariants**: Message replay protection (Critical), Failed message replay capability (High), Message nonce monotonicity (High), and Cross-chain message authentication (Critical)\n- **10 Function Specifications**: Complete coverage of all public/external functions including the complex `relayMessage` function\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify invariants are truly cross-function properties**: Review i01-001 through i01-004 to ensure they represent non-obvious behavioral properties spanning multiple functions, not just single-function checks. Pay special attention to i01-004 (authentication) - is this a true invariant or just relayMessage behavior?\n- [ ] **Cross-check relayMessage specification accuracy**: The relayMessage function has complex branching logic with many edge cases (version checks, replay detection, reentrancy protection, gas checks). Verify the specification matches the actual contract implementation in `/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol` and the base `CrossDomainMessenger.sol`.\n- [ ] **Validate assumptions are necessary dependencies**: Confirm the two assumptions (a01-001 and a01-002) represent actual external dependencies the contract relies on, not just contextual information.\n- [ ] **Review completeness against base contract**: Since L2CrossDomainMessenger inherits from CrossDomainMessenger, verify all inherited public functions are properly documented and no critical behaviors were missed.\n\n### Test Plan\n1. Compare the specification against the actual contract source code line-by-line for accuracy\n2. Verify all linting checks pass (already confirmed in development)\n3. Build the mdbook to ensure the specification renders correctly: `cd ~/repos/specs && mdbook build`\n\n### Notes\n- Specification created from contract at: `/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol`\n- Also analyzed the base `CrossDomainMessenger` contract to understand full functionality\n- All linting checks passed: markdown formatting, TOC generation, spelling, and filename validation\n- Link to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/6cce1e2074cf421eb6145155c3ed162d\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",

The guideline states invariants must span multiple functions - if a property can be enforced by a single require() in one function, it belongs in Function Specification. Consider whether these should be demoted to function-level behaviors.\n\n- [ ] **Validate relayMessage specification against implementation**: The `relayMessage` function has complex branching logic with many edge cases (version 0/1 handling, replay detection, reentrancy protection via xDomainMsgSender check, gas validation, estimation address special handling). Cross-reference the specification in this PR against the actual implementation in `/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol` and base `CrossDomainMessenger.sol` to ensure all edge cases and state transitions are accurately documented.\n\n- [ ] **Consider whether Definitions section should include key terms**: The spec currently has \"N/A\" for definitions. However, terms like \"Message Hash\" (versioned hash computed from message parameters), \"Address Aliasing\" (L1→L2 address transformation), \"Failed Message\" (message marked in failedMessages mapping), and \"Message Nonce\" (versioned nonce with upper 2 bytes) are used throughout the spec and could be considered contract-specific concepts worth defining. Previous closed PR #834 included these definitions - evaluate whether they should be added for clarity.\n\n- [ ] **Verify function specification completeness**: Confirm all public/external functions are documented. The spec covers 11 functions but double-check against the contract interface and base `CrossDomainMessenger` to ensure no inherited public functions were missed.\n\n### Test Plan\n1. Compare the specification line-by-line against actual contract source code:\n   - `/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol` (20 lines)\n   - `/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol` (443 lines of base functionality)\n2. Verify all linting checks pass: `cd ~/repos/specs && just lint-specs-md-check && just lint-specs-toc-check && just lint-specs-spelling-check && just lint-filenames-check`\n3. Build the mdbook to ensure proper rendering: `cd ~/repos/specs && mdbook build`\n\n### Notes\n- Specification created from contract at: `/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/L2CrossDomainMessenger.sol`\n- Also analyzed base `CrossDomainMessenger` contract for inherited functionality  \n- All linting checks passed locally\n- Previous PR #834 with similar content was closed by @aliersh for \"testing prompt changes\" - this version follows updated guidelines with stronger focus on cross-function invariants vs single-function behaviors\n- Link to Devin run: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/b6f6af2a0dd940419f5253d73b91a49f\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh\n\nLast update: 2025-10-27 15:21 ET",
