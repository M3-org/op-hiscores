      "author": "devin-ai-integration",
      "number": 807,
      "body": "# docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create L1FeeVault specification\n\n## Summary\n\nCreates a comprehensive specification for the L1FeeVault predeploy contract at `0x420000000000000000000000000000000000001A`. This contract accumulates the L1 portion of transaction fees (data availability costs) and enables permissionless withdrawal to a designated recipient once a minimum threshold is reached.\n\nThe specification follows the canonical OP Stack format with:\n- **Overview**: High-level description of the contract's role\n- **Definitions**: Minimum Withdrawal Amount and Withdrawal Network\n- **Assumptions**: 3 external dependencies (recipient validity, L2ToL1MessagePasser correctness, protocol fee crediting)\n- **Invariants**: 2 core security properties (fee withdrawal availability, authorized recipient only)\n- **Function Specification**: Complete MUST/MUST NOT specifications for all public/external functions\n\n**Note**: This PR went through multiple review iterations. The Dependencies section was removed and invariants were simplified from 5 to 2 to focus on core contract behavior rather than implementation details, per reviewer feedback.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify withdraw() function specification matches actual implementation** - This is the most complex function with dual-path logic (L1 via L2ToL1MessagePasser vs L2 via SafeCall.send). Compare against [`FeeVault.sol`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/FeeVault.sol) lines 87-109 to ensure all behaviors are accurately captured, especially error cases.\n- [ ] **Validate the 2 invariants capture essential security properties** - After simplification from 5 to 2 invariants, confirm that i01-001 (fee withdrawal availability) and i01-002 (authorized recipient only) truly represent the \"heart\" of the contract's security model. Consider if any critical security properties were lost in the simplification.\n- [ ] **Check assumptions against actual system design** - Verify that a01-003 (protocol fee crediting) accurately describes how the execution engine routes L1 fees to this contract. Confirm the coinbase mechanism mentioned is the actual implementation.\n- [ ] **Review edge cases and failure modes** - The spec should describe what happens when SafeCall.send fails (line 219-220 says \"MUST revert if transfer fails\"). Verify this matches implementation and no edge cases are missing.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This is a documentation-only PR - no contract code was created or modified\n- The spec is designed to be comprehensive enough for someone to implement the contract from scratch\n- Invariants were intentionally simplified to focus on core behavior per @smartcontracts review feedback (removed implementation details like totalProcessed counter, full balance transfer requirement, immutable configuration)\n- Session: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/993fc64c987c4dc0b8dcd4345061e5af\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh\n\nLast update: 2025-10-22 13:18 ET\n",

This contract is a legacy proxy that dynamically resolves its implementation address through the AddressManager contract, maintaining backwards compatibility with pre-Bedrock versions of the Optimism system.\n\nThe specification includes:\n- Overview explaining the contract's role as a legacy proxy with dynamic implementation resolution\n- Two assumptions about AddressManager behavior and storage layout compatibility\n- Two invariants covering implementation address resolution and configuration immutability\n- Complete function specifications for constructor and fallback function\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify assumption categorization**: Is `a01-002` (storage layout compatibility) truly an external dependency, or is it more of a design constraint? The playbook is strict about assumptions being REQUIRED external dependencies only.\n\n- [ ] **Check invariant appropriateness**: Is `i01-002` (immutable configuration) too obvious to be an invariant? Since there are no functions to modify these values, this might fail the \"well, obviously\" test from the playbook.\n\n- [ ] **Confirm technical accuracy**: Review the function specifications against the actual contract source code at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/legacy/ResolvedDelegateProxy.sol` to ensure all behaviors are correctly documented.\n\n- [ ] **Verify spec completeness**: Could someone implement this contract from the spec alone? Check that the unusual storage pattern (using `address(this)` as mapping key) is adequately explained.\n\n### Notes\n\n- All linting checks pass (markdown, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- No existing spec was found in the repository, so this was created from scratch\n- The spec correctly links to the existing AddressManager specification\n- Legacy contract, so real-world testing isn't applicable - this is documentation only\n\n**Session**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/df9661e5fbc746edaefcbd044071621a  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",

The contract is extremely simple - it only stores message commitment hashes in a mapping without any validation or access control.\n\nThe specification follows the canonical OP Stack spec format and includes:\n- Overview of the contract's deprecated status and historical role\n- Two assumptions about migration completeness and alternative bridge compatibility\n- Two invariants: message commitment immutability and unrestricted access (both Low severity given deprecated status)\n- Function specifications for `passMessageToL1` and `sentMessages` (note: `version` function removed per review feedback)\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify technical accuracy**: Confirm the message hash formula `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_message, msg.sender))` matches the actual contract implementation at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/legacy/LegacyMessagePasser.sol`\n- [ ] **Validate historical context**: Confirm the claims about Bedrock migration and the contract's deprecated status are accurate\n- [ ] **Review severity ratings**: Both invariants are marked \"Low\" severity - confirm this is appropriate for a deprecated contract that's no longer used for finalization\n- [ ] **Check format compliance**: Verify the spec follows the canonical format (invariants as goals not tactics, MUST/MUST NOT language, proper use of assumptions vs invariants, etc.)\n\n### Notes\n\n- **Devin Session**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/6a5fa6dcb58a4e63a9c0e22334d879b6\n- **Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh\n- The contract source is only 27 lines and extremely simple, making this a straightforward specification\n- Placed in `/specs/experimental/contracts/legacy/` following the path mapping rules (stripped `src/` prefix, used kebab-case)\n- No definitions needed since the contract uses only standard blockchain terminology\n- All linting checks pass (markdown format, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n\nLast update: 2025-10-22 11:39 ET",
