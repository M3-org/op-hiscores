      "body": "# Add duplicate definitions analysis report\n\n## Summary\nAdds a comprehensive analysis document identifying duplicated definitions across all 31 markdown files in `specs/experimental/contracts/`. The analysis found 1 duplicate term (\"Message Nonce\") defined in both L1CrossDomainMessenger and L2ToL1MessagePasser specifications.\n\nThe document provides:\n- Detailed findings with file locations and line numbers\n- Recommendations for addressing the duplication\n- Summary statistics showing low duplication rate (1 duplicate out of 60+ terms)\n- Complete inventory of all 31 files analyzed\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Document placement**: Verify that placing this analysis at the repository root is appropriate, or if it should live elsewhere (e.g., `docs/analysis/`, or integrated into mdbook)\n- [ ] **Analysis accuracy**: Review the identified duplicate (\"Message Nonce\" in l1-cross-domain-messenger.md and l2-to-l1-message-passer.md) to confirm whether these definitions should actually be consolidated or if they're legitimately different in their respective contexts\n- [ ] **Actionability**: Determine if this analysis should trigger follow-up work to consolidate/cross-reference the duplicate definition, or if the current state is acceptable\n\n### Notes\n\nThis is purely a documentation addition with no functional changes to the specifications themselves. The analysis was performed by systematically reading all markdown files and comparing definitions across the \"Definitions\" sections.\n\nThe finding of only 1 duplicate out of 60+ defined terms suggests the codebase already follows good practices for avoiding unnecessary definition duplication. However, the identified duplicate may warrant attention since both L1 and L2 messenger contracts define \"Message Nonce\" with slightly different technical details.\n\n**Session info:** Requested by Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co)\n**Devin session:** https://app.devin.ai/sessions/deb56deaa5dd46c1bb946cb3d257dedd",

      "body": "# Add missing definitions and link terms for MintManager and AddressManager\n\n## Summary\n\nThis PR addresses missing definitions identified during a systematic review of all 31 contract specification documents in `specs/experimental/contracts/`. Two definitions were added:\n\n1. **MintManager** definition added to `governance/governance-token.md` - Defines the contract that owns the GovernanceToken and enforces minting rate limits\n2. **AddressManager** definition added to `legacy/resolved-delegate-proxy.md` - Defines the legacy registry contract used for address resolution in pre-Bedrock systems\n\nAll occurrences of these terms throughout their respective documents have been linked to their definitions using markdown anchor links (e.g., `[MintManager](#mintmanager)`).\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify definition accuracy**: Review the MintManager and AddressManager definitions to ensure they accurately describe these contracts' roles and behavior in the OP Stack system\n- [ ] **Check rendered markdown**: View the rendered spec pages to confirm all links work correctly and navigate to the right definition anchors\n- [ ] **Verify link completeness**: Scan both documents to ensure no occurrences of \"MintManager\" or \"AddressManager\" were missed that should have been linked\n\n### Test Plan\n1. Render the specs locally or view in PR preview\n2. Click each linked term (e.g., `[MintManager](#mintmanager)`) to verify it jumps to the correct definition\n3. Search for unlinked occurrences of \"MintManager\" and \"AddressManager\" in both files to confirm all appropriate uses are linked\n\n### Notes\n\n- Existing external links like `[AddressManager](./address-manager.md)` were left unchanged per the linking rules (don't link inside existing markdown links)\n- The TOC for both files was automatically updated by doctoc to include the new definition entries\n- All lint checks (markdown, TOC, spelling, filenames) pass\n\n---\n\n**Link to Devin run**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/15b57e4b74fb45e980dbd30868e0c5ad  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh  \n**Last update**: 2025-01-07 05:11 ET",

      "number": 859,
      "body": "# Consolidate duplicate definitions across contract specs\n\n## Summary\nThis PR eliminates duplicate definitions in the experimental contract specifications by consolidating them into single canonical locations and adding cross-file links. Two duplicate definitions were identified and resolved:\n\n1. **Message Nonce**: The definition was duplicated in both `l1-cross-domain-messenger.md` and `l2-to-l1-message-passer.md`. Consolidated by keeping the more detailed definition in `l2-to-l1-message-passer.md` and replacing the duplicate with a link.\n\n2. **AddressManager**: The definition was duplicated in `resolved-delegate-proxy.md` while `address-manager.md` (the actual contract spec) had \"N/A\" for definitions. Added a new \"Address Registry\" definition to `address-manager.md` and updated `resolved-delegate-proxy.md` to link to it instead of duplicating.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n- [ ] Verify that the cross-file markdown links work correctly when viewing the rendered documentation (most important - test both `../L2/l2-to-l1-message-passer.md#message-nonce` and `./address-manager.md#address-registry`)\n- [ ] Review the new \"Address Registry\" definition in `address-manager.md` for accuracy and completeness - does it accurately describe what AddressManager does?\n- [ ] Check that readers have enough context when following the links - do the linked definitions make sense standalone without the surrounding text from the original location?\n\n### Notes\n- All linting checks passed locally (markdown, TOC, spelling)\n- TOC was automatically updated by doctoc to include the new \"Address Registry\" entry\n- This change improves maintainability by establishing single sources of truth for shared concepts across the specs\n\n**Session Info:**\n- Devin session: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/a0cc3287ed0e4ab292ccbf131cdd05e5\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",
