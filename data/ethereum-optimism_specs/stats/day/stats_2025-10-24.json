      "body": "# Create DisputeGameFactory specification\n\n## Summary\n\nThis PR adds a comprehensive specification for the `DisputeGameFactory` contract, which serves as the central registry and factory for creating dispute game contracts in the OP Stack fault proof system. The specification follows the canonical OP Stack format with Overview, Definitions, Assumptions, Invariants, and Function Specification sections.\n\n**Key additions:**\n- 4 definitions: Game UUID, Game Implementation, Initialization Bond, Game Clone\n- 2 assumptions about owner governance and implementation validity\n- 2 invariants: game uniqueness enforcement and registry consistency\n- Complete function specifications for all 11 public/external functions (excluding `version()`)\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Validate invariant selection** - I identified only 2 invariants. Per spec guidelines, are these the right ones? Should there be more? Specifically:\n  - Is \"game uniqueness\" (iDGF-001) truly a cross-function property, or just a single-function check that belongs in the `create` function spec?\n  - Is \"registry consistency\" (iDGF-002) appropriately scoped?\n- [ ] **Verify severity ratings** - I assigned High to game uniqueness and Medium to registry consistency. Do these align with OP Stack's risk framework?\n- [ ] **Check technical accuracy** - Review the `create` function specification (lines 186-210) to ensure my description of the CWIA clone creation flow matches the actual implementation\n- [ ] **Confirm completeness** - Are there any important cross-function properties or behaviors I missed? Compare against the actual contract at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol`\n\n### Notes\n\n- All linting checks pass (markdown, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- This is a new spec, not an improvement of an existing one - only the interface was previously documented\n- The spec is placed in `experimental/contracts/dispute/` per the file location guidelines\n\n**Session**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/fd12b322e1a64d41b5d6dc69bf779257  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) - @aliersh",

      "number": 825,
      "body": "# Improve DeputyPauseModule specification\n\n## Summary\n\nThis PR significantly improves the DeputyPauseModule specification by restructuring it to follow the canonical format mandated by the specs repository guidelines. The changes include:\n\n- **Relocated** specification from `specs/protocol/` to `specs/experimental/contracts/safe/` to match contract location structure\n- **Removed deprecated sections**: Status, Context, Upgradeability, and Dependencies subsections under each invariant\n- **Added Definitions section** with contract-specific terms (Deputy, Pause Identifier)\n- **Streamlined Assumptions** from 8 to 3 by removing non-dependencies:\n  - Removed governance process assumptions (aSCP-001/002/003) - these are off-chain context, not contract dependencies\n  - Removed trivial assumptions (aDPM-005/006: \"OpenZeppelin/Safe are bug-free\", aDPM-008: \"Deputy can sign\")\n  - Removed deployment assumption (aDPM-001: \"configured correctly\")\n  - Kept only runtime external dependencies (key security, censorship resistance)\n- **Consolidated invariants** from 7 to 4 by removing system-level goals that the contract doesn't enforce:\n  - Removed iSCP-001 (\"pause within 30 minutes\") - this is a system goal, not a contract-enforced property\n  - Removed iDPM-005 (\"Foundation Safe can change Deputy\") - already covered in setDeputy function spec\n  - Kept only non-obvious security properties the contract must maintain\n- **Added missing function specifications** for guardianSafe() and usedNonces mapping\n- **Improved function specs** with clearer MUST/MUST NOT requirements in single behavior list (no subsections)\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n**⚠️ Risk Level: MEDIUM** - This is a substantial documentation refactor that removes significant content. Manual verification required.\n\n- [ ] **CRITICAL: Check if old spec should be deleted** - The original spec at `specs/protocol/deputy-pause-module.md` still exists. Decide if it should be deleted, updated to redirect, or if both specs should coexist for some reason. Having two specs for the same contract could cause confusion.\n\n- [ ] **Verify removed assumptions were truly non-essential** - I removed 5 assumptions based on guidelines (governance process details, trivial \"contracts work correctly\" statements). Confirm these weren't critical for understanding the security model.\n\n- [ ] **Verify removed invariants were truly non-enforced properties** - I removed iSCP-001 (30-minute activation time) as a \"system goal\" rather than contract-enforced property, and iDPM-005 (Foundation can change Deputy) as redundant with setDeputy spec. Confirm this reasoning is sound.\n\n- [ ] **Spot-check function specs against contract** - Compare a few function specifications (especially `pause` and `setDeputy`) against the actual contract at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/safe/DeputyPauseModule.sol` to verify accuracy.\n\n### Test Plan\n\nSince this is documentation:\n1. Review the contract code at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/safe/DeputyPauseModule.sol` alongside the new spec\n2. Verify each function specification matches the actual implementation\n3. Confirm invariants capture the non-obvious security properties\n4. Ensure no critical security properties were lost in the restructuring\n\n### Notes\n\n- All linting checks pass (markdown format, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- Followed canonical format: Overview → Definitions → Assumptions → Invariants → Function Specification\n- Excluded `version()` function per guidelines (standard ISemver)\n- Used definition references ([Deputy](#deputy)) throughout for DRY principle\n\n**Session Info:**\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) (@aliersh)\n- Session URL: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/0672f348947b40478751f459427d858f",

      "body": "# docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create LivenessModule specification\n\n## Summary\n\nCreated a comprehensive specification for the `LivenessModule` contract following the canonical OP Stack specification format. The LivenessModule enables permissionless removal of inactive Safe owners based on liveness data from the LivenessGuard, with a shutdown mechanism that transfers ownership to a fallback owner when the owner count falls too low.\n\n**Key sections:**\n- **Definitions**: 5 core concepts (Liveness Interval, Minimum Owners, Threshold Percentage, Fallback Owner, Shutdown)\n- **Assumptions**: 2 external dependencies (LivenessGuard accuracy, fallback owner trusted)\n- **Invariants**: 4 high-level security properties (threshold maintenance, live owner protection, non-live owner removal, shutdown triggering)\n- **Function Specification**: All 10 public/external functions documented (constructor + 9 functions; version() excluded per guidelines)\n\n**Changes from initial draft:**\n- Simplified assumption a02-002 from \"governance-controlled\" to \"trusted\" per feedback\n- Refocused invariants on higher-level properties rather than implementation details per feedback\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **CRITICAL: Verify spec matches contract implementation** - Cross-reference the spec against `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/safe/LivenessModule.sol`, especially:\n  - The `removeOwners` function behavior and its shutdown transition logic\n  - The `_verifyFinalState` checks and what they enforce\n  - The threshold calculation formula in `getRequiredThreshold`\n- [ ] **Validate invariants are truly cross-function** - Ensure the 4 invariants span multiple functions and aren't just documenting single-function access control or parameter validation (per strict spec guidelines)\n- [ ] **Check shutdown mechanism accuracy** - The spec describes how the module transitions from normal removal mode to shutdown mode when owner count drops below MIN_OWNERS. Verify this matches `_removeOwner`, `_swapToFallbackOwnerSafeCall`, and the for-loop logic in `removeOwners`\n- [ ] **Verify assumptions are actual dependencies** - Confirm the 2 assumptions (LivenessGuard accuracy, fallback owner trust) are truly external dependencies required for the contract to function correctly\n\n### Notes\n\nThis specification was created from scratch (no existing LivenessModule spec existed in the specs repo, only a high-level description in `safe-extensions.md`). The spec is placed in `/specs/experimental/contracts/safe/` to match the contract location and follows the kebab-case naming convention.\n\nAll linting checks pass (markdown format, TOC, spelling, filenames).

DelayedWETH is a WETH extension that enforces time-delayed withdrawals and provides emergency recovery mechanisms for the Fault Dispute Game bond system.\n\n**Key components:**\n- **Overview**: High-level description of DelayedWETH's role in holding dispute game bonds\n- **Definitions**: Withdrawal Delay, Sub-Account, and Withdrawal Request concepts\n- **Assumptions**: Owner governance constraints and SuperchainConfig pause state dependency\n- **Invariants**: Withdrawal delay enforcement and owner emergency intervention capability\n- **Function Specification**: Complete documentation of all public/external functions (except `version()`)\n\nAlso added `reinitializer` to `words.txt` for spell checking and alphabetically sorted the file.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\nThis is a documentation-only change with moderate risk of misalignment between spec and implementation. Please verify:\n\n- [ ] **Function specifications accurately match contract implementation** - Compare each function's documented behavior against the actual DelayedWETH.sol contract code, especially the `unlock()`, `withdraw()`, `recover()`, and `hold()` functions\n- [ ] **Invariants capture the critical security properties** - Review whether the two invariants (delay enforcement and owner intervention) correctly represent the contract's most important non-obvious security guarantees\n- [ ] **Assumptions are complete** - Verify that external dependencies on Owner behavior and SuperchainConfig are accurately captured and no other critical assumptions are missing\n- [ ] **Severity ratings are appropriate** - Confirm that \"High\" severity for both invariants is correct given they depend on assumption failures\n- [ ] **Definitions are clear and useful** - Check that Sub-Account, Withdrawal Delay, and Withdrawal Request definitions will help readers understand the spec\n\n### Test Plan\nSince this is documentation, test by:\n1. Reading the spec alongside the contract implementation in `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DelayedWETH.sol`\n2. Verifying all documented behaviors match the actual code\n3. Checking that someone unfamiliar with the contract could implement it from this spec alone\n\n### Notes\n- This specification follows the canonical format without a \"Dependencies\" section (deprecated)\n- Excluded `version()` function per specification guidelines\n- No existing DelayedWETH spec was found in the repository\n- Related documentation exists in `specs/fault-proof/stage-one/bond-incentives.md` which describes how DelayedWETH integrates with the Fault Dispute Game\n\n---\n\n**Link to Devin run**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/e9dd7451d51d47e2822b784154686502  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) (@aliersh)",

Consider if any critical invariants are missing.\n\n- [ ] **Validate function specifications against contract**: Review each function spec against the actual ProxyAdmin.sol implementation to ensure behaviors are accurately documented, especially the type-specific routing logic in `upgrade`, `changeProxyAdmin`, and `upgradeAndCall`.\n\n- [ ] **Confirm \"no assumptions\" is correct**: Verify that the contract truly has no required external assumptions, or if dependencies on proxy behavior/AddressManager should be documented.\n\n- [ ] **Test against real usage**: If possible, validate the spec against actual ProxyAdmin deployments to ensure it captures real-world usage patterns and constraints for managing legacy proxies.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This contract is primarily used for managing legacy proxy types during migrations, so the legacy proxy definitions (ChugSplash, ResolvedDelegate) may benefit from additional historical context if deemed necessary.\n- All linting checks pass (markdown, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- Session: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/c384f950bf60481abf588db1bbdf2862\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",
