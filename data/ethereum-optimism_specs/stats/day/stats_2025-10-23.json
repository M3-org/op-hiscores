      "body": "# docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create SaferSafes specification\n\n## Summary\nThis PR adds a new canonical specification for SaferSafes at:\n- specs/experimental/contracts/safe/safer-safes.md\n\nThe spec follows the required structure (Overview → Definitions → Assumptions → Invariants → Function Specification) and documents the combined behavior of the LivenessModule2 and TimelockGuard when used together on a Safe (v1.4.1).\n\nHighlights:\n- Overview of the contract’s role: combined liveness challenge module and timelock guard for Safe.\n- Precise Definitions for contract-specific concepts (e.g., Liveness Response Period, Timelock Delay, Cancellation Threshold, Maximum Cancellation Threshold, Blocking Threshold, Scheduled/Pending Transactions).\n- Assumptions focused on external dependencies (notably Safe version compatibility).\n- Non-obvious cross-cutting Invariants, including the combined-config constraint that the liveness response period must be at least twice the timelock delay when both are enabled/configured, ownership transfer atomicity, guard removal upon takeover, scheduling uniqueness, and cancellation threshold bounds/reset.\n- Function Specifications covering all public/external functions of LivenessModule2 and TimelockGuard, using MUST/MUST NOT language. The standard version() function is intentionally omitted per repository guidance.\n\nLocal lint passes:\n- markdownlint, doctoc, cspell, and filename checks all pass locally.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n2–3 items (low-risk docs-only change)\n- [ ] Validate that Assumptions comply with the repo policy. Specifically assess whether a02-001 (Fallback Owner Honesty) and a03-001 (Owner Key Security) are truly required external dependencies or better categorized as context, and if needed, request removal or reclassification.\n- [ ] Confirm that each Invariant is non-obvious and cross-cutting. Pay special attention to:\n  - i01-001 (response period ≥ 2 × timelock delay) correctly scoped to “both enabled and configured,” matching SaferSafes._checkCombinedConfig early-return behavior.\n  - i07-001 (cancellation threshold bounds) reflects intended requirement versus implementation details (increase only if below max).\n- [ ] Decide whether to add this page to specs/SUMMARY.md so it shows in the mdbook navigation (lint doesn’t enforce this; current PR does not update SUMMARY).\n\nRecommended test plan:\n- Run just lint-specs-md-check, just lint-specs-toc-check, just lint-specs-spelling-check to match CI environment.\n- Run mdbook build to ensure the book compiles without errors and verify the page renders if added to SUMMARY.md.\n\n### Notes\n- The spec excludes version() from Function Specification per repo guidance.\n- No “Dependencies” section is included (deprecated).\n- Session: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/f3b501a2e19b4ccdbdf0145a9c5c1388\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co), GitHub: @aliersh",

      "body": "# docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create DelayedWETH specification\n\n## Summary\n\nCreated a comprehensive specification for the DelayedWETH contract following the OP Stack canonical specification format. DelayedWETH is a WETH extension that enforces time-delayed withdrawals and provides emergency recovery mechanisms for the Fault Dispute Game bond system.\n\n**Key components:**\n- **Overview**: High-level description of DelayedWETH's role in holding dispute game bonds\n- **Definitions**: Withdrawal Delay, Sub-Account, and Withdrawal Request concepts\n- **Assumptions**: Owner governance constraints and SuperchainConfig pause state dependency\n- **Invariants**: Withdrawal delay enforcement and owner emergency intervention capability\n- **Function Specification**: Complete documentation of all public/external functions (except `version()`)\n\nAlso added `reinitializer` to `words.txt` for spell checking and alphabetically sorted the file.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\nThis is a documentation-only change with moderate risk of misalignment between spec and implementation. Please verify:\n\n- [ ] **Function specifications accurately match contract implementation** - Compare each function's documented behavior against the actual DelayedWETH.sol contract code, especially the `unlock()`, `withdraw()`, `recover()`, and `hold()` functions\n- [ ] **Invariants capture the critical security properties** - Review whether the two invariants (delay enforcement and owner intervention) correctly represent the contract's most important non-obvious security guarantees\n- [ ] **Assumptions are complete** - Verify that external dependencies on Owner behavior and SuperchainConfig are accurately captured and no other critical assumptions are missing\n- [ ] **Severity ratings are appropriate** - Confirm that \"High\" severity for both invariants is correct given they depend on assumption failures\n- [ ] **Definitions are clear and useful** - Check that Sub-Account, Withdrawal Delay, and Withdrawal Request definitions will help readers understand the spec\n\n### Test Plan\nSince this is documentation, test by:\n1. Reading the spec alongside the contract implementation in `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DelayedWETH.sol`\n2. Verifying all documented behaviors match the actual code\n3. Checking that someone unfamiliar with the contract could implement it from this spec alone\n\n### Notes\n- This specification follows the canonical format without a \"Dependencies\" section (deprecated)\n- Excluded `version()` function per specification guidelines\n- No existing DelayedWETH spec was found in the repository\n- Related documentation exists in `specs/fault-proof/stage-one/bond-incentives.md` which describes how DelayedWETH integrates with the Fault Dispute Game\n\n---\n\n**Link to Devin run**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/e9dd7451d51d47e2822b784154686502  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) (@aliersh)",

The LivenessGuard is a Safe contract extension that tracks owner liveness by recording timestamps when owners sign transactions or explicitly demonstrate activity.\n\n**Changes:**\n- Created `specs/experimental/contracts/safe/liveness-guard.md` with complete specification\n- Added new \"Contract Specifications > Safe\" section to SUMMARY.md\n- Added \"misattributed\" and \"desynchronized\" to words.txt for spell checking\n\nThe specification includes:\n- **Overview**: High-level description of the contract's monitoring role\n- **Definitions**: Contract-specific terms (Liveness Timestamp, Owners Before Set)\n- **Assumptions**: Single assumption about Safe contract integrity\n- **Invariants**: Three non-obvious security properties (signature attribution, non-reversion guarantee, owner set synchronization)\n- **Function Specification**: Complete coverage of all public/external functions except `version()`\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify specification accuracy against actual contract**: Compare the function behaviors, invariants, and assumptions in the spec against the LivenessGuard.sol contract at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/safe/LivenessGuard.sol` to ensure they accurately reflect the intended behavior\n- [ ] **Review invariant severity ratings**: Confirm that i02-002 (Non-Reversion Guarantee) is appropriately marked as Critical, and i01-001 and i03-003 are appropriately marked as High\n- [ ] **Check directory structure**: Verify that placing this spec in `experimental/contracts/safe/` aligns with repository conventions for contract specifications\n- [ ] **Validate completeness**: Ensure the spec covers all critical edge cases mentioned in the contract comments, particularly the non-reversion requirement and owner set synchronization logic\n\n### Test Plan\n1. Run `just lint` to verify all linting checks pass (markdown, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n2. Build the mdbook locally with `just serve` to ensure the new spec renders correctly and navigation works\n3. Verify the specification is accessible from the table of contents\n\n### Notes\n\nThis specification complements the existing high-level documentation in `specs/protocol/safe-extensions.md` by providing implementation-level detail following the canonical specification format.\n\n**Link to Devin run**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/a768841d20984906bcfa2cce7f77ecd4  \n**Requested by**: Ariel Diaz (@aliersh) from ariel@oplabs.co",

      "body": "# docs(specs/experimental/contracts): create StorageSetter specification\n\n## Summary\n\nCreated a comprehensive specification for the StorageSetter contract, a low-level utility contract that provides arbitrary storage slot manipulation during contract upgrades and migrations. The spec documents all 9 public/external functions (excluding the standard `version()` function per guidelines) covering setters and getters for bytes32, uint256, address, and bool types, plus a batch operation for multiple bytes32 values.\n\n**Key decisions:**\n- **Zero invariants**: This simple utility contract has no access control, no complex state management, and no security properties to enforce beyond what Solidity provides\n- **Zero assumptions**: The contract has no external dependencies or required behaviors from other systems\n- No definitions needed - the operations are straightforward storage manipulation\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify zero invariants/assumptions is appropriate** - The contract is intentionally unrestricted and serves as a low-level tool. Confirm this justifies having no invariants or assumptions documented.\n- [ ] **Security warning omission** - The contract source includes `WARNING: this contract is not safe to be called by untrusted parties`. I didn't include this in the spec as it's usage context rather than a technical property. Confirm this is the right call.\n- [ ] **Function specification accuracy** - Compare each function spec against the actual contract implementation to ensure all behaviors are correctly documented (especially the zero-value return cases for getters).\n\n### Test Plan\nSince this is documentation, the \"test\" is whether someone could implement the contract correctly from the spec alone. Review each function specification and verify it provides sufficient detail about expected behavior.\n\n### Notes\n- All linting checks pass (markdown, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- File placed at correct location per guidelines: `experimental/contracts/universal/storage-setter.md`\n- Followed canonical format: Overview → Definitions → Assumptions → Invariants → Function Specification\n- Session: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/4ac8fd902969420284c28fedf12fbcf0\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",

The spec documents:\n\n- **Key generation functions**: `localizeIdent`, `localize`, and `keccak256PreimageKey`\n- **Key types**: Local keys (type 1, caller-scoped) and global keys (type 2, universally accessible)\n- **Localization operation**: The cryptographic transformation that ensures caller isolation for local keys\n- **Security invariants**: Uniqueness of localized keys per caller and preservation of key type bytes\n\nThe specification follows the canonical OP Stack contract specification format with sections for Overview, Definitions, Assumptions, Invariants, and Function Specification.\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify technical accuracy**: Compare the documented behaviors (especially the localization formula and key type values) against the actual `PreimageKeyLib.sol` contract implementation\n- [ ] **Check consistency with fault proof specs**: Ensure terminology and descriptions align with how preimage keys are described in related specs (e.g., `fault-proof/cannon-fault-proof-vm.md`, `fault-proof/stage-one/fault-dispute-game.md`)\n- [ ] **Validate invariants and severity ratings**: Confirm that the two invariants capture the most critical security properties and that \"Critical\" and \"High\" severity ratings are appropriate for the actual impact\n- [ ] **Review definitions**: Ensure the defined terms (Preimage Key, Key Type, Local Key, Global Key, Localization) are clear and don't conflict with definitions in other specs\n\n### Test Plan\n\n1. Read through the specification alongside the source code at `packages/contracts-bedrock/src/cannon/PreimageKeyLib.sol`\n2. Verify each function specification matches the actual implementation\n3. Check that the localization formula `H(k || sender || local_context) & ~(0xFF << 248) | (0x01 << 248)` accurately describes the `localize` function\n4. Confirm key type bytes: type 1 for local keys, type 2 for global keccak256 keys\n\n### Notes\n\n- This is a documentation-only PR with no code changes\n- All linting checks pass (markdown, TOC, spelling, filenames)\n- The spec is placed in `specs/experimental/contracts/cannon/` following the path convention (strips `src/` prefix from contract location)\n- Session: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/2df7643a5fc7429aa2b82f32f59e3d1e\n- Requested by: Ariel Diaz (ariel@oplabs.co) / @aliersh",
