      "number": 655,
      "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nSpike of calldata footprint block limit implementation.\r\n\r\nFollowing the idea of [multidimenstional gas metering](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-practical-proposal-for-multidimensional-gas-metering/22668) (but without changing regular gas accounting), a new _calldata footprint_ resource is introduced. The calldata footprint is of the same scale as transaction gas. The total calldata footprint of a block is limited by the same gas limit as for regular gas. This has the effect that total calldata usage of a block is constrained, with the right parameters, more than by calldata (floor) gas usage. The _calldata footprint cost_ is comparable to the regular _calldata floor cost_, but higher values would be chosen.\r\n\r\nUsing the FastLZ-based estimated size of a transaction from Fjord, a transaction's calldata footprint is now simply `calldataFootprint = estimatedSize * calldataFootprintCost`. So it estimates the transaction's calldata impact on the DA batch it will be a part of, scaled to be comparable to gas, so it can be limited by the same block limit.\r\n\r\nA block's _gas used_ field is now set to the maximum of the two resources, the total gas used of all transaction (as before), and the total calldata footprint of all transactions. This has the benefit that the EIP-1559 fee market now also takes total calldata footprint into account and the base fee reacts to calldata-heavy blocks.\r\n\r\nAn open question is whether we want to make the _calldata footprint cost_ a protocol constant, or configurable per chain via the `SystemConfig` L1 contract.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease describe any tests you've added. If you've added no tests, or left important behavior untested, please explain why not.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem you're solving.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nInclude a link to any github issues that this may close in the following form:\r\n- Fixes #[Link to Issue]\r\n-->\r\n",
