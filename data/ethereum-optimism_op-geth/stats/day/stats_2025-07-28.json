      "author": "wlawt",
      "number": 648,
      "body": "<!--\r\nContributions welcome! See https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFrom: https://github.com/wlawt/op-geth/pull/20 \r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nA clear and concise description of the features you're adding in this pull request.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a [configurable minimum base fee](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/blob/main/protocol/minimum-base-fee.md) to op-geth. Specifically, this extends the `extraData` section in the block header to include an extra u64 for this addition. The default value would be zero, as if there was no minimum base fee to begin with if the configurable minimum base fee wasn't enabled. \r\n\r\nThis PR also adopts the new feature flag oriented approach in terms of the naming conventions. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease describe any tests you've added. If you've added no tests, or left important behavior untested, please explain why not.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Extended tests to include Jovian and the new minBaseFee fee\r\n- Added tests to ensure CalcBaseFee is still correct\r\n- Added activation test\r\n- Went through the repo for mentions of Holocene or EIP1559Params to check for more tests to add, but didn't find any that I think would be impacted\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAdd any other context about the problem you're solving.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIntroducing a minimum base fee reduces the chances of experiencing priority fee auctions which occur when the block is almost at the gas limit, as well as cases where batcher sequencer throttling is happening where it intentionally processes fewer transactions to avoid a backlog of batches.\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nInclude a link to any github issues that this may close in the following form:\r\n- Fixes #[Link to Issue]\r\n-->\r\n\r\nN/A",
