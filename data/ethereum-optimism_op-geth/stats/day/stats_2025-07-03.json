However due to the way L2 blocks are constructed (with L1 attributes), we have to load all transactions to be able to derive all the necessary information.\r\n* https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31427 introduces always removing empty accounts from pre state, in the spirit of minimal diff with upstrea, I elected to change the optimism.json file to match the latest output (with no pre-states for empty acount)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
