# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September began with a significant integration effort, bringing `op-geth` up to date by merging the latest upstream `go-ethereum v1.16.2`. Following this merge, development focus shifted to extensive planning and discussion around the upcoming Kona and Cannon upgrades, with detailed conversations on necessary changes to OPCM, `op-dispute-mon`, and prestate configurations. Concurrently, the team triaged new reports of node instability and RPC inconsistencies, while also advancing discussions on improving CI/CD infrastructure and test coverage. The period was characterized by foundational integration work followed by strategic planning for future feature support and system reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary code contribution this month was a major upstream synchronization to maintain alignment with the core Ethereum client.

- **Upstream Geth Integration:** The `op-geth` codebase was updated by merging `go-ethereum v1.16.2` ([#663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/663)). This crucial update incorporates numerous changes from the upstream Geth repository, ensuring `op-geth` benefits from the latest developments, bug fixes, and features in components like `cmd/geth`, `accounts/abi`, and `cmd/devp2p`.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed in this period, but several critical new issues were opened and existing discussions progressed, highlighting key areas of focus for the coming weeks.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in the first part of September.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Kona & Cannon Upgrade Preparation:** A significant portion of discussion centered on preparing for the Kona and Cannon upgrades. Active issues detailed the necessary changes for OPCM to support the new game type ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17285)), updates required for `op-dispute-mon` to correctly handle the new game types ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17286)), and the definition of a `standard-prestates.toml` format to include `cannon-kona` prestates ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17283)).
    - **Node Stability and RPC Bugs:** Two important new issues were reported. One detailed a `leveldb panic` when initializing a node with a large genesis file, pointing to potential stability problems ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/668)). The other reported missing events in `eth_getLogs` calls and high latency, suggesting issues with RPC reliability and event indexing ([#667](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/667)).
    - **CI/CD and Testing Enhancements:** Discussions continued on improving the developer experience for local CI job execution ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17184)). Additionally, the issue for sync testing was reopened to ensure more comprehensive testing across hard fork transitions ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16703)).
    - **Configuration and Compatibility:** A bug in the P2P gossip configuration that overwrites defaults with zero values, causing test panics, was actively debated ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17308)). Concerns also remained regarding Cannon's compatibility with Go 1.25, as the required MIPS fix was not included in the latest Go patch release ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17060)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident through in-depth technical discussions across numerous issues. Contributors like `ajsutton`, `pauldowman`, `wood-jp`, `bitwiseguy`, `teddyknox`, and `pcw109550` were actively engaged in problem-solving and planning. The detailed debate in issue [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17308) regarding the best approach to fix an invalid P2P configuration highlights the team's focus on robust, long-term solutions over simple patches. The reopening of issue [#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16703) to improve test coverage further demonstrates a collective commitment to quality and thoroughness.
