# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
August was a month of significant foundational work and strategic planning for `op-geth`. The most impactful achievement was the successful merge of `go-ethereum v1.16.1`, aligning the project with the latest upstream developments and ensuring long-term stability. Progress continued on the Flashblocks integration, with enablement confirmed on Sunnyside sequencers and ongoing work on load testing and alerting. Key protocol enhancements were initiated, including a new feature for a minimum base fee, while important architectural discussions began around replacing the `op-node` p2p sync mechanism. The month also saw strong community engagement, particularly around the migration to a new "Forge Deployer" tooling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on upstream integration and critical protocol fixes and features.

-   **Upstream Geth Integration:** A major effort was completed to merge `go-ethereum v1.16.1` into the `op-geth` codebase ([#652](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/652)). This extensive update, touching numerous directories, brings `op-geth` up to date with the latest Geth version, incorporating crucial upstream improvements and ensuring future compatibility.

-   **Protocol Enhancements & Fixes:**
    -   A critical bug fix was implemented in the engine API to correct errors and improve checks related to execution payload creation in `beacon/engine` and `eth/catalyst` ([#662](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/662)).
    -   Work began on a new feature to introduce a minimum base fee, with a pull request opened for its implementation ([#666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/666)).
    -   A pull request was opened to address a spike related to calldata footprint block limits, aiming to improve network stability ([#655](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/655)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in August focused on finalizing specifications, making strategic decisions on tooling, and investigating new bugs and architectural improvements.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Flashblocks Progress:** An issue was closed confirming that all Sunnyside sequencers for Sepolia are now running with Flashblocks enabled ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16688)). In a strategic shift, support for Flashblocks in Kurtosis was deprioritized and the corresponding issue was closed ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16514)).
    -   **Specification Finalization:** The specification for the minimum base fee was ratified and the tracking issue was closed ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/742)), paving the way for its implementation.
    -   **Tooling & Cleanup:** A decision was made not to pursue challenger support within `op-up`, closing the related issue to focus on other backend solutions ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17005)). Several other operational and tracking issues were also closed, improving project hygiene ([#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/13543), [#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17007), [#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17151)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Sync Mechanism Architecture:** A significant discussion continued around deprecating the req-resp p2p sync in `op-node` ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/14108)). A detailed alternative for unsafe block sync was proposed, suggesting a simpler and faster mechanism that could improve node recovery and scale-out.
    -   **CI/CD & Developer Experience:** A new issue was opened to explore running the monorepo CI suite on `op-geth` pull requests to prevent regressions ([#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/665)). Active discussions also took place around improving `op-deployer` documentation ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1530)).
    -   **Investigation & Debugging:** A new issue was opened to investigate gas cost discrepancies observed when using `debug_traceCall` ([#664](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/664)). Community interest remains in resolving an issue where some RPC responses are missing content types ([#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/389)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
August highlighted strong collaboration both within the core team and with the broader community.

-   The migration to a "Forge Deployer" saw significant community interest, with contributor `tooshiNoko` proactively offering to take on multiple related tasks and coordinating with the team to avoid duplicate work ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17213), [#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17214), [#17215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17215)).
-   The discussion on replacing the p2p sync mechanism ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/14108)) was enriched by detailed technical context and an alternative proposal from `@emilianobonassi`, demonstrating deep engagement from subject matter experts.
-   The team showed responsiveness to community feedback by quickly addressing and resolving an issue where a project was inappropriately flagged in a Retro-Funding process ([#72](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/72)).
