# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of significant refinement and preparation for `op-geth`. Development focused on enhancing the robustness of interop transaction handling, with key optimizations to the block building path and the introduction of supervisor failsafe detection. The transaction pool received critical updates to improve validation and ensure correct filtering of re-injected transactions after reorgs. A major effort was also made to clean up the issue backlog, closing numerous long-standing items related to sequencer stability and testing. Towards the end of the month, development shifted to laying the groundwork for a major new feature: configurable base fees and data gas.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving stability, performance, and compatibility within the Superchain ecosystem.

-   **Interop & Transaction Handling:**
    -   The block building path was optimized by removing the `checkInterop` function, which was found to consume excessive time during block construction ([#585](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/585)).
    -   To improve security, the system was enhanced to detect supervisor failsafe states and reject interop transactions if the failsafe is active ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/636)).

-   **Transaction Pool Enhancements:**
    -   A new `MaxTxGasLimit` feature was introduced to the transaction pool, allowing sequencers to enforce a per-transaction gas limit ([#626](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/626)).
    -   The transaction pool was refactored to ensure that transactions re-injected into the mempool after a reorg are correctly re-evaluated by ingress filters ([#642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/642)).

-   **Superchain Compatibility & Tracing:**
    -   Tracing capabilities were improved to display the `OptimismBaseFeeRecipient` in prestate results, providing better debugging information for Optimism-specific transactions ([#407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/407)).
    -   The Superchain Registry commit was updated to align `op-geth` with the latest configurations ([#640](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/640)).
    -   To ensure broader compatibility, `op-geth` was updated to skip Celo Mainnet's non-standard genesis processing ([#646](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/646)).

-   **Preparatory & Upstream Work:**
    -   Work began on merging `go-ethereum` v1.16.1 to keep `op-geth` synchronized with upstream improvements ([#638](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/638)).
    -   Groundwork was laid for future economic features with new pull requests to introduce a configurable minimum base fee ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/648)) and configurable data gas ([#653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/653)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The month saw a concerted effort to address both new and long-standing issues, significantly improving the project's health.

-   **Closed Issues:** A large number of issues were closed, reflecting progress in stability and maintenance.
    -   **Sequencer Stability:** Several long-standing issues concerning sequencer halting ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/12240)) and recovery from sequence window expiration ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/11228)) were closed as no longer relevant.
    -   **Performance & Bugs:** A long-standing issue regarding slow block retrieval was resolved ([#555](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/555)). An issue where re-injected transactions could bypass filters was identified and promptly fixed ([#641](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/641)).
    -   **Configuration & Testing:** Issues related to flashblocks deployment strategy ([#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16689), [#16690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16690)) and interop prestate configuration ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15765)) were resolved, clarifying project direction.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Configurable Fees:** The most significant new work is centered around the "Min Base Fee" feature, with new issues opened to track its implementation in the block header ([#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/649)) and payload attributes ([#650](https://github.ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/650)).
    -   **Potential Blockers:** An investigation into abnormal CPU usage reported by users ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/613)) remains active. Additionally, a flaky CI test where an invalid interop transaction is conditionally included in the mempool ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/635)) is proving difficult to reproduce and resolve.
    -   **Future Work:** Active discussions on designing a `sync-tester` service for mock EL testing ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16452)) and stress-testing the interop expiry window ([#15285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15285)) highlight upcoming development priorities.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was strong this month, with detailed discussions driving design decisions and issue resolution. The active dialogue around the `Min Base Fee` feature ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16807)) demonstrated cross-repository coordination with work happening in `op-alloy` and `reth`. The resolution of issues like the interop prestate configuration ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15765)) showcased thoughtful debate on where responsibilities should lie within the stack. Finally, community engagement was evident as a new contributor expressed interest in taking on a task to add a spelling linter ([#680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/680)), a positive sign for the project's contributor ecosystem.
