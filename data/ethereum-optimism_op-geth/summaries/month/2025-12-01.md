# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December was a month of dual focus, marked by significant progress in finalizing the Jovian hard fork while simultaneously addressing critical network stability issues. Development efforts centered on locking in the Jovian feature set by removing feature toggles and enhancing precompile testing. However, this progress was paralleled by the emergence of a widespread node synchronization failure affecting multiple Superchain networks, including Optimism and Base. This issue, characterized by "missing trie node" errors, became a top priority, shifting focus to diagnostics and community-supported triage to ensure the health of the ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month concentrated on preparing for and hardening the Jovian hard fork, alongside other protocol enhancements.

- **Jovian Hard Fork Finalization:** The scope for the Jovian hard fork was officially locked as feature toggles were removed from the codebase, streamlining the client by making the new features permanent ([#703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/703)). To support this, new tests and comments were added to validate the updated precompile input size limits, ensuring the robustness of these protocol changes ([#731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/731)). A follow-up fix for an `eth_simulateV1` issue post-Jovian was also proposed ([#732](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/732)).

- **Ongoing Protocol Updates:** Work on protocol enhancements continued with new pull requests for unspecified initialization logic ([#733](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/733)) and other protocol updates ([#730](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/730)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month involved resolving documentation and isolated sync problems, while a more severe, widespread synchronization issue emerged as a major focus.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Node Synchronization & Bugs:** An issue where an EL node failed to sync after an `op-node` update was resolved by upgrading and resyncing `op-geth` ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18510)).
    - **Documentation:** Several documentation gaps were addressed, including updates to the JSON-RPC API docs ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1773)), making environment variables available ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1874)), and fixing a theme-switcher UI bug on the docs site ([#1752](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1752)).
    - **Protocol Strategy:** A key decision was made to use `op-challenger` for ZK game challenging, closing the related spike issue ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18322)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Critical Sync Failures:** The most significant active issue is [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581), which details widespread node synchronization failures across Base, Optimism, and Unichain. Users reported "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors, particularly when using certain public snapshots. Maintainers are actively requesting detailed logs and configuration from affected users to diagnose the root cause.
    - **Superchain Configuration:** Discussion continued on porting the `SuperchainConfig` type from `superchain-registry` into `op-geth`, with feedback being incorporated into a forthcoming pull request ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/741)).
    - **Code Refactoring:** A discussion is ongoing about removing the `isPectra` flag from the batcher, with a contributor expressing interest in taking on the task ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18479)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly visible this month, particularly in response to the critical synchronization issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581)). Maintainers like @rdin777 engaged directly with multiple community members to gather diagnostic information, demonstrating a rapid and collaborative triage process. Elsewhere, maintainer `geoknee` was active across several issues, providing guidance on topics ranging from node synchronization ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18510)) to the potential implementation of an `op-spammer` component ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18482)). The development process also showed iterative feedback loops, as seen in the `SuperchainConfig` discussion ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/741)) where @Himess incorporated suggestions from @emhane.
