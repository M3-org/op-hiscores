# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Development in early December focused on foundational protocol work and strategic planning. While no major features were merged, significant progress was made through active discussions and new pull requests. Key activities included advancing protocol updates, enhancing Jovian precompiles, and making a strategic decision to use `op-challenger` for ZK game challenging. The team also engaged in critical discussions regarding `op-node` synchronization issues, Superchain configuration, and the potential development of new developer tooling.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
While no pull requests were merged during this period, new work was initiated on core protocol components.

- **Protocol and Precompile Enhancements:**
  - Work on protocol updates continued with the introduction of a new pull request ([#730](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/730)).
  - To improve the robustness of Jovian precompiles, another pull request ([#731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/731)) was opened to add necessary tests and comments for new input size limits.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this period was characterized by key decision-making and active discussion on core infrastructure challenges. No new issues were opened.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - A significant strategic decision was made in [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18322), which concluded that the `op-challenger` will be used to support challenging ZK games.
  - A minor documentation UI issue regarding text visibility in the theme-switcher ([#1752](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1752)) was closed, with a fix anticipated as part of a larger framework switch.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - A critical user-facing issue ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18510)) regarding `op-node` synchronization failures for multiple chains is under active investigation, with maintainers requesting more detailed logs from affected users.
  - Discussion continued on porting the `SuperchainConfig` type from `superchain-registry` ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/741)), leading to a new PR that incorporates community feedback on specification syntax.
  - Proposals for new developer tooling, such as an `op-spammer` component ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18482)), and enhancements to existing tools like `sysgo` ([#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16450)) are also under review.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active issue discussions. For instance, the conversation around the `SuperchainConfig` type in issue [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/741) showed a healthy feedback loop, where contributor @Himess incorporated suggestions from @emhane before opening a pull request. Maintainers like `geoknee` were actively engaged in triaging user-reported problems and providing guidance on technical proposals, fostering a responsive and collaborative development environment.
