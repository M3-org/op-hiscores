# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of targeted enhancements and critical fixes for `op-geth`. Development focused on advancing the Data Availability (DA) footprint feature, which introduces new gas metering concepts to the protocol. Significant effort was also dedicated to improving infrastructure stability, with multiple issues related to Flashblocks and Sepolia sequencer operations being resolved. The team continued to integrate changes from upstream Geth to maintain security and feature parity, while also addressing important bugs in consensus logic and fee calculation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on protocol upgrades, bug fixes, and maintaining alignment with upstream Geth.

- **Data Availability & Gas Metering Enhancements**
  - Foundational work was completed to implement a calldata footprint block limit spike, exploring multidimensional gas metering without altering the EVM ([#655]).
  - To support broader monorepo updates, the data availability footprint gas scalar was made configurable, providing more flexibility in managing transaction costs ([#675]).

- **Consensus and Fee Calculation Fixes**
  - A critical bug was fixed where OP Legacy header verification was not being correctly dispatched, ensuring proper consensus on legacy blocks ([#697]).
  - The operator fee calculation was corrected to address an issue from a previous rewrite, ensuring fees are handled accurately ([#696]).

- **Upstream Geth Integration**
  - To bolster Fusaka defense on Sepolia, critical PRs were cherry-picked from upstream Geth to resolve a configuration bug related to `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` ([#690]).
  - The `op-geth` version was bumped to `v1.101603.1` to stay current with the latest changes from the base Geth client ([#695]).

- **Performance and Benchmarking**
  - New pull requests were opened to introduce benchmarks for `benchmarkComputeCellProofs` ([#692]) and to explore using a read lock for certain methods to improve performance ([#698]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on stabilizing core infrastructure and maturing the new DA footprint feature.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks Stability:** A series of issues were resolved to improve the Flashblocks system. This included refining alerts and runbooks ([#17423]), fixing a websocket-proxy bug that caused lost flashblocks ([#17856]), and completing coordination with RPC providers for a new node ([#17857]).
  - **Data Availability Footprint Maturation:** Key issues supporting the DA footprint feature were closed, including updating specifications to use the `blobBaseFee` header field ([#792]), and completing both acceptance tests ([#17278]) and unit tests ([#17395]).
  - **Infrastructure & Configuration:** A bug causing `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` to use default configurations was fixed ([#685]), and an issue related to demoting a Sepolia sequencer was closed ([#17683]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Dispute System Refinement:** The dispute mechanism remains an active area of development. Discussion continued on fixing how `op-dispute-mon` handles out-of-sync nodes ([#17814]). Additionally, an issue to use the v2 dispute game implementation was reopened due to a remaining TODO in the code, indicating that work is ongoing ([#17257]).
  - **Sequencer Stability:** A new critical issue was opened after `op-conductor` failed to start a sequencer with a "no unsafe head" error, highlighting a potential operational vulnerability ([#17899]).
  - **Protocol Mechanics:** An active discussion is underway regarding the necessity of saturating math in the `operatorFee` getter, showing deep analysis of core protocol logic ([#17888]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was characterized by focused technical discussions and constructive guidance for contributors.

- The discussion around replica-healthcheck monitoring ([#17686]) provided a clear example of healthy community interaction. A contributor's PR was kindly redirected after a maintainer clarified that the issue was blocked and intended for the infrastructure team, providing valuable context and guidance for future contributions.
- Active technical debates on issues like the dispute monitor's sync handling ([#17814]) and the operator fee math ([#17888]) demonstrate deep engagement from the core team in ensuring the protocol's correctness and robustness.
- The reopening of the v2 dispute game issue ([#17257]) by a maintainer highlights the team's diligence in tracking work to completion and ensuring no technical debt is left behind.
