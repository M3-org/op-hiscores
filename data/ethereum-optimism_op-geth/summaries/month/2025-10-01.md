# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of targeted enhancements and critical fixes for `op-geth`. Development focused heavily on advancing the Data Availability (DA) footprint limit, with significant progress made from implementation to testing. The team also addressed key stability issues by resolving bugs in consensus logic and rollup cost calculations, and improving the reliability of the Flashblocks service. Continuous integration with upstream Geth remained a priority, ensuring the client stays current and secure. Ongoing discussions around dispute monitoring and sequencer operations highlight the project's focus on long-term network health and decentralization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on implementing new gas metering concepts, fixing critical bugs, and staying in sync with upstream Geth.

- **Data Availability and Gas Metering:** Significant progress was made on multidimensional gas metering. A calldata footprint block limit spike was implemented to explore new gas concepts without altering the EVM ([#655](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/655)). Complementing this, the data availability footprint gas scalar was made configurable to align with broader monorepo updates ([#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/675)).

- **Consensus and Rollup Cost Fixes:** Several important bug fixes were merged. A critical patch to header verification ensures it correctly dispatches to OP legacy pseudo consensus only for OP legacy headers, fixing snap-sync for op-mainnet and op-sepolia ([#697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/697)). A rewrite of the operator fee fix was also implemented to address issues in rollup cost calculation ([#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/696)).

- **Upstream Geth Integration:** The team continued to integrate changes from upstream Geth. Critical PRs were cherry-picked to improve Fusaka defense on Sepolia by fixing a `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` issue ([#690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/690)). The `op-geth` version was also bumped to `v1.101603.1` to incorporate the latest upstream changes ([#695](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/695)).

- **Performance and Benchmarking:** New work was initiated to improve performance and testing capabilities. A pull request was opened to add `benchmarkComputeCellProofs` ([#692](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/692)), and another proposed using a read lock for `Content`, `Pending`, and `ToJournal` methods to improve concurrency ([#698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/698)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on completing the DA footprint feature, stabilizing Flashblocks, and tackling complex challenges in dispute monitoring.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Data Availability Footprint Limit:** A major workstream was completed with the closure of issues for updating the DA footprint block limit specifications ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/792)), adding acceptance tests ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17278)), and implementing unit tests ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17395)).
    - **Flashblocks Stability:** Several issues related to Flashblocks were resolved, including refining alerts and runbooks ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17423)), fixing a connectivity issue that caused lost flashblocks ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17856)), and completing coordination with RPC providers for a new node ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17857)).
    - **Configuration & Infrastructure:** A bug where `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` used default configurations was fixed ([#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/685)), and an adjustment to the Sepolia sequencer configuration was completed ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17683)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Dispute Monitoring:** Significant discussion is ongoing for `op-dispute-mon`'s handling of out-of-sync nodes ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17814)), with debate on the best way to determine a node's sync state. The issue for using the v2 dispute game implementation was also reopened due to a remaining TODO, indicating this is an active area of development ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17257)).
    - **Sequencer Operations:** A new issue was opened regarding an `op-conductor` failure to start the sequencer ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17899)), highlighting a potential operational challenge.
    - **Operator Fee Calculation:** Discussion continues on whether saturating math is necessary in the `operatorFee` getter, with analysis suggesting it may not be needed ([#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17888)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. The conversation around replica-healthcheck monitoring ([#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17686)) provided a clear example of maintainer guidance, where a contributor's PR was kindly redirected after it was clarified that the issue was blocked and intended for the infrastructure team. This interaction helps align community contributions with project priorities. Furthermore, the in-depth problem-solving on the `op-dispute-mon` sync handling issue ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17814)) showcases collaborative efforts to tackle complex protocol components.
