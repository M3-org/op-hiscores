# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month focused on maintenance, stability, and alignment with upstream Geth. The most significant achievement was the integration of an upstream fix to bolster Fusaka defense on Sepolia by resolving a critical configuration bug. Development efforts also included proposals for new benchmarks and keeping the codebase current with a version bump from Geth. While no major new features were shipped, the work undertaken ensures the continued security and reliability of the node software.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on integrating changes from upstream Geth and preparing for future performance analysis.

- **Upstream Integration & Maintenance**
    - A critical bug in Fusaka defense on Sepolia was addressed by cherry-picking upstream Geth PRs. This resolved an issue where `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` was not being correctly applied, ensuring proper node configuration ([#690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/690)).
    - A pull request was opened to bump the `op-geth` version to `v1.101603.1`, continuing the effort to keep the fork in sync with its upstream source ([#695](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/695)).

- **Benchmarking Enhancements**
    - To improve performance measurement capabilities, a new pull request was introduced to add `benchmarkComputeCellProofs` ([#692](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/692)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on resolving existing bugs and clarifying the scope of future work.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - The primary bug fix was the resolution of an issue where `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` always used default configurations, which was closed in conjunction with PR [#690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/690) ([#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/685)).
    - A task to refine alerts and runbooks for flashblocks was completed and closed ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17423)).
    - An older issue regarding the splitting of `op-node` components was closed as "not planned," clarifying the project's architectural direction ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16680)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened during this period.
    - Significant discussion occurred on an active issue concerning graceful monitoring and alerting for replica-healthchecks ([#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17686)). It was clarified that the implementation is intended for the infrastructure side, is currently blocked, and belongs to the Platforms Team Tracker, highlighting a cross-team dependency.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was most visible in the management of issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17686). A contributor submitted a PR to address the issue, but a maintainer clarified that the work was blocked and owned by another team. The interaction served as a valuable example of project coordination, with the maintainer guiding the contributor on the process for issue assignment and encouraging future contributions once the blocker is resolved.
