# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
November was a month of focused preparation and stabilization. Development centered on finalizing configurations for the upcoming Fusaka, BPO1, and BPO2 network upgrades by setting critical mainnet timestamps. Alongside this forward-looking work, the team enhanced network security by restricting mempool access and improved database stability by fixing a rare corruption bug. Significant progress was also made in cleaning up technical debt, with the closure of a long-standing flaky test and other maintenance-related issues. Active discussions around the `op-batcher` and `proxyd` components signal a continued focus on improving the robustness and efficiency of the Superchain infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Concrete progress was made in preparing for network upgrades and enhancing core client stability.

- **Network Upgrade & Superchain Configuration:**
  - Mainnet activation dates for the Fusaka, BPO1, and BPO2 upgrades were officially set, a critical step in coordinating the network-wide rollout ([#715](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/715)).
  - The Superchain registry was updated with new Jovian timestamps to ensure continued interoperability and synchronization across the ecosystem ([#716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/716)).

- **Security and Stability Enhancements:**
  - A security improvement was merged to restrict mempool access exclusively to trusted peers, giving node operators greater control over peer-to-peer interactions ([#719](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/719)).
  - A bug fix was implemented to address a rare database corruption edge case by synchronizing the ancient store before journaling, preventing potential history truncation errors ([#718](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/718)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on closing out preparatory work for the Fusaka upgrade and resolving long-standing maintenance items, while new discussions centered on the behavior of core components like `op-batcher`.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - The primary tracking issue for the Fusaka upgrade was closed, marking the completion of preparatory work that included upstream merges and the Sepolia release ([#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/682)).
  - A long-standing flaky test, `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor`, was finally resolved and closed, improving the reliability of the test suite ([#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17548)).
  - Technical debt was reduced by closing an issue for unused acceptance tests due to a shift in testing strategy ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16273)) and resolving a broken dependency in `op-chain-ops` ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16612)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - A significant discussion emerged around the `op-batcher`'s handling of rollup configurations ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18178)). The current method of fetching the config only at startup was identified as brittle, leading to proposals for a more dynamic reloading mechanism.
  - Brainstorming continued on how `proxyd` should handle unsynced backends to prevent "backwards time travel" for users ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/501)). Solutions like multicalls, error handling, and sticky sessions were weighed for their trade-offs.
  - Other notable discussions included improving blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher` ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18102)) and clarifying the spec for `op-batcher`'s max frame size in generic commitment mode ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17796)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. The conversation around `op-batcher` rollup config synchronization ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18178)) between `sebastianst` and `joshklop` highlighted a proactive approach to identifying and solving potential architectural weaknesses. Similarly, the ongoing dialogue on the `proxyd` backend sync issue ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/501)) and `op-batcher` frame sizes ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17796)) demonstrates a healthy process of collaborative problem-solving on complex topics that are crucial for the future stability and performance of the Superchain.
