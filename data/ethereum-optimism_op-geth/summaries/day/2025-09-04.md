## NEW ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Configuration
A new issue was opened to track the enablement of flashblocks on the `op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-1` mainnet sequencer, outlining associated PRs and remaining deployment tasks [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17317).

### Sync Tester Network Exposure
An issue was created to expose more networks inside the CI box for the `op-sync-tester`, aiming to facilitate testing L2CL syncing with real chain data [#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/454).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node/p2p/gossip` Configuration Overwrites [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17308)
Discussion continued regarding the `ConfigureGossip` function overwriting sane default values with zero values. `wood-jp` explained that this issue arose from a dependency update causing tests to panic due to invalid `Dhi` and `Dscore` values. `ajsutton` suggested adding a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to return a fully filled, valid configuration with sensible defaults to prevent future issues with invalid configurations.

### Flashblocks Deployment on Mainnet Sequencer [#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16759)
`yashvardhan-kukreja` provided an update on the progressive deployment of flashblocks on a mainnet sequencer. Associated PRs were linked, and remaining tasks include deploying `rollup-boost` in disabled mode, observing stability, and then enabling its execution mode.

### Flashblocks Deployment on Sunnyside Sequencers [#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16761)
`yashvardhan-kukreja` updated that both Sunnyside sequencers have `op-rbuilder` deployed and synced. Next steps involve deploying `rollup-boost` in disabled mode, deploying a backup sequencer without flashblocks, and enabling `execution_mode` based on flashblocks-enablement health.

### Flashblocks Websocket Proxy Deployment [#16763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16763)
`yashvardhan-kukreja` noted that this issue is currently blocked on the availability of websocket connections for conductors, but an associated PR is in progress to address it.

### Flashblocks RPC Node Deployment [#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16764)
`yashvardhan-kukreja` indicated a need to confirm the necessity of deploying a flashblocks-rpc node.

### Flashblocks Spec Finalization [#17162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17162)
`yashvardhan-kukreja` provided associated PRs for the Flashblocks spec, indicating ongoing work to finalize it.

### `op-geth` Init "head block is not reachable" Error [#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/420)
`cliff0412` reported encountering the same "head block is not reachable" error during `op-geth` initialization, indicating this remains an active concern for users setting up local testnets.

### Flashblocks Interop Acceptance Test [#16632](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16632)
`yashvardhan-kukreja` commented that this issue has been archived due to `op-node-v2` work revising interop, suggesting a shift in focus for interop testing.
