# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Oct 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on foundational changes related to calldata footprint limits and configurable data availability gas scalars, alongside addressing issues with flashblocks and dispute monitoring.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Calldata Footprint and Data Availability Gas Scalar Enhancements
Significant work was done on implementing a calldata footprint block limit spike, exploring multidimensional gas metering concepts without altering the EVM. This involved modifications to state processing, miner operations, and configuration parameters. Additionally, the data availability footprint gas scalar was made configurable, aligning with broader monorepo updates.
- Calldata footprint block limit spike ([#655](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/655))
- Configurable DA footprint gas scalar ([#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/675))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Stability Improvements
An issue regarding the loss of flashblocks when forwarding from rollup-boost to RPC nodes was identified and resolved. The fix involved addressing connectivity issues and subscriber pong timeouts in the flashblocks-websocket-proxy.
- Flashblocks-websocket-proxy issue with losing flashblocks ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17856))

### Flashblocks RPC Provider Coordination
Coordination efforts with Flashblocks RPC providers regarding a new Flashblocks RPC node were completed, with most providers having integrated the changes.
- Coordinate with Flashblocks RPC providers around the new Flashblocks RPC node ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17857))

### Dispute Monitor Sync Handling
Discussion continued on fixing the `op-dispute-mon`'s handling of out-of-sync nodes ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17814)). A proposed solution involves using `syncStatus` to determine the highest unsafe block across all nodes as the expected current L2 head. If a requested L2 block is greater, it's treated as a future proposal. For nodes that are behind, their results would be ignored. A PR was mentioned as a partial solution, and the issue was temporarily closed and then reopened pending the PR's merge. The conversation highlighted the challenge of trusting the highest L2 block, as it might originate from a node that followed an incorrect fork, suggesting that `CurrentL1` from the sync status might be a more reliable indicator of a node's sync state.
