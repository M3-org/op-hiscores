# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Oct 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing monitoring capabilities with a new gauge metric for block and blob gas usage. An active issue regarding a flaky test was discussed, and a previously identified issue concerning forwards-compatible game type retrieval in OPCM was closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Monitoring Enhancements
A new gauge metric has been added to track block gas used and blob gas used, improving observability of chain activity. ([#705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/705))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/705), was opened to add a gauge metric for block gas used and blob gas used.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### OPCM Game Type Retrieval
The issue regarding forwards-compatible game type retrieval in OPCM has been closed, as the necessary changes were incorporated into other work, and current OPCM functions calling `gameType()` are now specific to V1 contracts. ([#17933](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17933))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flaky Test Investigation
Discussion continued on the flaky test `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17966)). The latest comment from geoknee indicates difficulty in reproducing the failure locally and requests links to previous failures from mslipper to aid in debugging.
