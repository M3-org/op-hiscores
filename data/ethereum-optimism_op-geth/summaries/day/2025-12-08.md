## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on finalizing the Jovian hard fork, with feature toggles removed and new precompile input size limits tested.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Jovian Hard Fork Finalization
The feature toggles related to the Jovian hard fork have been removed, indicating the scope is now locked for this update. This streamlines the codebase by eliminating conditional logic for features that are now permanently integrated. ([#703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/703))

### Enhanced Precompile Input Limit Testing
New tests and comments have been added to thoroughly validate the updated precompile input size limits introduced with the Jovian hard fork. This ensures the robustness and correctness of these critical protocol changes. ([#731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/731))
