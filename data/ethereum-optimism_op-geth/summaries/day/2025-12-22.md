## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **`op-challenger` Trace Output Review:** Discussion continued on issue [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18643) regarding the correct trace output when the next super root is not found. The latest comment from ajsutton confirms that the super node trace provider now handles this correctly and suggests keeping the issue open until an integration test verifies the alignment between `op-challenger` and `op-program`. Previous comments from Inphi highlighted this as a real problem and discussed the behavior of `op-program` and `op-supervisor` in such scenarios.
