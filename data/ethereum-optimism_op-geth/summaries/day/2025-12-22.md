Discussions continued on an `op-challenger` issue related to trace output.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#740](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/740), was opened to complete the migration of Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions, streamlining the continuous integration process.

## CLOSED ISSUES
- The issue [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18317), concerning the implementation of external following for safe/finalized data in `op-node` using the `--l2.follow.source` flag, was closed. This indicates that the `op-node` implementation for mirroring external safe/finalized feeds is complete.

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- Discussion continued on [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18643), which addresses the review of correct trace output in `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found. The latest comment from ajsutton confirms that this functionality now works correctly in the super node trace provider. While `op-supervisor` will not be fixed as it's being deleted, the issue remains open pending an integration test to confirm `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments from Inphi highlighted this as a real problem, noting that `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash with insufficient data and questioning the correctness of a specific test.
