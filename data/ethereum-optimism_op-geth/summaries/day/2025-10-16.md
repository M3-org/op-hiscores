## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, including resolving an issue with OP Legacy header verification and implementing an operator fee fix. Several issues related to DA Footprint Limits and sequencer operations were closed, indicating progress in these areas.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Consensus and Rollup Cost Fixes
*   Fixed an issue where OP Legacy header verification was not correctly dispatched, ensuring proper handling of legacy headers ([#697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/697)).
*   Implemented a fix for the operator fee calculation, addressing a previous rewrite attempt ([#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/696)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/698) proposes using a read lock for Content, Pending, and ToJournal methods.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Enhancements
*   The acceptance test for the DA Footprint Limit was completed and closed ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17278)).
*   Unit tests for the DA Footprint Limit were added and the issue closed ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17395)).

### Sepolia Sequencer Adjustments
*   The issue regarding demoting and lightening `op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1` on Sepolia was closed, with a note that `prod-sepolia-op-opn-geth-f-sunnyseq-1` was removed instead ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17683)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Conductor and Sequencer Operation
*   A new issue was opened regarding a sequencer failing to start with the error "no unsafe head" after linking the conductor ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17899)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Operator Fee Saturating Math
*   Discussion continues on [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17888) regarding the need for saturating math in the `operatorFee` getter. The latest comment suggests that a recent analysis might imply no need for saturating math.
