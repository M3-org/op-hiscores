# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Oct 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, including resolving an issue with OP Legacy header verification and implementing an operator fee fix. Several issues related to DA Footprint Limit and sequencer operations were closed, indicating progress in these areas.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Consensus and Rollup Cost Fixes
*   Fixed an issue where OP Legacy header verification was not correctly dispatched, ensuring proper handling of legacy headers ([#697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/697)).
*   Implemented a fix for the operator fee calculation, addressing a previous rewrite attempt ([#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/696)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/698) proposes using a read lock for Content, Pending, and ToJournal methods.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Enhancements
*   The acceptance test for the DA Footprint Limit has been completed and closed ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17278)).
*   Unit tests for the DA Footprint Limit have been added and the issue closed ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17395)).

### Sepolia Sequencer Optimization
*   The issue regarding demoting and lightening the `op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1` on Sepolia has been closed, with a note that `prod-sepolia-op-opn-geth-f-sunnyseq-1` was removed instead ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17683)).

## NEW ISSUES
*   **Sequencer Startup Failure**: An issue was reported where `op-conductor` failed to start a sequencer with the error "no unsafe head" after linking the conductor ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17899)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Operator Fee Saturating Math Revisit
*   Discussion continues on [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17888) regarding the necessity of saturating math in the `operatorFee` getter. The latest comment suggests that current analysis might imply no need for saturating math.
