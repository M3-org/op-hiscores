# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Oct 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, including resolving an issue with OP Legacy header verification and implementing an operator fee fix. Several issues related to DA Footprint Limit and sequencer operations were closed, indicating progress in these areas.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Consensus and Rollup Cost Fixes
*   Fixed an issue in header verification to correctly dispatch to OP legacy pseudo consensus only for OP legacy headers, ensuring proper snap-sync for op-mainnet and op-sepolia ([#697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/697)).
*   Implemented a rewrite of the operator fee fix, addressing issues in rollup cost calculation ([#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/696)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/698) proposes using a read lock for Content, Pending, and ToJournal methods.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Enhancements
*   An acceptance test for the DA Footprint Limit was completed and closed ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17278)).
*   Unit tests for the DA Footprint Limit were added and the issue closed ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17395)).

### Sepolia Sequencer Adjustments
*   The issue regarding demoting and lightening op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1 of Sepolia was closed, with a note that op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1 was kept in the voter set and prod-sepolia-op-opn-geth-f-sunnyseq-1 was removed instead ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17683)).

## NEW ISSUES
*   No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Operator Fee Saturating Math
*   Discussion continues on the `jovian/operator-fee/GPO: revisit saturating math issue in operatorFee getter` ([#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17888)). The latest comment suggests that an analysis may imply no need for any saturating math, referencing a design document.

### Conductor Sequencer Startup Failure
*   An issue titled `op-conductor :Failed to start sequencer, err="no unsafe head"` ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17899)) was opened today. The user reported that after linking the conductor, the sequencer failed to start with the specified error. A request for assistance was made in the comments.
