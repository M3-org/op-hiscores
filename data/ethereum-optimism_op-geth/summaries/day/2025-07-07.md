## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node Interop Logic
Discussion on [#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16520) revolved around adding a mode to `op-node` to use pre-Interop logic in trivial-Interop cases, allowing it to function without a supervisor. The latest comment from tynes (Jul 9, 2025) indicates that this issue will be closed as it is no longer being prioritized. Earlier, tynes (Jul 7, 2025) questioned if a similar approach to `op-e2e` or `sysgo` (running services in the same process) would be viable.
