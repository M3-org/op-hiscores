## NEW ISSUES

### Mempool Configuration
A new issue was opened to add a flag to limit the transaction mempool only to trusted peers, similar to a previously discussed pull request [#717](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/717).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `proxyd` Backwards Time Travel with Unsynced Backends
Discussions continued on the issue of `proxyd` potentially returning previous blocks when backends are not in sync [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/501). Various approaches were brainstormed, including a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, `proxyd` handling "block out of range" errors, and IP-based or signature-based sticky sessions. The "multicall" strategy was noted to increase `eth_call` request forwards, while the "block out of range" error handling could lead to slower response times. The most reliable approach (signature-based sticky sessions) would require client-side changes. It was also noted that "backwards time travel" could affect `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory`.

### Blob Priority Fee Tracking
The issue of blob priority fee tracking in `op-batcher/txmgr` was discussed [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18102). A suggestion was made to have the starting priority fee for new transactions "decay" from the previous transaction rather than always starting at a set minimum, which could help the batcher handle backlogs more effectively. While this could be a quicker win, it was acknowledged that a dedicated blob priority fee tracker would provide a better estimate from the start, especially after a restart, though it would be a larger implementation effort.

### Update `migrate` method
Discussion on updating the `migrate` method [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17743) clarified that this issue specifically tracks OPCM changes, with devstack changes being covered by a separate issue.

### `op-acceptance-tests`: `sysgo` to support `flashblocks` / `rbuiders`
A comment on this issue [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16450) indicated a desire to implement this to validate changes related to `kona-node` and `rollup-boost`.
