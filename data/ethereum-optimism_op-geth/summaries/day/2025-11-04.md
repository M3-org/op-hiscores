## NEW ISSUES
### Transaction Mempool Configuration
A new issue [#717](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/717) was opened to add a flag that limits the transaction mempool only to trusted peers, similar to a previous pull request.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-acceptance-tests`: Sysgo Support for Flashblocks/Rbuilders
Discussion on [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16450) indicates a need for `sysgo` to support flashblocks/rbuiders to enable related tests. The latest comment from teddyknox expresses a desire to implement this to validate changes related to `kona-node` and `rollup-boost`.

### Update `migrate` method
On [#17743](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17743), the discussion clarifies that this issue specifically tracks OPCM changes, with devstack changes being covered in a separate issue. Inphi's latest comment suggests this issue might be ready for closure.

### `op-batcher/txmgr`: Blob Priority Fee Tracking
Issue [#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18102) continues to discuss strategies for tracking blob priority fees. sebastianst responded to a suggestion about decaying priority fees, noting that while it could be a special case, a dedicated blob priority fee tracker would provide better estimates from startup, despite being a larger implementation effort.

### `proxyd`: Backwards Time Travel When Backends Are Not in Sync
The discussion on [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/501) explores various approaches to prevent `proxyd` from returning previous blocks when backends are out of sync. joshklop highlighted that "backwards time travel" could affect `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_feeHistory` in addition to `eth_call`. yashvardhan-kukreja brainstormed several solutions, including a "multicall" strategy, silent fallbacks, and IP/signature-based sticky sessions, weighing their pros and cons regarding implementation complexity, client-side changes, and performance impact.
