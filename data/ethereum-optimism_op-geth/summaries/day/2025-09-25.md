# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Sep 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the introduction of a new experimental feature for a mint-burn precompile and a new issue to deduplicate Engine API validations. Discussions continued on preparing the op-batcher for Fusaka and improving the superchain-ops flow.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#687](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/687), was opened to experiment with a mint-burn precompile.

## CLOSED ISSUES

## NEW ISSUES
### Engine API Validation Deduplication
A new issue, [#688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/688), was opened to address the duplication of Engine API validation checks in `Miner.prepareWork`. The issue highlights that many validation checks for payload attributes are redundant, as they are already performed within `eth/catalyst/api_optimism.go`. A comment suggested moving additional checks, such as those for force-included L1 attributes deposit transactions and Jovian's 178-byte L1 attributes deposit data, into the Engine API checks.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Preparing op-batcher for Fusaka
Discussion on [#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17472) continued regarding the `op-batcher`'s adaptation to Fusaka's activation on L1. The latest comment provided a recipe for manual testing against a Fusaka L1, emphasizing the need for the batcher to send blob transactions with cell proofs instead of blob proofs.

### Improving Superchain-Ops Flow
On [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1224), feedback was provided on the `superchain-ops` signing flow. Key points from the discussion include:
- Clarification that "TODOs" in markdown are intentionally printed during task simulation for task developers, but not during actual signing.
- Acknowledgment that the inclusion of audit reports in the workflow is experimental and the language should be adjusted.
- The necessity of `op-txverify` for some signers is still under debate.
- Suggestions for improving markdown formatting and explanations, such as for the "normalized state diff hash."
- A PR was raised to address some of the identified snags.
