# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Jun 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on opening new pull requests to refine L1 data availability cost functions and remove Optimism-specific priority fee calculations. Discussions continued on optimizing op-batcher memory consumption and the trivial-interop mode for op-node.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### L1 Data Availability Cost Function Refinements
New pull requests were opened to address and refine the L1 Data Availability (DA) cost functions. This includes a general fix for the L1 DA cost function and an update specifically for calldata costs. These changes aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cost calculations within the system.
- [#630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/630)
- [#631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/631)

### Priority Fee Calculation Simplification
A new pull request was initiated to remove Optimism-specific priority fee estimate calculations. This change likely aims to streamline the fee estimation process and potentially align it more closely with standard Ethereum practices or broader Superchain interoperability goals.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Three new pull requests were opened today:
- [#630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/630) "Fix L1 DA cost function" aims to correct issues with how L1 data availability costs are calculated.
- [#631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/631) "Kaley.chicoine/update calldata cost" focuses on updating the specific cost associated with calldata.
- [#632](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/632) "Remove Optimism-specific priority fee estimate calculations" proposes to eliminate custom priority fee estimations.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Optimizing op-batcher Memory Consumption
Discussion on [#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16537) (spike(op-batcher): optimize memory consumption) continued with `geoknee` providing a detailed analysis using `pprof`. The analysis suggests that the compressor is the primary source of memory usage when a backlog of channels occurs in the batcher. `geoknee` outlined a recipe for reproducing the issue and proposed two optimizations: making the shadow compressor use half the memory and more eagerly discarding the compressor after channel submission. `sebastianst` suggested running a memory profiler.

### Trivial-Interop Mode for op-node
On [#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16519) (op-node: Trivial-interop mode without supervisor), `sebastianst` clarified that the goal is to prevent churn for chain operators by not requiring a supervisor for trivial depsets (size 1) in the coming months. This is a temporary measure until a better overall `op-supervisor` + `op-node` implementation is developed. This addresses `Inphi`'s earlier concern about the upgrade path for merging these chains.

### Removing Redundant Assertions
Discussion on [#16362](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16362) (Remove redundant assertions outside of the StandardValidator) saw `AmadiMichael` outlining a plan to remove redundant checks. The plan involves a two-set PR approach: first, removing checks from `Deploy*.s.sol` scripts that already exist in `ChainAssertions.sol`, and second, moving checks from `ChainAssertions.sol` to the `StandardValidator`. If the `StandardValidator` exceeds codesize limits, some checks will be moved to a child contract.
