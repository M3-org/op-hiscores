# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on maintenance and infrastructure updates, including a fix for Docker build failures and an update to the Superchain registry. Discussions continued on interop transaction evaluation and op-challenger trace output.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Infrastructure & Registry Updates
*   **Docker Build Fixes:** An attempt was made to resolve Docker build failures by updating `apk` packages within the Dockerfile ([#737](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/737)).
*   **Superchain Registry Synchronization:** The Superchain registry was updated to ensure consistency across the ecosystem ([#736](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/736)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kona Interop Test Re-enablement
*   The issue concerning disabled Kona interop action tests has been closed, with confirmation that the tests are now re-enabled. However, it was noted that Kona CI does not currently block on these tests, a change expected upon migration to the Optimism monorepo ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18613)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Op-Challenger Trace Output Review
*   A new issue was opened to review the correct trace output in `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found. This includes evaluating the behavior of `InvalidTransitionHash` and potential discrepancies in the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18643)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx
Discussions continued regarding the necessity and design of replacement transactions for invalid interop transactions.
*   **Simplifying the Spec:** There's a growing consensus to simplify the spec by removing the additional transaction, as it's deemed unnecessary for ZK proofs. The ZK proof system can re-run derivation and verify invalid data without needing a replacement transaction for quick dispute game resolution.
*   **Supernode Role:** The idea of the Supernode recording replacement data, similar to a "SafeDB for replacements," was discussed as a way to avoid needing the replacement transaction in the block.
*   **Proof System Requirements:** The additional transaction recording the replaced block hash was initially considered critical for the proofs system to avoid re-running derivation for the top half of the game. However, with ZK proofs, the derivation process is inherently re-run, potentially mitigating this concern.
*   **Gas Limit Concerns:** The risk of exceeding the block gas limit with an additional transaction was deemed low, given the fixed gas cost and reserved gas for system transactions.
*   **Actionable Steps:** The next steps involve assigning someone to architecturally refactor this mechanism and updating the Interop specification to reflect how the Superlayer will generate necessary data without an additional deposit transaction ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18574)).
