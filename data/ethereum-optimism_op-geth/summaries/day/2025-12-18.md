# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Dec 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on maintenance and infrastructure updates, including a Dockerfile fix and a Superchain Registry update. Discussions continued on interop transaction evaluation and op-challenger trace output.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Infrastructure & Registry Updates
*   **Dockerfile Fixes:** An attempt was made to resolve Docker build failures by updating `apk` within the Dockerfile ([#737](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/737)).
*   **Superchain Registry Update:** The Superchain Registry was updated, impacting `superchain-registry-commit.txt` and `superchain/superchain-configs.zip` ([#736](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/736)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kona Interop Test Re-enablement
*   The issue concerning disabled Kona interop action tests has been closed, with confirmation that these tests are now re-enabled. However, they do not yet block CI, a change planned for after Kona's migration to the Optimism monorepo ([#18613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18613)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Op-Challenger Trace Output Review
*   A new issue has been opened to review the correct trace output in `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found. This includes evaluating the behavior of `InvalidTransitionHash` and potential issues with the `NextSuperRootTimestampBeyondChainHead` test ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18643)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18574))
Discussions continue regarding the necessity of an additional transaction for replacement blocks in the interop protocol. The latest comments suggest a consensus on simplifying the protocol by removing the additional deposit transaction for proofs, as it may be unnecessary in a ZK proof system. It was noted that a ZK program execution would re-run the derivation process, making the replacement transaction less critical for dispute games. The next steps involve assigning someone to architecturally refactor this mechanism and updating the Interop specification to reflect how Superlayer will generate necessary data without the additional deposit.
