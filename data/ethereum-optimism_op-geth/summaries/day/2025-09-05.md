# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Sep 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on introducing a minimum base fee feature, enhancing the EIP-1559 mechanism within Optimism's `op-geth`. This involved significant changes across core components, alongside addressing forward compatibility for gas parameter extraction. Several issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Minimum Base Fee Implementation
A new feature introducing a minimum base fee has been integrated, building upon previous work. This enhancement modifies how base fees are calculated and enforced within the Optimism EIP-1559 implementation, impacting block parameters, API, and miner payload building. ([#666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/666))

### Forward-Compatible Gas Parameter Extraction
Work was completed to ensure the forward compatibility of Isthmus gas parameter extraction, specifically within the `core/types/rollup_cost.go` file. ([#671](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/671))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Minimum Base Fee Feature Integration
Three issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature have been closed, indicating successful integration and resolution. These include adding `minBaseFee` to the block header's `extraData` field ([#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/649)), incorporating an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3` ([#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/650)), and updating `eip1559.CalcBaseFee` to enforce the minimum when the feature is active ([#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/651)). All closures are directly linked to the implementation of pull request [#666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/666).

### NAT Testing Environment Shift
The issue concerning running `op-nat` in Kurtosis has been closed ([#158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/158)). This decision reflects a shift in priority towards other local development environments.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Large Genesis File Initialization Challenges
Discussion continues on an issue regarding `op-geth` initialization with a large 7GB genesis file, leading to a LevelDB panic ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/668)). The latest comment from @protolambda suggests that the Genesis-State-Spec (the "alloc" part of `genesis.json`) is optional and not typically stored in `geth`. The recommendation is to modify `op-geth` for a one-time state import by not storing the alloc data as a flat JSON blob and instead importing the state into the DB. It's also advised to include the `stateHash` attribute of the genesis block into the chain-`config` part of `genesis.json` to enable fresh nodes to snap-sync state from bootstrap nodes. This approach aligns with how `op-mainnet` operates, avoiding excessively large `op-geth` binaries or Docker images.

### Superchain Configuration Explicitness
An ongoing discussion revolves around making chain configurations fully explicit within the `superchain` package ([#763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/763)). The latest comment from @alfonso-op questions whether chain configurations are already self-descriptive and if the issue can be closed, indicating a potential resolution or clarification needed on the current state of configuration completeness.
