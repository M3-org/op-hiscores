# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Nov 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the opening of a new pull request related to downloader validation and a new issue discussing embellished error messages. An existing issue regarding Kona's Jovian action tests was closed, while discussions continued on issues concerning safe-head advancement and batcher safeguards.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#721](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/721), was opened to address downloader footprint validation.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Kona Test Enhancements
The issue [#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17303), which aimed to ensure Kona has passing action tests for Jovian, was closed. This was resolved by the addition of Jovian action tests in `op-e2e/actions/proofs`, which are also utilized by Kona's CI.

## NEW ISSUES
### Downloader Error Messaging
A new issue, [#722](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/722), was created to discuss the need for upstream embellished error messages in the downloader. This arose from a bug in the downloader's validation code that would have been more apparent with more informative error messages.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Safe-Head Advancement Optimization
Discussion continued on [#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15393) regarding the optimization of safe-head advancement by sending a single aggregate FCU message per channel. The latest comment from teddyknox highlights a merged pull request ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18234](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18234)) that may help address this issue. Previous discussions touched upon the problem of FCU spam when the batcher runs with considerable `--max-channel-duration`, and potential solutions like debouncing FCU calls or only advancing the safe head after a full channel has been derived.

### Cannon-Kona Prestate Documentation
The issue [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095) focuses on documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades. The latest update from Inphi indicates that discussions with devrel have confirmed the need to highlight this requirement in the Optimism documentation, especially for the U18 upgrade.

### Batcher Safeguard Improvements
On [#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18246), which aims to improve safeguards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig, geoknee noted a related issue ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17490)).
