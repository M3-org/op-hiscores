# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Nov 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the introduction of new GitHub Actions workflows for building and attesting `op-geth`, alongside a new pull request for data availability footprint validation. A key issue regarding Kona's Jovian action tests was closed, indicating progress in testing infrastructure.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened today:
- A pull request titled "downloader: da footprint validation" ([#721](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/721)) was opened, focusing on validating data availability footprints within the downloader.
- Another pull request, "ci: add GitHub Actions workflow to build and attest op-geth" ([#720](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/720)), introduces a new CI workflow to automate the building and attestation process for `op-geth`.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Kona Testing Enhancements
The issue "Ensure Kona has passing action tests for Jovian" ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17303)) was closed today. This indicates that Jovian action tests have been successfully integrated into `op-e2e/actions/proofs` and are now being run by Kona's CI.

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Optimizing Safe-Head Advancement FCU Messages
Discussion continued on "op-node: single aggregate safe-head advancement FCU message per channel" ([#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15393)). The latest comment from teddyknox highlights a merged change that may help address the issue of excessive FCU messages. Previous comments from clabby noted that `kona-node` has already implemented a solution to send only one FCU per span batch in the happy-path. The issue describes a problem where the `batcher` running with a considerable `--max-channel-duration` leads to a high volume of FCU messages, impacting performance.

### Documenting Cannon-Kona Prestate Requirement
The issue "Document cannonKonaPrestate requirement for upgrades" ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095)) saw a new comment from Inphi. The discussion confirms that the requirement for standard chains to set the `cannon-kona` prestate will be documented in the Optimism docs, especially in preparation for the U18 upgrade.

### Improving Batcher Update Safeguards
A new comment from geoknee on "Improve safe guards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig" ([#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18246)) linked a related issue, suggesting a broader context for improving safeguards around batcher updates.
