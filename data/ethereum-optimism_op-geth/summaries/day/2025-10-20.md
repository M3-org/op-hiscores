## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **DA Footprint Limit Implementation:** Discussion on [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17551) indicates that the implementation is currently blocked by the need for a spec derivation, as noted by sebastianst.
- **Jovian Rollup Config Compatibility:** On [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17907), the team is discussing whether to avoid marshaling new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active to prevent breaking zk stacks. geoknee is checking with @emilianobonassi regarding this possibility, emphasizing the importance of coordinated API updates.
- **Improving `op-up` for Local Development:** Issue [#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17942) highlights the need to enhance `op-up` to serve as a sysgo runner for local devnets, replacing Kurtosis. joshklop suggests considering whether a CLI tool is strictly necessary, given the simplicity of creating long-running acceptance tests.
