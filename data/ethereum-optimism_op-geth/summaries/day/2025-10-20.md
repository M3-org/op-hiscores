## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Jovian Compatibility and API Stability
Discussion on [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17907) revolves around preventing the marshaling of new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` until Jovian is active, as this change is breaking for zk stacks like op-succinct and kailua. The latest comment from geoknee indicates a plan to consult with @emilianobonassi regarding this possibility and emphasizes the general justification of not updating APIs in an uncoordinated way.

### Local Development Environment Tooling
Issue [#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17942) highlights the need to improve `op-up` to serve as a sysgo runner for local development, especially with the deprecation of Kurtosis. joshklop's comment suggests considering whether a CLI tool is strictly necessary, noting that creating a long-running acceptance test is already quite simple.

### Data Availability Footprint Limit Implementation
The implementation of the DA Footprint Limit, tracked in [#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17551), is currently blocked. sebastianst's latest comment clarifies that progress is dependent on the spec derivation outlined in [optimism/issues/17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17946).
