# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Nov 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing CI/CD with SLSA attestation, updating Superchain configurations, and refining transaction pool behavior for Optimism chains.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD and Supply Chain Security
*   A new GitHub Actions workflow was added to build `op-geth` Docker images and attach SLSA Build Level 3 in-toto provenance attestations, signed with Sigstore, to improve supply chain security. ([#720](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/720))

### Superchain Configuration and Optimism Chain Updates
*   The Superchain registry was updated to reflect new Jovian timestamps. ([#724](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/724))
*   The downloader now skips the `blobGasUsed` check for Optimism chains on Jovian. ([#723](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/723))

### Transaction Pool Management
*   A new flag, `RollupNetrestrictTxPoolGossipFlag`, was introduced to control transaction pool gossip behavior. ([#706](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/706))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Transaction Pool Configuration
*   An issue requesting a flag to limit the transaction mempool to trusted peers was closed, addressed by the new `RollupNetrestrictTxPoolGossipFlag`. ([#717](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/717))

### Development Environment Support
*   The issue regarding `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` support for `sysext` was closed, with a note indicating that Kurtosis is being deprecated. ([#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16704))

## NEW ISSUES

### Prestate Support for Kona
*   A tracking issue was opened to add support for embedded custom prestates to Kona. ([#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18271))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Report Script
*   Discussion continues on updating the `print_staging_report` script to be compatible with Dispute Game v2. ([#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1148))
    *   `kelvin7891` noted that the script needs adaptation to read `gameArgs` from the DGF storage if available, as it currently reads from the game implementation contract.
    *   `ajsutton` previously pointed out that the script assumes only Permissioned and Permissionless games, but there will be two permissionless games, which might cause disruption if the JSON output format changes.
    *   `ajsutton` also clarified that the `DeployedEvent` has `FaultDisputeGame` but it's not used by the script or included in the final report, so the format might not need changing.

### Embedded Custom Prestes to Kona
*   Discussion on adding support for embedded custom prestates to Kona. ([#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18271))
    *   `Inphi` mentioned that a fix is currently under review.
