# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Nov 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `op-geth` build process with new CI workflows for provenance attestation, updating Superchain configurations, and refining transaction pool behavior. Several issues were closed, including one related to mempool configuration and another concerning `op-sync-tester` support.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Build and Attestation Process
A new GitHub Actions workflow was introduced to build `op-geth` Docker images and attach SLSA Build Level 3 in-toto provenance attestations, signed with Sigstore, improving supply chain security. ([#720](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/720))

### Superchain Configuration and Transaction Handling Updates
Updates were made to the Superchain registry for new Jovian timestamps. Additionally, a flag was added to restrict transaction pool gossip, and a check for `blobGasUsed` was skipped for Optimism chains on Jovian during downloading. ([#706](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/706), [#724](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/724), [#723](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/723))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Embedded Custom Prestes to Kona
Discussion on [#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18271) indicates that a fix for adding support for embedded custom prestates to Kona is currently under review, with a pull request linked for reference.

### Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Report Script
On [#1148](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1148), recent comments highlight the need to adapt the `print_staging_report` script to read `gameArgs` from the DGF for dispute-game v2 compatibility. There's also a concern about the script's assumption of only two game types (Permissioned and Permissionless) when two permissionless games will eventually exist, and the potential disruption changes to the JSON output might cause.
