## CLOSED ISSUES

### Engine API and Interop Transaction Management
Several issues related to the Engine API and interop transaction handling were closed. This includes ensuring Engine API status/error return values match specifications ([#596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/596)), adding an RPC to drop interop transactions from the mempool ([#618](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/618)), and addressing a bug where invalid interop transactions were conditionally included in the txpool ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/635)).

### State Database and Node Stability
An issue concerning op-geth full node state DB corruption after an upgrade path ([#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/549)) was closed due to age, with a note to reopen if the issue recurs. Another issue regarding thousands of stuck goroutines in `p2p.SyncClient / libp2p` in `op-node` ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16332)) was also closed due to age, with a request to reopen if it persists in later releases.

### Test Flakiness and Acceptance Test Improvements
Multiple flaky tests were addressed and closed, including `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17966)) and `TestMissingBatchE2E` ([#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18138)). Additionally, the issue to parallelize the "memory-all" job in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17525)) was closed as it is no longer needed.

### Deprecated Features and Relevance Checks
Issues related to deprecated features or those requiring relevance checks were closed. This includes an issue to fix the address book in `op-devstack: sysext` ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15817)) due to KT deprecation, and issues concerning `min-base-fee` simulations ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16958)) and runbooks for low batcher throughput ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16959)) where their relevance was questioned. An issue to add `op-reth` back to the Jovian kt-devnet ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17475)) was also closed, with a note to ensure `op-reth` is integrated into the devstack/sysgo system instead.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flaky Test: TestBreakTimestampInvariant
The issue [#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18137) regarding the flaky test `TestBreakTimestampInvariant` remains open. A recent comment from mslipper on 2025-11-17 provided an example failure link, indicating ongoing investigation into this test's instability.
