## CLOSED ISSUES

### Addressing Aged and Deprecated Issues
Several older issues were closed due to their age or because they pertained to deprecated features. This includes an issue regarding Engine API return values [#596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/596), an RPC for dropping interop transactions [#618](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/618), and a state DB corruption issue [#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/549). Additionally, issues related to the deprecated KT local devnet [#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15817) and L2 network divergence in reorg tests [#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15782) were closed. A goroutine-related issue in op-node v1.13.3 [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16332) was also closed due to age.

### Min-Base-Fee Feature Review
Issues related to the `min-base-fee` feature, specifically concerning simulations [#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16958) and runbooks for low batcher throughput [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16959), were reviewed for their current relevance.

### Test Suite Maintenance
Efforts were made to address flaky tests and optimize the test suite. A flaky test related to `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` [#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17966) was closed as it hasn't been observed recently. The issue concerning parallelizing the "memory-all" job in op-acceptance-tests [#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17525) was also closed as it is no longer needed. A flaky test `TestMissingBatchE2E` [#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18138) was closed, with logs provided for its failure.
