# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Sep 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, development focused on integrating the latest Go-Ethereum updates and addressing a long-standing issue regarding redundant address structs. A new discussion also emerged concerning conventions for network upgrade transactions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/684), was opened to merge `go-ethereum v1.16.3`, indicating an effort to keep `op-geth` up-to-date with the upstream Geth client.

## CLOSED ISSUES

- **Address Struct Consolidation**: The issue [#14977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/14977), which aimed to create a single source of truth for address structs and eliminate duplication across `op-deployer` and `op-chain-ops`, was closed. The maintainer, alfonso-op, confirmed that the intended scope was completed.

## NEW ISSUES

- **Network Upgrade Transaction Convention**: A new issue, [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/781), was opened to establish a new convention for network upgrade transactions that deploy new contracts. The issue highlights the current practice of using a unique `from` address with `nonce=0` and seeks to enshrine a more robust and collision-resistant method for determining deployer addresses.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Enshrining New Convention for Network Upgrade Transactions** ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/781)): The discussion revolves around establishing a new convention for network upgrade transactions that deploy new contracts. Protolambda provided a detailed note on address collision resistance for the suggested approach, comparing `CREATE`, `CREATE2`, and the proposed upgrade source-hash method. They also suggested using the `CREATE2` computation with a system address and the source-hash as salt for enhanced safety and to fit within existing address computation frameworks.
