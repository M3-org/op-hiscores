## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes
Discussions on [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15789) continued, focusing on necessary OPCM changes to support recent updates. The latest comment from stevennevins on July 9, 2025, outlines a detailed checklist of tasks, including moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, removing `anchorStateRegistry` from `StandardValidatorOverrides`, unskipping and updating tests in `DeployOPChain.t.sol`, reviewing comment responses, addressing TODO comments, rebasing updates from EVM safety refactoring, and fixing Go updates in integration tests. A previous comment from stevennevins on June 10, 2025, referenced a related pull request in the `optimism` repository ([#16340](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16340)).

### op-supervisor: Event Overflow on Large Unsafe Head Gap
The issue [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16335) addresses a critical problem where the op-supervisor can crash-loop due to an event overflow when the unsafe head gap grows too large. Recent comments highlight ongoing efforts to diagnose and mitigate this. On June 19, 2025, nonsense proposed adding a gauge for in-flight events within `GlobalSyncExec` to identify the problematic event type and suggested setting up an alert for total in-flight events. Earlier discussions on June 17, 2025, involved sebastianst and nonsense debating whether `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` was the culprit, with axelKingsley clarifying on June 10, 2025, that `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` does not stack up and is a response to `ChainProcess` events, suggesting other events might be causing the overflow. Nonsense also mentioned working on adding a counter per event type to gather more data for debugging.
