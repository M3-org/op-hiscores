## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-program` Hinting for Fast Block Header Lookup
The issue [#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17416) was closed, confirming that a hint has been added to `op-program` to facilitate fast block header oracle lookups. While `op-geth` still relies on `debug_dbGet`, this change aligns with `kona-client`'s approach to reading storage slots directly.

### Kona Compatibility with Acceptance Tests
The issue [#18203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18203) was closed, indicating that `kona` has been updated to resolve compatibility issues with websocket URLs in acceptance tests. This addresses a previous incompatibility where `kona` did not support websockets for L2 EL connections, while `sys go` only provided websocket URLs.

### `op-program`: Add hint for fast block header oracle lookup ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17416))
This issue was closed today. The latest comment from ajsutton confirms that a hint has been added to `op-program` to assist with fast block header oracle lookups. Although `op-geth` continues to use `debug_dbGet`, this change is noted as aligning with `kona-client`'s direct storage slot lookup logic. The issue is considered resolved.
