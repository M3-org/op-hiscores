## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-program` Hinting for Fast Block Header Lookup
- The issue [#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17416) was closed, as a hint has been added to `op-program` to provide key information for fast block header oracle lookups. While `op-geth` still uses `debug_dbGet`, `kona-client`'s direct storage slot lookup benefits from this hint.

### Kona Compatibility with Acceptance Tests
- The issue [#18203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18203) was closed, indicating that `kona` has been updated to resolve compatibility issues with websocket URLs in acceptance tests. Previously, `kona` did not support websockets for L2 EL connections, which caused conflicts with `sys go`'s websocket-only provision.
