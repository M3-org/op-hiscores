# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Oct 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on preparing for the Jovian hard fork by introducing new precompile limits and initiating work on populating Jovian receipt fields.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Jovian Hard Fork Preparations
New precompile limits for the upcoming Jovian hard fork were introduced to reflect more realistic limits on accelerated precompiles. This work involved modifications to `core/vm` and `params` directories. ([#709](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/709))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/710), was opened to populate Jovian receipt fields within `core/types`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Enhanced End-to-End Testing for op-deployer
The issue concerning the need for more end-to-end testing for `op-deployer` was closed, as many new CLI-level integration tests have recently been introduced. ([#16842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16842))

## NEW ISSUES

### Jovian Receipt Field Population
A new issue was created to track the addition and population of new fields, `daFootprintGasScalar` and `blobGasUsed`, to the API receipt for the Jovian hard fork. ([#708](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/708))
