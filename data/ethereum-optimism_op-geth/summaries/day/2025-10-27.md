# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Oct 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on preparing for the Jovian hard fork by introducing new precompile limits and addressing receipt field population. An issue related to `op-deployer` end-to-end testing was closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Jovian Hard Fork Preparation
New precompile limits for the upcoming Jovian hard fork were introduced, aiming for more realistic limits on accelerated precompiles. This work involved modifications to `core/vm/contracts.go`, `core/vm/contracts_test.go`, and `params/protocol_params.go`. ([#709](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/709))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Enhanced `op-deployer` Testing
An issue concerning the need for more end-to-end testing for `op-deployer` was closed, with the rationale that many new CLI-level integration tests have recently been introduced. ([#16842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16842))

## NEW ISSUES

### Jovian Receipt Field Enhancements
A new issue was opened to add and populate new receipt fields, `daFootprintGasScalar` and `blobGasUsed`, for the Jovian hard fork. This follows the pattern established in previous forks for API receipt data. ([#708](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/708))
