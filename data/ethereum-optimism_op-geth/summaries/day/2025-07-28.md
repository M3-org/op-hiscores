## NEW ISSUES
Two new issues were opened today, both related to the `min-base-fee` feature:
- **Block Header and Payload Attributes Updates:** An issue was created to add `minBaseFee` to the block header's `extraData` field, referencing a design document and a related specs issue: [#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/649).
- **Payload Attributes V3 Extension:** A separate issue was opened to add an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3`, emphasizing feature-fork separation and referencing the same specs issue: [#650](https://github.ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/650).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
**Min Base Fee Tracking:**
The tracking issue [#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16807) for the Min Base Fee feature saw recent activity. On July 28, 2025, `wlawt` provided an update on other in-flight work relevant to this feature, specifically mentioning progress in `op-alloy` ([#580](https://github.com/alloy-rs/op-alloy/pull/580)) and `optimism` ([#16852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16852)). Later, on August 1, 2025, `wlawt` also added an early reth draft ([#17704](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/17704)) for review to facilitate early decision-making. Most recently, on September 3, 2025, `geoknee` linked to the relevant specs document ([https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/jovian/overview.html](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/jovian/overview.html)).
