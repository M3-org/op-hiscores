# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Jun 6, 2025)

## OVERVIEW

Today's development focused on Superchain configuration updates, importing new rehearsal configurations, and addressing an issue with `op_contracts_manager_addr` unmarshaling. Discussions on active issues revolved around `op-supervisor` improvements for fault proofs and L1 origin validity during resets.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Configuration Updates
The Superchain registry import commit was updated to include the latest `rehearsal-0-bn` configurations. This update also identified an issue with the `op_contracts_manager_addr` field unmarshaling from `superchain.toml`. ([#625](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/625))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

A new pull request, [#628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/628) "Karlb/only transfer precompile", was opened. Its current status and progress are pending further review.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Test Suite Fixes
The issue [#16187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16187), "op-acceptance-tests: Fix interop sync test which relied on supervisor multinode support," was closed. This fix addressed issues with `TestUnsafeChainKnownToL2CL` and `TestUnsafeChainUnknownToL2CL` which were previously skipped due to their dependency on supervisor multi-node support. An additional test, `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor`, was also identified as needing a fix due to similar dependencies.

## NEW ISSUES

### Supervisor L1 Origin Handling
A new issue, [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16315) "op-supervisor: Improve L1 origin validity handling during resets," was opened. This issue highlights that the supervisor's reset logic currently lacks checks for the canonical L1 origin of the target, potentially leading to inconsistencies. The discussion suggests that after bisecting to a common safe block, the L1 origin of the found reset target should be verified, and if not canonical, the safe chain should be walked back until a valid L1 origin is found.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fault Proofs with Non-Genesis Interop
Discussions on [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16166) "op-supervisor: Fix ability to provide data for fault proofs with non-genesis interop" continued. The core problem is the `op-challenger`'s inability to fully support non-Genesis Interop upgrades, specifically when proving the non-genesis activation block.

*   **Latest Comments:** `sebastianst` (2025-06-06T17:42:28Z) noted that fixing this issue would allow for the removal of the `op-node`'s safe DB for managed nodes. `ajsutton` (2025-06-06T01:12:00Z) emphasized that fixing this in the challenger would require it to aggregate sync status and super roots from multiple rollup node endpoints, suggesting it would be more logical to handle this in the supervisor, which already manages `op-node` endpoints and super root creation.

### Incorrect Nonce for Pending Transactions
Issue [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/623) "eth_getTransactionCount returns incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending txs" remains active. This bug causes `eth_getTransactionCount` to return an incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending transactions, leading to transactions getting stuck in the mempool.

*   **Latest Comments:** `mukul3097` (2025-06-12T16:59:13Z) and `ntrzr` (2025-06-09T11:27:43Z) are awaiting updates on this issue.
