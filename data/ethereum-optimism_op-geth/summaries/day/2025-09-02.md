## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona + Cannon Support for OPCM
Discussion continued on verifying the necessary changes in OPCM to support Kona + Cannon ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17285)). The latest comment from ajsutton (2025-09-03T00:12:04Z) indicates that OPCM will need to support deploying the new game type, specifically updating a conditional block in `OPContractsManager.sol`. Previously, pauldowman (2025-09-02T16:09:33Z) suggested confirming if any changes are needed before closing the issue.

### Kona + Cannon Support for op-dispute-mon
The issue regarding `op-dispute-mon` support for Kona + Cannon games saw further discussion ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17286)). pauldowman (2025-09-02T21:25:01Z) clarified the issue to "Update to support cannon-kona games." This followed ajsutton's comment (2025-09-01T20:55:30Z) emphasizing that `dispute-mon` must return an error for unsupported game types and will require updates to support cannon-kana game types.
