# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Sep 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, a critical bug fix was implemented for deposit receipt correction in the `eth/downloader` component, resolving an issue introduced by a previous upstream merge. Additionally, the `superchain-registry` was updated to a newer version.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Critical Bug Fix for Deposit Receipt Correction
A significant bug in the `eth/downloader` component related to deposit receipt correction was fixed. This issue, which caused problems during snap sync due to changes in how receipts are transferred upstream, was resolved by adjusting the handling of storage RLP. This fix is crucial for maintaining the stability and reliability of the syncing process. ([#680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/680))

### Superchain Registry Update
The `superchain-registry` was updated to a newer version, specifically by bumping the commit reference in `superchain-registry-commit.txt`. This update likely includes an addresses cleanup and ensures the project is aligned with the latest Superchain configurations. ([#672](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/672))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#681](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/681) titled "[Do Not Merge] bypass static interop filters," was opened. Its status indicates it is not yet ready for merging.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolution of Receipt Correction Failure
The issue [#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/679), concerning "Receipt Correction: Failed to decode RLP receipts," was closed today. This bug, which caused Geth to crash during full sync on op-mainnet, was confirmed to be fixed with the latest version patch, likely referring to the fix implemented in [#680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/680).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Addressing Flakiness in `TestPreNoInbox`
The issue [#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17298), "op-acceptance-tests: Tame `TestPreNoInbox` flakiness," continues to be active. The latest comment indicates that a previous attempt to fix the issue in `optimism/optimism` pull request [#17495](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17495) did not resolve the flakiness, as another flake was observed.

### Clarification on Token Bridging Issue
Issue [#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1203), "Clarification on PR #1184 and Token Bridging Issue," is active with recent discussion. The main point of discussion revolves around why a specific token is not bridging to another on Base, despite a related PR being merged. A maintainer clarified that the `superbridgeapp` is not a maintainer for this repository and suggested that the issue might stem from the target token not being an `OptimismMintableERC20`, which would explain why the generated entry lacks a bridge address. Further verification of the implementation is needed.

### Cleaning Up `protocol/system-config.md`
The issue [#771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/771), "Clean up `protocol/system-config.md`," is active with a recent suggestion. The discussion focuses on improving the documentation for config updates, specifically by including both the numerical value and canonical name for update enums (e.g., `MIN_BASE_FEE` and `6`). It also suggests linking to fork-specific specifications for config updates introduced by hard forks.
