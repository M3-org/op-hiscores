# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Sep 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the `sync-superchain.sh` script for improved robustness and addressing issues related to large genesis files and metric reporting.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Sync Script Enhancement
A modification was made to the `sync-superchain.sh` script to prevent errors when a non-standard genesis file, intended for deletion, does not exist. This change improves the script's resilience and facilitates testing of Kona prestates. ([#673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/673))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#674](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/674) `core: Log DA usage estimates`: This new pull request aims to add logging for Data Availability (DA) usage estimates within the core functionality.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolution of Large Genesis File Initialization Panic
An issue where `op-geth init` would panic with a large 7GB genesis file has been closed. The discussion highlighted that the `genesis.json`'s "alloc" part (Genesis-State-Spec) is optional and not typically stored in `geth` for production chains like op-mainnet. The recommended solution involves not storing the alloc data as a flat JSON blob and including the `stateHash` attribute in the chain-`config` of `genesis.json` to enable snap-syncing from other bootstrap nodes. ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/668))

### Improved Throttling Intensity Metric for op-batcher
The issue concerning the `op-batcher`'s throttling intensity metric has been closed. The problem was that the metric was always set for all controllers, with inactive ones showing 0. A solution was implemented in Grafana to only plot values greater than 0, making it easier to visualize active controllers and their intensity. ([#17149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17149))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis: Ability to use local op-geth build ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16975))
The discussion revolves around enabling Kurtosis to use a local `op-geth` build instead of relying on the pinned version from `optimism-package`. A suggestion was made to leverage the templating system for automatic overriding. This could involve using an image reference like `{{ $remote_images.op-geth-go-mod }}` which resolves to a Docker image URL constructed from the `go.mod` githash, assuming Docker images are built for every commit. Alternatively, the source code could be cloned temporarily using the `go.mod` githash, and a local Docker image built from it.
