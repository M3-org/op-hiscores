Several issues related to sequencer operation and recovery were closed. This includes [#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/11228), concerning recovery from sequence window expiration incidents, and [#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/12240), addressing sequencer halting due to temporary errors.
