## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node Synchronization Challenges
Discussions continued on [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18510), where users reported that op-node v1.16.3 was preventing synchronization for Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments. The latest comment from geoknee requested more detailed logs and metrics, and suggested upgrading op-geth to v1.101603.5, noting that the reported log line is not uncommon after an op-node restart.

### Development of an op-spammer Component
On [#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18482), which proposes creating a new op-spammer component for devnet deployments, geoknee suggested that existing "Prior art" from the flashbots/contender repository might be sufficient.

### Sysgo Support for Flashblocks
The issue [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16450), concerning sysgo's lack of awareness of flashblocks/rbuiders, saw a new comment from geoknee asking if the issue is resolved. This follows an earlier comment from teddyknox expressing a desire to implement this to validate kona-node + rollup-boost changes.
