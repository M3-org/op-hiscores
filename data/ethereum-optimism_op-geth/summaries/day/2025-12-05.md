## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node Synchronization Issues
Issue [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18510) reports that upgrading op-node to v1.16.3 is causing Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments to fail synchronization. The latest comment from J1a-wei provides the specific op-geth and op-node image versions being used: `us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-geth:v1.101603.4` and `us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-node:v1.16.3`.

### Development of an op-spammer Component
Discussion on [#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18482) continues regarding the creation of a new `op-spammer` component for devnet deployments. The latest comment from geoknee suggests that existing "prior art" like https://github.com/flashbots/contender might be sufficient for this purpose.

### sysgo Support for Flashblocks/Rbuilders
On issue [#16450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16450), which concerns sysgo's lack of awareness for flashblocks/rbuiders, geoknee inquired if the task is complete. This follows an earlier comment from teddyknox indicating a desire to implement this to validate a `kona-node + rollup-boost` change.
