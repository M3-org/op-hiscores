## ACTIVE ISSUES
**SuperchainConfig Type Porting Discussion**
Issue [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/741), concerning the porting of the `SuperchainConfig` type from `superchain-registry`, saw recent activity. @Himess confirmed opening a PR ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/867)) after incorporating feedback from @emhane regarding the notation for the type definition, emphasizing that it should not use Go syntax and should align with existing spec formats. This follows an earlier commit by @Himess to their `specs` fork.

**SPIKE: Decide how to support challenging ZK games**
Issue [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18322) was closed today. The final decision, as stated by @ajsutton, is to proceed with `op-challenger`. This decision was made after considering options such as using a succinct challenger or integrating challenging into the proposer, with @Inphi noting that the challenger logic is straightforward enough for `op-challenger` to handle, even with a potential future shift to a Rust-based challenger.
