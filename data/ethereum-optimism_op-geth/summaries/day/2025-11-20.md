# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on integrating new `go-ethereum` versions and addressing a critical issue related to the `AnchorStateRegistry` within the dispute game framework. A runbook for low batcher throughput was also completed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **`go-ethereum` Version Updates**: Two new pull requests were opened to merge recent `go-ethereum` versions: [#728](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/728) for `v1.16.7` and [#727](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/727) for `v1.16.6`.
- **Fork Difference Analysis**: A new pull request, [#729](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/729), titled "falcorocks/forkdiff" was opened, likely related to analyzing differences between forks.

## CLOSED ISSUES

- **Batcher Throughput Runbook**: Issue [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16959), concerning a runbook for low batcher throughput, was closed today. A runbook has been created to address scenarios where `MinBaseFee` might be set too high, leading to reduced transaction inclusion.

## NEW ISSUES

- **AnchorStateRegistry Dependency**: A new issue, [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18347), was opened to discuss removing the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry`. This aims to resolve issues where the current cast to `IFaultDisputeGame` might not work for all game types.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **AnchorStateRegistry Dependency Refinement**: In issue [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18347), discussions revolve around the `AnchorStateRegistry`'s dependency on `IFaultDisputeGame`. The latest comments question the necessity of the sanity check for the same ASR, suggesting that deployment-time checks via `OPStandardValidator` might suffice. An alternative proposal is to expand the `IDisputeGame` interface to explicitly require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method.
