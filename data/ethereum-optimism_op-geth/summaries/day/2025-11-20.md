# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on integrating new `go-ethereum` versions and addressing a critical runbook for low batcher throughput. A new issue regarding `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency was also opened.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **`go-ethereum` Version Updates**: Two pull requests were opened to merge new versions of `go-ethereum`: [#728](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/728) for `v1.16.7` and [#727](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/727) for `v1.16.6`.
- **Fork Difference Analysis**: A new pull request, [#729](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/729), titled "falcorocks/forkdiff" was opened, likely related to analyzing differences between forks.

## CLOSED ISSUES

- **Batcher Throughput Runbook**: Issue [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16959), concerning a runbook for low batcher throughput, was closed today. A runbook has been created to address scenarios where `MinBaseFee` might be set too high, leading to transactions not being included.

## NEW ISSUES

- **Dispute Game Dependency Refinement**: A new issue, [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18347), was opened to discuss removing the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency from `AnchorStateRegistry`. This aims to resolve issues where the `anchorStateRegistry()` method might not be present in all game types, and to re-evaluate the necessity of a sanity check that verifies the `AnchorStateRegistry` from the dispute game.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Min-Base-Fee Runbook for Low Batcher Throughput**: Issue [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16959) was closed today. The latest comment from `geoknee` confirms the creation of a runbook to address low batcher throughput scenarios, specifically when the `MinBaseFee` might be too high. This runbook is intended to guide responses to alerts detecting such issues.

- **Remove IFaultDisputeGame dependency from AnchorStateRegistry**: Issue [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18347) is actively being discussed. `ajsutton` questioned the necessity of the sanity check that verifies the `AnchorStateRegistry` from the dispute game, suggesting that deployment-time checks might already cover this. `Inphi` countered by emphasizing the value of the sanity check and proposed expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface to include an `AnchorStateRegistry` method. `ajsutton` further noted that adding `wasRespectedAtGameCreation` already ties dispute game implementations to the anchor state registry, potentially making the current dependency less problematic.
