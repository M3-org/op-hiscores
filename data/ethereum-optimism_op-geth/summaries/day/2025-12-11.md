## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Node Synchronization Failures on Optimism-based Chains
The issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581), titled "the node is not synchronized," highlights widespread synchronization problems reported by users on Base, Optimism, and Unichain. Users are encountering "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. The issue was created on 2025-12-11T19:21:37Z.

*   **Initial Reports and Observations:** Users like @bayardar and @yaki-1337 reported experiencing the same errors across multiple nodes running `op-geth v1.101603.5 jovian` and `op-node v1.16.3`, particularly when attempting to sync with snapshots from publicnode.com. There were also unconfirmed reports that Optimism and Arbitrum were down, with some suggesting a client update might be needed.
*   **Potential Workarounds:** @tsulhc noted that while Publicnode snapshots caused issues, `snapsync` with `--syncmode=execution-layer` successfully synced a new Unichain node.
*   **Request for Diagnostic Information:** @rdin777, in the latest comment (2025-12-15T06:55:54Z), acknowledged the problem and requested detailed diagnostic information from affected users. This includes:
    *   Configuration of L1 Execution Client (e.g., Geth, Erigon) and L1 Consensus Client (e.g., Prysm, Lighthouse).
    *   Full logs for both Op-Node and L1 Execution Client for the last 5-10 minutes.
    *   Complete list of flags (startup commands) for all three clients.
    The aim is to diagnose why the L1 Execution Client might not be providing necessary state data to the Op-Node for L2 block creation.
