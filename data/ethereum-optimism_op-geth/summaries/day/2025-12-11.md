## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Node Synchronization Failures on Optimism-based Chains
A critical issue, [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581), was reported concerning nodes failing to synchronize. Users are experiencing "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. This problem appears to affect multiple chains, including Base, Optimism, and Unichain, particularly when attempting to sync with snapshots from publicnode.com. There's speculation that a client update might be necessary. The latest comment from `rdin777` requests detailed configuration information (L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client, full logs, and client flags) to diagnose the issue further.
