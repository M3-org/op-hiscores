# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Nov 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development primarily focused on a significant merge of `go-ethereum v1.16.4`, impacting various core components including `accounts/usbwallet`, `cmd/evm`, and `cmd/keeper`. This merge indicates a substantial update to the underlying Ethereum client.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Geth Client Update
A major update to the underlying `go-ethereum` client was merged, bringing `v1.16.4` into `op-geth`. This merge involved changes across numerous files, particularly within `accounts/usbwallet`, `cmd/evm`, `cmd/keeper`, `cmd/geth`, and `accounts/abi`, indicating a broad refresh of core functionalities and dependencies. ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/689))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened: one to merge `go-ethereum v1.16.5` ([#726](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/726)), suggesting a rapid follow-up to the previously merged Geth version, and another titled "basefee + debug logs" ([#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/725)), which likely introduces new features or improvements related to base fee calculations and debugging capabilities.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Min-Base-Fee Simulation and Production Monitoring
The discussion around issue [#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16958), concerning simulations for the `min-base-fee` feature, concluded with a decision to monitor its performance in production rather than conducting further simulations. The latest comment from `geoknee` on November 19, 2025, states, "No, I think the approach now is to see how the feature works in production," indicating a shift in strategy from pre-production testing to live observation.

### Cannon-Kona Prestate Documentation for Upgrades
Issue [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095) highlights the need to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades. The latest update from `ajsutton` on November 19, 2025, confirms that the documentation team has received a "one pager" that includes this requirement, suggesting progress towards clarifying this crucial aspect for standard chains. Previously, `Inphi` noted that this requirement is a concern for the U18 upgrade and would be highlighted in Optimism's documentation.
