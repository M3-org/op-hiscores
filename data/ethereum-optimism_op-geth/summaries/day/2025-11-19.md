# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Nov 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development primarily focused on a significant merge of `go-ethereum v1.16.4`, impacting various core components and preparing for future updates. Discussions also continued on existing issues, including the `min-base-fee` feature and `cannonKonaPrestate` requirements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Geth Integration and Updates
A major merge of `go-ethereum v1.16.4` was completed, bringing in numerous updates across various modules. This integration involved changes to `accounts/usbwallet`, `cmd/evm`, `cmd/keeper`, and `cmd/geth`, among others, ensuring `op-geth` remains aligned with upstream `go-ethereum` developments. ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/689))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#726](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/726), was opened to merge `go-ethereum v1.16.5`, indicating ongoing efforts to keep `op-geth` up-to-date with the latest upstream changes.
- Another pull request, [#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/725), was opened concerning `basefee + debug logs`, suggesting potential enhancements or fixes related to base fee calculations and debugging capabilities.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `min-base-fee` Feature Evaluation
The issue concerning simulations for the `min-base-fee` feature, [#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16958), was closed. The current approach is to observe the feature's performance in a production environment rather than conducting further simulations.

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-program` VM Compatibility Fix
A new issue, [#18334](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18334), was opened to address a `vm-compat` program failure when analyzing `go1.25` binaries. The error relates to an unhandled modification of a register in an r-type instruction during syscall number retrieval.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `cannonKonaPrestate` Documentation for Upgrades
Discussion on [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095) continued regarding the documentation requirement for `cannonKonaPrestate` during upgrades. The latest update indicates that the docs team has received a one-pager, including the need to provide a Kona prestate, and the requirement is now a concern for the U18 upgrade. Previously, it was agreed with devrel to highlight this in Optimism's documentation.
