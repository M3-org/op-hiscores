# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Aug 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on ongoing discussions and progress within existing issues, particularly around `op-proposer` configuration, sync testing, and flashblocks-related alerts. A decision was made to close an issue related to `op-up` support for the challenger.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
**Challenger Support in op-up**
The issue of supporting the challenger in `op-up` was closed today. The decision was made that distributing the challenger within `op-up` for `sysgo` use is likely not worth the effort, and focusing on other backends like Docker, which do not require binary distribution, is a better approach ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17005)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
**op-proposer Failed to create a transaction**
Discussion on this issue continues, with a user confirming that setting `--game-type=1` resolved their problem. This aligns with earlier suggestions about ensuring the correct game type is configured for `op-proposer` ([#13502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/13502)).

**op-sync-tester,op-acceptance-tests: sync test using the sync-tester**
New test case ideas were proposed, including checking every OP Stack Hard Fork transition, validating multiple CLs syncing with a single sync tester, and incorporating user transactions into L2 blocks for sync validation. Items 2 and 3 are being tracked in a separate issue ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16703)).

**load testing flashblocks on devnets**
An update indicated that a report summarizing the load test outcomes, scenarios, and results is in progress ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16756)).

**alert when non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off**
Progress is being made on a related pull request ([#400](https://github.com/flashbots/rollup-boost/pull/400)) in the `flashbots/rollup-boost` repository. Once this lands, an alert will be created ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16867)).

**alert on low peer count health of flashblocks-enabled sequencer**
It was noted that peer count alerting for `op-node` sequencer peering is already in place. The plan is to add `reth`/`op-rbuilder` peer count for this specific alert ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16868)).
