# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Jun 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a significant update to the transaction pool with the addition of periodic filtering. Several long-standing issues were closed, including one related to CI flakiness and another concerning documentation for ERC-20 bridging. A new issue was opened to improve transaction pool interop checks.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Transaction Pool Enhancements
A new feature was introduced to the transaction pool, enabling periodic transaction filtering. This enhancement aims to improve the efficiency and management of transactions within the pool. ([#629](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/629))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### CI/CD and Testing Improvements
An issue tracking CI flakiness was closed, indicating progress in stabilizing the continuous integration pipeline. Discussions highlighted efforts to improve test reporting and reduce flakiness. ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16271)) Additionally, a spike exploring CI SLAs was closed, with the decision not to implement them for now. ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16437))

### Transaction Pool and Interoperability
A long-standing issue concerning interval transaction validity checks in the tx-pool was closed, following the implementation of periodic filtering. ([#494](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/494))

### Documentation and Feature Requests
A documentation suggestion regarding bridging ERC-20 tokens with Viem was closed, as the issue had been addressed by a previous PR. ([#1508](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1508)) A feature request to enable deterministic gas testing by setting a fixed base fee was also closed, with the understanding that adapting tests to query the base fee would be a better approach. ([#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/408))

## NEW ISSUES

### Transaction Pool Optimization
A new issue was opened to address the efficiency of transaction pool interop checks, proposing batch RPC calls to improve performance. ([#633](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/633))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node Goroutine Stuck Issues
The issue [#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16332) continues to be active, with recent comments from users reporting similar problems with `op-node` v1.13.3 experiencing thousands of stuck goroutines, primarily in `select`, `IO wait`, or `yamux` session handlers, leading to sync failures. Users are confirming the persistence of the issue and some have not yet tried v1.13.4.
