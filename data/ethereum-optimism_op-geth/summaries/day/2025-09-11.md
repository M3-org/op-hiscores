# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Sep 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, a new feature was added to bump the Superchain Registry to include the Arena-Z Sepolia Isthmus hardfork. Additionally, several issues related to flashblocks enablement, alerts, and op-conductor deployment were closed, indicating progress in operational stability and monitoring.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Superchain Registry Update
A new feature was introduced to update the Superchain Registry, incorporating the Arena-Z Sepolia Isthmus hardfork. This ensures `op-geth` is aligned with the latest Superchain configurations.
- Bumped Superchain Registry commit to `8ae98b` ([#678](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/678))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Stability
Significant progress was made in deploying and stabilizing flashblocks on mainnet sequencers. This included enabling flashblocks on individual sequencers and then extending the deployment to the remaining sequencers.
- Enabled flashblocks on `prod-mainnet-op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-0` and confirmed stability ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16759))
- Enabled flashblocks on the remaining sequencers on OP Labs infra ([#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16760))
- Enabled flashblocks on `op-opn-geth-f-sequencer-1` mainnet ([#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17317))

### Operational Monitoring and Alerts
Several issues related to monitoring and alerting for sequencer health and flashblocks were addressed and closed, enhancing the robustness of the system.
- Implemented an alert for low peer count health of flashblocks-enabled sequencers ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16868))
- Confirmed existing alerts cover the health of non-flashblocks enabled sequencers ([#17143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17143))
- Released and deployed `op-conductor` with EL P2P health checks ([#17153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17153))

### Documentation and Testing Updates
Documentation for bridging ETH to OP Mainnet was updated, and several outdated smoke tests were closed.
- Updated the tutorial for bridging ETH to OP Mainnet with Viem-supported networks ([#1473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1473))
- Closed outdated smoke tests for `op-challenger`, proofs, `op-dispute-mon`, and `op-proposer` as they are no longer required ([#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/141), [#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/140), [#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/142), [#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/143))

## NEW ISSUES
- **Op-Program Enhancements**: A new issue was opened to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program` to improve performance ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17416)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Contract Upgrade Testing
Issue [#17332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17332) "Add soneium to contract upgrade tests" is active. The latest comment from @MozirDmitriy indicates that a pull request has been opened to address this issue, suggesting progress towards its resolution.

### Kurtosis Reverse Proxy Websockets Support
Issue [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17194) "Implement Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy" is active. @alfonso-op initially closed the issue stating it wouldn't be implemented, but @ajsutton reopened it due to a lingering TODO in the code referencing this feature. @alfonso-op then requested @serpixel to remove the TODO and close the issue, confirming the decision not to implement this feature.
