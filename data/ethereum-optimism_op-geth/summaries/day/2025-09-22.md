# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Sep 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the identification of a configuration bug related to `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` and the closure of an issue concerning the `op-test-sequencer` due to a shift away from Kurtosis.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Deprecation of Kurtosis for `op-test-sequencer`
The issue [#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15265) regarding the addition of `op-test-sequencer` to the devnet environment and Kurtosis was closed. This decision was made because the team is moving away from using Kurtosis.

## NEW ISSUES
### Upstream Configuration Bug Identified
A new issue [#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/685) was opened concerning `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` always using default configurations. This appears to be an upstream configuration bug that has already been fixed in the `go-ethereum` repository and is expected to be resolved with the next upstream merge.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-test-sequencer` and Kurtosis Integration
Issue [#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15265), "op-test-sequencer: add to devnet env and kurtosis," was closed today. The latest comment from janjakubnanista at 2025-09-22T18:25:26Z explicitly states, "Closing since we are moving away from `kurtosis`." This follows earlier discussions, including emhane's comment on 2025-08-11T13:16:17Z highlighting its necessity for reorg tests in the kona-supervisor devstack environment, and ajsutton's re-opening of the issue on 2025-06-02T20:42:52Z due to a todo in the code. teddyknox had previously deprioritized it on 2025-06-02T14:53:47Z pending use-cases for testing versus using the test-sequencer with sysgo.
