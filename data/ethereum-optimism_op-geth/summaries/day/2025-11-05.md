# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Nov 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining network peer interactions and addressing a rare database corruption edge case. A key issue regarding op-batcher's rollup config synchronization was also opened and actively discussed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Network Peer Management
Improvements were made to restrict mempool access exclusively to trusted peers, enhancing network security and control. This change impacts various core Ethereum components and peer-to-peer functionalities. ([#719](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/719))

### Database Stability Enhancements
A fix was implemented to synchronize the ancient store before journaling in the path database, resolving a rare edge case that could lead to history truncation errors and database corruption. ([#718](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/718))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dependency Resolution
A long-standing issue concerning a broken dependency in `op-chain-ops` related to `github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39` was resolved. The fix was implemented in a separate repository. ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16612))

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher Rollup Config Synchronization
Discussion on [#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18178) centered on the `op-batcher`'s current behavior of fetching the rollup config only once at startup, leading to potential desynchronization if the config changes. `sebastianst` highlighted the brittleness of relying on error handling for outdated configs and suggested an alternative: hooking into the active endpoint provider to signal when the active endpoint changes, prompting a rollup config reload. `joshklop` agreed on the brittleness and proposed making the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher to avoid unnecessary concurrency. `sebastianst` further elaborated on this idea, suggesting that for Superchain Registry chains, the batcher could query the chain ID at startup and load the config, only requiring explicit provision for non-SR chains. A potential downside noted was the need for a new batcher release for each SR config change, which is not currently the case.
