# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Nov 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing network stability and data integrity with updates to mempool restrictions and ancient store synchronization. A critical dependency issue was resolved, and a new issue regarding op-batcher's rollup config synchronization was opened for discussion.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Network Stability and Peer Management
- Implemented restrictions on the mempool to only accept transactions from trusted peers, enhancing network security and stability. ([#719](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/719))

### Data Integrity and Database Synchronization
- Synchronized the ancient store before journaling in the path database to prevent potential data corruption issues, addressing a rare edge case. ([#718](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/718))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dependency Resolution
- The `op-chain-ops` broken dependency on `github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39` was resolved. ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16612))

## NEW ISSUES

### Batcher Configuration Synchronization
- A new issue was opened concerning the `op-batcher`'s inability to stay in sync with the `op-node`'s rollup configuration after initial startup. ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18178))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher: stay in sync with op-node rollup config ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18178))
Discussion revolves around the `op-batcher` only fetching the rollup config once at startup, leading to potential desynchronization. Commenters noted the brittleness of relying on error handling for outdated configs and suggested alternative solutions. One proposal involves the active endpoint provider signaling changes to the rollup config, while another suggests making the operator explicitly provide the rollup config to the batcher to avoid unnecessary concurrency.
