# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Jul 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant activity in issue resolution, with several discussions concluding and issues being closed, particularly around flashblocks and builder deployments. A new pull request was opened for code refactoring.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No completed work to report for this period.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/644), was opened to refactor code by using `maps.Copy` for cleaner map handling.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Flashblocks and Builder Deployment Strategy
Discussions concluded on the necessity of NVMe node deployment for `op-rbuilders` and dedicated namespacing for rbuilders. It was decided to skip NVMe nodes for now due to current flashblocks generation and to integrate flashblocks components within the existing sequencer namespace, adding labels for better monitoring and alerting rather than separate namespaces ([#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16689), [#16690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16690)).
### Test Chain Fork Porting
The issue related to porting `TestChainFork` to devstack was closed, as it has been implemented in a related pull request ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/413)).
### Code Duplication in op-batcher
An issue identifying duplicate code in `op-batcher` was closed, with the observation that `checkTxpool` might be redundant ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16677)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened on this day.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Flashblocks on Sunnyside Sequencers
Discussion on [#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16688) indicates that enabling flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers is currently deprioritized. The focus is on achieving stable flashblocks on OP Labs Sepolia infrastructure first. As of August 19th, all Sunnyside sequencers for Sepolia are running with Flashblocks and connected to the websocket proxy, with failover tested on a devnet.
### Txpool: Invalid Interop Tx Conditionally Included
Issue [#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/635) continues to be investigated. A user reported experiencing the behavior where an invalid interop transaction was conditionally included in the mempool during `op-acceptance-tests` CI, leading to flakiness. Despite attempts to reproduce the bug by running tests in parallel and tracing `geth`'s transaction inclusion logic, the issue remains elusive. The core challenge is understanding how an invalid transaction could bypass the ingress filter and be included in the mempool.
