## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Documentation
Discussion continues on documenting the DA Footprint Limit, with a recent comment suggesting that this issue could be tracked alongside the documentation effort for the MinBaseFee feature. The emphasis is on clarifying the risks associated with setting the scalar too high or too low and its interaction with gas limit changes.
