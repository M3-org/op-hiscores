### Acceptance Test Reporting
Discussion on [#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16273) regarding reporting unused acceptance tests concluded with the decision that this issue is no longer relevant. The team has transitioned to primarily using gateless mode for tests, making the original goal of discovering and reporting unused tests obsolete.

### DA Footprint Limit Documentation
The issue [#1742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1742), concerning documentation for the DA Footprint Limit, saw a recent comment suggesting that this issue could be tracked alongside the documentation effort for the MinBaseFee feature ([docs#1710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/issues/1710)). The commenter noted that the topic is "pretty self explanatory."
