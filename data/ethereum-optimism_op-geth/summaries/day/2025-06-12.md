## ACTIVE ISSUES
### CI Flakiness Investigation
Discussion continued on investigating and improving CI flakiness [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16271). A comment on June 12th noted related issues and pull requests in the broader Optimism repository, specifically referencing [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/16378). Previous comments highlighted that most flakiness stems from infrastructure issues rather than acceptance tests themselves, and a list of the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests was provided.

### Incorrect Nonce from eth_getTransactionCount
There was an update on the issue where `eth_getTransactionCount` returns an incorrect nonce [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/623). A user commented on June 12th asking for an update on the resolution of this bug, which causes transactions to get stuck in the mempool.
