# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on maintenance with updates to the Dockerfile and Superchain registry. Discussions continued on interop transaction evaluation and the synchronization issues faced by nodes. A key issue regarding the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades was closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

- **Dependency and Registry Updates**: Minor updates were made to the Dockerfile to refresh `apk` packages and the Superchain registry was updated, ensuring the project uses the latest dependencies and registry information. [#737](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/737), [#736](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/736)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Dockerfile Update**: A pull request [#737](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/737) was opened to update `apk` packages within the Dockerfile.
- **Superchain Registry Update**: A pull request [#736](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/736) was opened to update the Superchain registry.

## CLOSED ISSUES

- **Documentation for Upgrade Requirements**: The issue [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095) concerning the documentation of the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades was closed, indicating the documentation has been addressed.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Node Synchronization Challenges**: Users continue to report issues with nodes failing to synchronize, often encountering "missing trie node" errors. Recent discussions suggest this might be related to incomplete or corrupted state databases, potentially due to unclean shutdowns or insufficient disk IOPS. Users are exploring options like full sync mode or switching to alternative clients like Reth, with one user asking for guidance on where to download OP-GETH or if it's time to switch.

- **Evaluation of Injected Replacement Transactions**: Discussions are ongoing regarding the evaluation and potential rework of injected replacement transactions in the interop protocol. The consensus leans towards simplifying the protocol by eliminating the additional deposit transaction for proofs, with a focus on the Supernode generating necessary data. Concerns were raised about the impact on the proof system and the need for the additional transaction to identify the original block hash, but it was noted that the Supernode could potentially supply this data. The next steps involve assigning someone to architecturally refactor this mechanism and updating the Interop specification. [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18574)

- **Reworking Proofs Action Testing for Supernodes**: A spike issue [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18621) is active to rework proofs action testing to support Supernodes. The discussion revolves around the compatibility of current action testing with the Supernode architecture and the opportunity to simplify the migration of proofs tests. Key questions include how to test the actual Supernode implementation and whether to adapt existing action tests or create a new approach that better fits Supernode testing. The importance of testing the interaction between the challenger and Supernode with a real Supernode implementation was highlighted.

- **File-Relative Paths vs. Project-Relative Paths**: The discussion on issue [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/10202) continues regarding the use of file-relative paths instead of project-relative paths. A recent comment suggests that context-aware remappings could solve compilation issues related to project-relative paths, providing a potential solution to the problem.
