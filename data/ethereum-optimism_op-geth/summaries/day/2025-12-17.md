# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw discussions on existing issues, particularly around node synchronization problems and the architectural considerations for interop transaction handling and proof testing in Supernodes. Two new pull requests were opened, focusing on Dockerfile updates and Superchain registry updates.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No completed work was reported for this day.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Dockerfile Updates**: A new pull request [#737](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/737) was opened to update `apk` packages within the Dockerfile.
- **Superchain Registry Update**: Another pull request [#736](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/736) was initiated to update the Superchain registry.

## CLOSED ISSUES

- **Documentation of Cannon-Kona Prestate Requirement**: Issue [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095), which aimed to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades, was closed as completed.

## NEW ISSUES

No new issues were reported for this day.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **File-Relative Paths vs. Project-Relative Paths**: Issue [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/10202) discusses the preference for file-relative paths over project-relative paths in imports. The latest comment from `manu-qiro` (Dec 17, 2025) indicates that "context aware remappings solved it for me," referencing a previous suggestion by `alexkeating` (Jan 2, 2025) on how to configure remappings for `lib/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/`.

- **Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx**: Issue [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18574) focuses on re-evaluating and reworking the injected replacement transaction mechanism for invalid interop transactions. The latest comment from `ajsutton` (Dec 17, 2025) highlights two downsides of the Supernode merely recording data: lack of consensus-based accuracy checks and potential data unavailability. However, `ajsutton` believes these concerns might lessen with ZK proofs, suggesting that simplifying the protocol by not requiring an additional deposit transaction for proofs might be the best approach. This follows a consensus reached by `rdin777` (Dec 16, 2025) to simplify the protocol by eliminating the additional deposit transaction for proofs and to update the Interop specification accordingly.

- **Node Synchronization Issues**: Issue [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581) addresses problems with node synchronization, specifically "missing trie node" errors. `yaki-1337` (Dec 17, 2025) confirmed using a full node without an archive and no improper shutdowns, and is now considering switching to Reth or seeking guidance on where to download OP-Geth. `rdin777` (Dec 17, 2025) previously suggested that "missing trie node" errors often indicate an incomplete or corrupted state database and asked for clarification on node type, shutdown history, and execution client to help debug.

- **SPIKE: Rework Proofs Action Testing to Support Supernodes**: Issue [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18621) explores reworking proof action testing to better support the Supernode architecture. `ajsutton` (Dec 17, 2025) emphasized that since `op-challenger` gets data from Supernode in production, tests should also access data through the Supernode. While acknowledging the desire for direct data sources to validate Supernode accuracy, `ajsutton` suggests that Supernode-specific tests could handle this. `Inphi` (Dec 17, 2025) agrees that action tests might be overkill for just testing the proof program but sees their value for testing `op-challenger` in interop scenarios, especially given the intrusiveness required to set up test scenarios for various phases of the super STF.
