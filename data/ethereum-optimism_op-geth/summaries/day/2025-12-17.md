## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation of Upgrade Requirements
The issue concerning the documentation of the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades was closed today [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095). This indicates that the necessary documentation has been addressed.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: Evaluate and Rework Injected Replacement Tx
Discussions continued regarding the necessity and implementation of injected replacement transactions for invalid interop transactions [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18574). The latest comments from @Inphi and @ajsutton indicate a growing alignment towards simplifying the protocol by removing the additional replacement transaction, especially considering the context of ZK proofs where it may not provide significant value. @ajsutton highlighted the downsides of relying solely on supernode-recorded data for accuracy and availability in the current system, but noted these concerns might lessen with ZK.

### Node Synchronization Issues
The issue of nodes failing to synchronize, often presenting with "missing trie node" errors, remains active [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581). @yaki-1337 reported deleting everything and asked for guidance on where to download OP-GETH or if switching to Reth is advisable. @rdin777 provided troubleshooting steps, asking for clarification on node type (full/archive), shutdown history, and execution client used, suggesting `--syncmode=full` or checking disk IOPS.

### SPIKE: Rework Proofs Action Testing to Support Supernodes
Discussions on reworking proofs action testing to better support the Supernode architecture are ongoing [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18621). @ajsutton emphasized the importance of testing the interaction between the challenger and Supernode with a "real" Supernode, suggesting that if the Supernode implementation can be tested effectively, `op-program` could then verify chain state. @Inphi acknowledged that action tests might be overkill for just testing the proof program but expressed less certainty for testing `op-challenger` for interop, noting the intrusiveness required for scenario generation.

### Use File-Relative Paths Instead of Project-Relative
The discussion around using file-relative paths versus project-relative paths for imports continued [#10202](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/10202). @manu-qiro confirmed that "context aware remappings" solved the issue for them, thanking @alexkeating for the suggestion. This indicates a potential solution for the problems caused by project-relative paths in various development environments.
