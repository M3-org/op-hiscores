# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Jun 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a minor but important fix in the `core` module, specifically addressing an initialization error in gas calculation. An active issue regarding state dumping also saw a new comment.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Gas Calculation Fixes
A minor adjustment was made to correctly initialize `gasRemaining` with an assignment operator instead of an addition operator, aligning with similar fixes in the upstream Geth client. This ensures accurate gas accounting during state transitions. ([#627](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/627))

### State Dumping Functionality
A user inquired about a solution for dumping all state of addresses, similar to the `alloc` field in `genesis.json`, noting that the `dump` command does not export all addresses. A new comment from `0xWilliamWang` at 2025-06-08T13:56:28Z asked for an update on a solution. ([#390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/390))
