# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Jul 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing transaction pool validation with a new per-transaction gas limit feature and refining transaction re-injection logic. A significant issue regarding interop prestate configuration was also closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Transaction Pool Enhancements
- Introduced a `MaxTxGasLimit` feature to enforce per-transaction gas limits, particularly useful for sequencers in single-sequencer rollups ([#626](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/626)).
- Refactored the transaction pool to move ingress filter checks into `addTxsLocked`, ensuring that re-injected transactions are properly filtered ([#642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/642)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Transaction Pool Filtering Improvement
- Resolved an issue where transactions re-entered the mempool after a reorg without being re-evaluated by ingress filters, ensuring proper filtering on re-injection ([#641](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/641)).

### Interop Prestate Configuration
- Closed an issue concerning the presence of `CrossL2Inbox` and other interop predeploys in the L2 genesis state, concluding that the execution client is not the ideal place for this validation and that the genesis generation tooling adequately mitigates the risk ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15765)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Interop: check EL prestate for pre-interop CrossL2Inbox configuration fault ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15765))
This issue, now closed, discussed the validation of the `CrossL2Inbox` and other interop predeploys in the L2 genesis state. The latest comment from ajsutton (2025-07-10T03:03:24Z) indicates that the issue is being closed because the execution client is not well-suited for this check. It was argued that the risk of incorrect genesis generation has been sufficiently mitigated by improvements in the `op-deployer` tooling, which now automatically determines the inclusion of `CrossL2Inbox` based on the number of chains and interop activation. This suggests that the problem has been addressed at the tooling level rather than within `op-geth` itself.
