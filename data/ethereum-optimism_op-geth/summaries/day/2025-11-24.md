## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Documentation for Docker Image References
A community member, yasnazariel, has expressed interest in working on the issue regarding incorrect Docker image references on the releases page [#1657](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1657). The issue highlights that the documentation currently lists `ethereumoptimism/op-node` and `ethereumoptimism/op-geth`, which may be outdated.

### Environmental Variables Availability
yasnazariel has also offered to address the issue concerning the apparent unavailability of environment variables corresponding to flags for `op-node` and `op-geth` [#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1874). Previously, these variables were documented, but now only flags seem to be available in the documentation.
