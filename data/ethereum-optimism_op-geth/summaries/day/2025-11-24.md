### Documentation Updates for Docker Images and ENV Variables
Two documentation-related issues saw new interest from a community member. Issue [#1657](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1657), concerning incorrect Docker image references on the releases page, received a comment from @yasnazariel expressing interest in working on it. Similarly, @yasnazariel also volunteered to work on issue [#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1874), which addresses the absence of ENV variable descriptions for `op-node` and `op-geth` flags in the documentation.
