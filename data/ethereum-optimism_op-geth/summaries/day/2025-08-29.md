# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Aug 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the introduction of a new feature to implement a minimum base fee and the closure of an issue related to the min-base-fee specification. Discussions continued on an active issue concerning the removal of req-resp p2p sync in op-node, with new insights on alternative unsafe block sync mechanisms.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/666), was opened to introduce a minimum base fee feature.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Min-Base-Fee Specification Finalized
The issue [#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/742), concerning the specification for the minimum base fee, was closed. This indicates the completion of the specification, as noted by its ratification via https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/pull/747.

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Deprecation of Req-Resp P2P Sync in op-node
Discussion continued on [#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/14108), which aims to remove the req-resp p2p sync mechanism in op-node to address existing sync problems. A new comment from tessr provided extensive context and ideas from @emilianobonassi regarding an alternate unsafe block sync mechanism. This proposed alternative is described as cheaper, simpler, and faster for scale-out and recovery compared to req-resp, highlighting issues with UDP, static IP limitations, and race conditions in the current p2p approach. The alternative involves a centralized driver that can plug into multiple block gossiping mechanisms, using Redis for normal syncs and an admin API for injecting blocks on restarts.
