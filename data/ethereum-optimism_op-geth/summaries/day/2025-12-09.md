## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#732](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/732), was opened to address a fix for `eth_simulateV1` after the Jovian fork.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Node Synchronization and Updates
The issue regarding `op-node` v1.16.3 synchronization problems, where the EL node couldn't synchronize, has been resolved by upgrading and resyncing `op-geth` ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18510)).

### Documentation Improvements
The issue concerning the update of the JSON-RPC API documentation has been fixed ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1773)). Additionally, the problem where environment variables were no longer available in the documentation has also been resolved ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1874)).

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Node Synchronization Challenges
Issue [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18510) discussed problems with `op-node` v1.16.3 synchronization. The user J1a-wei initially reported that after upgrading `op-node` to v1.16.3, their `op-stack` deployments (Optimism, Base, Worldchain) could not synchronize. geoknee suggested that the log line was common after an `op-node` restart and requested more detailed logs and metrics, also recommending an upgrade of `op-geth` to v1.101603.5. J1a-wei later confirmed that upgrading and resyncing `op-geth` resolved the issue.
