## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Node Synchronization Challenges
Issue [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18510), concerning an EL node's inability to synchronize after an `op-node` update, was closed today. The latest comment from J1a-wei confirmed that upgrading and resyncing `op-geth` resolved the synchronization problem.
