# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Jul 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing tracing capabilities to include Optimism-specific fee recipient information and refining interop transaction handling within the miner and transaction pool to detect supervisor failsafe states.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Enhanced Tracing for Optimism-Specific Data**: Improvements were made to the tracing functionality to display the `OptimismBaseFeeRecipient` in prestate tracing results, including normal and diff modes, when Optimism is enabled. This provides more comprehensive debugging information for Optimism-specific transactions. ([#407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/407))

*   **Robust Interop Transaction Management**: The system now detects supervisor failsafe states and rejects interop transactions if the failsafe is active. This involves caching the supervisor's failsafe response locally within the backend and integrating this check into the transaction ingress process in the mempool and miner. ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/636))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

*   A new pull request, [#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/643), was opened to fix a p2p issue by using raw string literals for regular expressions.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Resolved Nonce Errors in Execution**: An issue related to nonce errors when approving and executing transactions after a single approval was closed. This problem, which caused `StateOverrideManager` errors due to user-defined nonces being less than current actual nonces, was resolved by a related pull request in `superchain-ops`. ([#1106](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1106))

*   **Progress on ERC20 Bridge Porting**: The task to port `TestERC20Bridge` to devstack was closed, with the porting work completed and referenced in a related pull request. ([#415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/415))

## NEW ISSUES

No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Sync Tester Development and Session Management** ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16452)): Discussions revolved around the design of a `sync-tester` service for mock EL sync testing, particularly focusing on session management. @protolambda suggested handling sessions more uniquely, possibly by attaching information to the context via HTTP middleware, and preferred not to create a `sync_init` RPC. @pcw109550 proposed a flow where the sync tester digests YAML config for multiple chains, users initialize API endpoints via `/chain/{chain_id}` with a `sync_init` RPC returning a UUID session ID, and the sync tester registers new endpoints `/{session_id}` to proxy CL requests.

*   **Consider Making VerifyOPCM a Wrapper Around DeployImplementations for v2** ([#16653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16653)): @maurelian discussed with auditors who felt that the `VerifyOPCM` script provides redundancy and complements `DeployImplementations.s.sol`. They suggested that if either script is modified significantly, the other acts as a check. A potential approach is to re-run `DeployImplementations` within `VerifyOPCM` alongside its other checks.

*   **E2E: Invalid Interop Tx Reinjection Test** ([#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16656)): @pcw109550 outlined a testing strategy using `op-test-sequencer` to force include invalid execution messages. The plan involves checking if the invalid message block is reorged, implicitly verifying that new L2 blocks do not contain invalid interop transactions, and explicitly checking the mempool to ensure the invalid message transaction is absent. A related PR ([#16569](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16569)) was referenced for inspecting the mempool.

*   **Interop: Stress Test Expiry Window** ([#15285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15285)): @pauldowman clarified that the "consolidation step" refers to the final stage in the fault proof program where it validates executing messages after derivation. @mds1 sought clarification on this term. Earlier comments noted that the expiry window reduction to 7 days and microbenchmarks suggest no immediate issues, but a worst-case scenario test on actual interop-enabled chains is still desired.

*   **op-batcher: duplicate code** ([#16677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16677)): @chuwt questioned the necessity of `checkTxpool` in `op-batcher/batcher/driver.go` given that `publishStateToL1` already performs this check. @geoknee acknowledged the observation and welcomed a PR to address the duplication.

*   **Add lint for checking spelling** ([#680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/680)): @JoshdfG expressed interest in taking on the task of adding a `codespell` workflow for spelling checks, referencing a similar workflow in the `reth` repository.
