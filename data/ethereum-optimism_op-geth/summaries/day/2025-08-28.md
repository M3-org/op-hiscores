## NEW ISSUES

### CI/CD Improvements
A new issue was opened to discuss running the monorepo CI suite on `op-geth` PRs to ensure changes are compatible with the broader monorepo ecosystem and prevent regressions [#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/665).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblock Test Enablement
Discussion continued on enabling flashblock tests against persistent devnets [#17248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17248). The latest comment reiterates that the gate for these tests is already in place and the primary task is to ensure its correct functionality.

### Documentation for op-deployer
Discussions are ongoing regarding the documentation for creating an OP Stack Rollup testnet with `op-deployer` [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1530). A recent comment highlights a "rich PR" that overhauls the existing documentation, inviting review. Earlier comments noted a high number of RPC calls when using the permissioned fault-proof system, particularly `eth_call` requests targeting Permissioned Dispute Game contracts, and concerns about the current documentation being mixed between old manual deployment methods and the new `op-deployer` approach. There was also a question about potential issues arising from deploying a chain with permissioned fault proofs if there's a configuration discrepancy.
