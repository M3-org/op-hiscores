# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Oct 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The primary focus today was on refining the Data Availability (DA) footprint implementation, specifically transitioning to storing it in the `blobGasUsed` header field. This change improves how DA costs are tracked within blocks.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### DA Footprint Implementation Refinement
- The method for storing the Data Availability (DA) footprint has been updated to utilize the `blobGasUsed` header field instead of the `gasUsed` field. This change provides a more accurate and dedicated mechanism for tracking DA costs. ([#694](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/694))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### DA Footprint Storage Update
- The issue tracking the change to use `blobGasUsed` for storing the DA footprint has been closed, indicating the successful implementation of this feature. ([#691](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/691))

### Grafana Metric Inquiry
- An issue regarding metrics in Grafana was opened and quickly closed, likely due to it being a general question better suited for Discord. ([#699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/699))

## NEW ISSUES

### Grafana Metrics Information Request
- A new issue was opened requesting information about available metrics in op-geth for display in Grafana, seeking a link or explanation of their meanings. ([#700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/700))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher: prepare for Fusaka ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17472))
The discussion on this issue, concerning the op-batcher's preparation for the Fusaka L1 activation, indicates a plan to reopen the issue. The re-opening aims to cover releasing a new batcher version that includes auto-switching to cell proofs and baking in the mainnet Fusaka activation time via `op-service` and `op-geth`. Previously, manual testing against a Fusaka L1 was outlined.

### op-batcher: ensure full shutdown when "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" ([#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17768))
The latest thinking on this issue suggests maintaining the current detection logic for the "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" error. Instead of introducing new metrics or logs, the focus is on ensuring a full process shutdown when this error occurs. This would allow the batcher to enter a crashloop and automatically recover once the `SetMaxDASize` RPC method becomes available again.
