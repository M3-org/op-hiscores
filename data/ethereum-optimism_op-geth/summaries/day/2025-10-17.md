# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Oct 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The primary focus today was on refining the Data Availability (DA) footprint implementation, specifically transitioning to storing it in the `blobGasUsed` header field. This change improves how DA costs are tracked within blocks.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### DA Footprint Implementation Refinement
- The method for storing the Data Availability (DA) footprint has been updated to utilize the `blobGasUsed` header field instead of the `gasUsed` field. This change provides a more accurate and dedicated mechanism for tracking DA costs. ([#694](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/694))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### DA Footprint Storage Update
- The issue tracking the change to use `blobGasUsed` for storing the DA footprint has been closed, indicating the successful implementation of this feature. ([#691](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/691))

### Grafana Metric Inquiry
- An issue regarding metrics in Grafana was opened and quickly closed, likely due to it being a question better suited for Discord. ([#699](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/699))

## NEW ISSUES

### Grafana Metrics Inquiry
- A new issue was opened requesting information on available metrics in op-geth for display in Grafana, seeking a link or explanation of their meanings. ([#700](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/700))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-batcher: prepare for Fusaka ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17472))
The issue was reopened to cover releasing a new batcher version that includes auto-switching to cell proofs and baking in the mainnet Fusaka activation time via `op-service` / `op-geth`. Previously, manual testing against a Fusaka L1 was outlined.

### op-batcher: ensure full shutdown when "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" ([#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17768))
The latest discussion indicates that the current detection logic for the unavailable `SetMaxDASize` RPC method will be maintained. Instead of introducing new metrics or logs, the focus is on ensuring a complete process shutdown. This will allow the batcher to enter a crashloop and automatically recover once the RPC method becomes available again.
