## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-batcher` Max Frame Size in Generic Mode
Discussion continued on issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17796) regarding the `op-batcher` not limiting max frame size to max input size in generic commitment mode for altDA. The latest comment from `nuke-web3` suggests that the current spec might be outdated and needs to be updated to reflect the recent changes, specifically regarding the `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` for `commitment_type == 0`. Previously, `tessr` noted that the issue was addressed in a pull request, asking if the issue could be closed.
