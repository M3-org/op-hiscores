- [#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16520)

## NEW ISSUES

### Transaction Pool Filtering on Reinjection
A new issue was opened to address the problem of invalid interop transactions not being re-evaluated by filters when re-entered into the mempool after a block reorg.
- [#641](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/641)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes
Discussions continue on understanding and supporting OPCM changes for the Fault Proof creator contract. The latest comment outlines a detailed checklist of tasks, including moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, and addressing TODO comments.
- [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15789)

### RV Audit - Testing Impossible Cases and Hazard Set Construction
The discussion on this issue, related to the RV Audit, saw a new pull request being made for review. The issue highlights concerns about a test that sets a custom `openBlockFn` to return `ErrAwaitReplacement` and the lack of a clear `invalid` signal during Hazard Set construction.
- [#16548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16548)

### Abnormal CPU Usage with Latest `op-geth`
Users are reporting abnormal CPU usage with `op-geth` v1.101511.0. The latest comment provides instructions on how to enable pprof and capture CPU performance data, and an attached profile suggests the issue might be related to index updates, which can take a significant amount of time. Previous comments also noted that the high CPU usage might be temporary during log indexing rebuilds.
- [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/613)

### Runbook v3 Final Review
A new issue was opened to conduct a final review of the v3 fault proof incident runbook before removing its "draft" label. The latest comment indicates that references from other runbooks have been updated to point to V3, and the different runbook versions have been renamed to indicate applicable releases.
