# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Sep 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw no new code contributions, but significant discussion occurred on several active issues, particularly concerning CI/CD improvements, Cannon/Kona integration, and P2P configuration. Two new issues were opened, reporting problems with large genesis files and missing `eth_getLogs` events.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Node Initialization and Database Issues
A new issue was opened regarding a `leveldb panic` when initializing `op-geth` with a large 7GB genesis file, indicating potential stability issues with large datasets during node setup ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/668)).

### RPC Query Inconsistencies
Another new issue reported missing events on `eth_getLogs` calls immediately after `newHeads` and occasional high latency, suggesting potential problems with RPC reliability and event indexing ([#667](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/667)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### CI/CD and Developer Experience Improvements
Discussions continued on improving the UX and testability of the CircleCI configuration ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17184)). @bitwiseguy gathered more information on desired local CI job execution and the friction caused by manual prerequisite setup. @teddyknox highlighted the need for local execution of proofs tests and suggested a tool to dynamically sort Go tests by duration for more efficient local testing and CI job categorization.

### Cannon and Kona Integration
Discussions progressed on supporting Kona and Cannon in OPCM ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17285)) and integrating their standard prestates ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17283)). @ajsutton confirmed the need for OPCM to support deploying the new game type and suggested a format for `standard-prestates.toml` to include `cannon-kona` type prestates.

### P2P Gossip Configuration Bug
An active discussion revolved around a bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values in `op-node/p2p/gossip` ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17308)). @wood-jp explained that this issue caused panics in tests due to invalid `libp2p` configurations (e.g., `Dhi=0` and `Dscore=4`). @ajsutton questioned the approach of making invalid configs work and suggested a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to return a fully valid configuration with sensible defaults, which could then be modified for tests.

### Sync Tester Enhancements
The issue concerning sync tests using the sync-tester ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16703)) was reopened by @pcw109550, stating that "we did not test each HF transition." This indicates a need for more comprehensive testing of hard fork transitions within the sync testing framework.

### Go 1.25 Compatibility for Cannon
Discussion on Cannon's compatibility with Go 1.25 ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17060)) saw an update from @pauldowman noting the release of Go 1.25.1. However, @ajsutton pointed out that this release does not appear to include the MIPS fix, which might still be a concern.
