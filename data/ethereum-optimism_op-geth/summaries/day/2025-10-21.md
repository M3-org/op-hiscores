## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Fusaka Preparation and Prestate Updates**
Discussions continued on [#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/682) regarding the preparation for Fusaka. It was clarified that the Sepolia Fusaka merge is complete, but the Mainnet merge is still pending. Similarly, for [#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1206), the task of updating the absolute prestate has been completed and executed on Sepolia. The question was raised whether to keep the issue open to track the Mainnet task.

**Observability in Sysgo Devnets**
Issue [#17941](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17941) discusses enabling observability and monitoring in sysgo for long-running, in-memory op-stack devnets. A comment suggested this might be a duplicate of an existing issue in the main Optimism repository.

**Mise Installation Error**
Issue [#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17963) reports an Optimism `mise` install error due to a "v" prefix in the version string. A comment clarified that this is an issue with the latest version of `mise` and recommended using the `install_mise.sh` script from the latest `develop` branch of the main Optimism repository, which uses a compatible version of `mise`.
