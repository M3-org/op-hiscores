# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Oct 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on integrating Jovian receipt fields, enhancing transaction pool gossip restrictions, and updating Superchain configurations. Several documentation-related issues were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Jovian Fork Preparation and Receipt Field Population
Work was completed to populate Jovian receipt fields, specifically `daFootprintGasScalar` and `blobGasUsed`, during receipt derivation. This involved moving code into new files to support the new fields. ([#710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/710))

### Transaction Pool Gossip Restriction Proof-of-Concept
A proof-of-concept implementation for `RollupNetrestrictTxPoolGossipFlag` was added, utilizing `NilPool` to restrict transaction pool gossip. ([#713](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/713))

### Superchain Configuration Updates
The Superchain registry reference was updated to incorporate new Jovian timestamps from the `superchain-registry` repository. ([#712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/712))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#714](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/714) Update forkdiff
- [#711](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/711) chore(common): chore: tests using testing.B.Loop

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Jovian Fork Feature Implementation
The issue tracking the addition and population of Jovian receipt fields (`daFootprintGasScalar`, `blobGasUsed`) was closed following the completion of the relevant development work. ([#708](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/708))

### Documentation and Link Fixes
Several issues related to broken internal links and general documentation problems were addressed and closed. This included fixes for specific paths and a broader effort to resolve broken links identified by a linter. ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1789), [#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1797), [#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1802))

### Flashblocks Websocket Timeout Resolution
An issue concerning a 30-second timeout on the Flashblocks websocket URL, attributed to Cloudflare<>GCP interference, was closed after being fixed. ([#17858](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17858))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Celestia Batcher DA Size Fix Investigation
Discussions continue regarding the `op-batcher`'s max frame size limitation in generic commitment mode for alternative DA. A proposed fix from Celestia has been reviewed and deemed good, with a request for them to open a pull request. ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17796), [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17872))
