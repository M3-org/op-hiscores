# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Oct 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on integrating Jovian receipt fields, enhancing transaction pool gossip restrictions, and updating Superchain configurations. Several documentation-related issues were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Jovian Fork Preparation & Receipt Field Population
Work continued on preparing for the Jovian fork, specifically by populating new receipt fields such as `daFootprintGasScalar` and `blobGasUsed` to reflect individual transaction DA footprint. This involved significant code reorganization to accommodate the new fields. ([#710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/710))

### Transaction Pool Gossip Restriction Proof-of-Concept
A proof-of-concept (PoC) was implemented to add `RollupNetrestrictTxPoolGossipFlag` using `NilPool`, aiming to restrict transaction pool gossip. This PoC builds upon existing `op` infrastructure. ([#713](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/713))

### Superchain Configuration Updates
The Superchain registry reference was updated to incorporate new Jovian timestamps, ensuring compatibility with the latest Superchain configurations. ([#712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/712))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#714](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/714) Update forkdiff
- [#711](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/711) chore(common): chore: tests using testing.B.Loop

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Jovian Fork Receipt Field Implementation
The issue tracking the addition and population of Jovian receipt fields (`daFootprintGasScalar`, `blobGasUsed`) was closed, indicating successful implementation. ([#708](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/708))

### Documentation and Internal Link Fixes
Several issues related to documentation were closed, including a general issue on docs ([#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1797)), and a specific issue regarding broken internal links in tutorials ([#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1802)). An internal audit-related issue was also closed. ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1789))

### Flashblocks Websocket Timeout Resolution
An issue concerning a 30-second timeout on the Flashblocks websocket URL, attributed to Cloudflare<>GCP interference, was closed. The fix was implemented in the `k8s` repository. ([#17858](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17858))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Celestia Batcher DA Size Fix Investigation
Discussions continued on investigating and potentially upstreaming a fix for the `op-batcher`'s max frame size limitation in generic commitment mode for alternative DA. A Celestia-developed fix was reviewed and deemed good, with a request for them to open a PR. A PR for this fix has since been opened in the `optimism` repository. ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17796), [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17872))
