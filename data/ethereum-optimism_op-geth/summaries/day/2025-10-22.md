# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating dependencies and Superchain configurations, alongside significant progress in closing out several long-standing issues related to validation processes and Jovian upgrade finalization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Dependency and Superchain Registry Updates**
    *   Updated `c-kzg-4844` to version 2.1.5 ([#702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/702)).
    *   Updated Superchain registry imports to include the `worldchain-sepolia` isthmus activation time ([#704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/704)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/703) `jovian: remove feature toggles` was opened, indicating work on streamlining the Jovian upgrade.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Superchain Validation Process Refinement**
    *   Closed issues related to validating all chains on PRs and running genesis validation checks for frontier chains, shifting towards a report-based approach rather than blocking validations ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/689), [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/696)).
*   **Jovian Upgrade Finalization**
    *   The Jovian upgrade transactions' bytecode and the `daFootprintGasScalar` default value were finalized and updated ([#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/772), [#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/773)).
*   **Developer Tooling and Onboarding**
    *   Closed an issue regarding the ability to use local `op-geth` builds with Kurtosis, as investment in Kurtosis is no longer active ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16975)).
    *   An issue for adding a Sepolia ETH faucet to the Protocol R&D Discord was closed, with account funding now in scope for devnet efforts ([#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/12952)).
*   **Dispute Game and Interopgen Updates**
    *   An issue to update `OPCMStandardValidator` for new dispute game contracts was reopened after initial closure, as tests are still skipped when V2 is enabled ([#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17267)).
    *   An issue to rewire `interopgen` config was closed as "won't fix," as `interopgen` is only used by `op-e2e` and new tests are now acceptance tests ([#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17614)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **[DA Footprint Limit] Investigate why block right after genesis still has 0 gas scalar** ([#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17946))
    *   The issue has been identified as being caused by how the first block's L1 block attributes were populated from the genesis `SystemConfig`, which could have a 0 scalar that was not translated. A fix has been implemented in [#17947](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/17947).
