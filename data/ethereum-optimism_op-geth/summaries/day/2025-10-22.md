# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on updating core dependencies and superchain configurations, alongside significant progress in resolving long-standing issues related to Jovian upgrades and internal tooling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Dependency and Superchain Configuration Updates:**
    *   Updated the `c-kzg-4844` library to version 2.1.5 across all components ([#702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/702)).
    *   Synchronized superchain registry imports to include the `worldchain-sepolia` isthmus activation time ([#704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/704)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/703) "jovian: remove feature toggles", was opened today. Its status and progress are pending review.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Jovian Upgrade Finalization:**
    *   The issue concerning the update of Jovian upgrade transactions' bytecode was closed, indicating finalization with updated specs and `op-node` integration ([#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/772)).
    *   The `daFootprintGasScalar` default value for Jovian was finalized and set to 400 ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/773)).
*   **Internal Tooling and Validation Process Improvements:**
    *   The issue regarding the ability to use local `op-geth` builds with Kurtosis was closed, as investment in Kurtosis is no longer a priority ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16975)).
    *   Issues related to genesis validation checks for frontier chains and validating all chains on PRs were closed, shifting towards a report-based approach rather than blocking validations ([#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/696), [#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/689)).
*   **Developer Experience and Interopgen Configuration:**
    *   The request for a Sepolia ETH faucet was closed, with account funding now in scope for devnet efforts ([#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/12952)).
    *   The issue to rewire `interopgen` config was closed as "won't fix," given its limited use in `op-e2e` and the shift to acceptance tests ([#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17614)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **DA Footprint Limit Investigation:**
    *   Issue [#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17946) is investigating why the block right after genesis still has a 0 gas scalar. The latest comment confirms the issue has been found, caused by how the first block's L1 block attributes were populated from the genesis SystemConfig, and a fix is in progress via PR #17947.
*   **OPCMStandardValidator Update:**
    *   Issue [#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17267) concerns updating `OPCMStandardValidator` to handle new dispute game contracts. The issue was initially closed but has been reopened because tests are still skipped when V2 is enabled, indicating further work is needed despite previous PRs.
