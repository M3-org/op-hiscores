# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Jun 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity focused on ongoing discussions and investigations into existing issues, particularly concerning `op-supervisor` behavior during resets and CPU usage spikes in `op-geth`. No new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring were completed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No completed work to report for this date.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened on this date.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed on this date.

## NEW ISSUES

### Dependency Issues
*   A new issue was opened regarding a broken dependency, `github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39`, in `op-chain-ops` [#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16612). The discussion notes that `github.com/cosmos/go-bip39` is a fork, but its version is older than the one used by Optimism.

### Supervisor Event Spikes
*   An investigation was initiated into spikes of `local-derived` and `local-unsafe-received` events in `op-supervisor` [#16603](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16603). Initial speculation points towards a potential `ChainsDB` or `GlobalSyncExec` deadlock.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Abnormal CPU Usage with op-geth
Discussion continued on the abnormal CPU usage observed with `op-geth` v1.101511.0 [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/613). A user requested command-line arguments for `pprof` to diagnose the issue, which were provided. It was suggested that the high CPU usage might be temporary due to log indexing rebuilding after backporting go-ethereum v1.15.11. Another user noted that the issue persists even after index upgrade, suggesting a potential goroutine infinite loop.

### op-supervisor: Improve reset unsafe target
Comments on this issue indicate that partial implementation has been done via a pull request, specifically addressing the supervisor's responsibility for providing correct reset targets [#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16314). However, it was noted that the current implementation lacks handling for pre- and post-Interop differences and that the supervisor doesn't have the logs DB pre-Interop.

### op-supervisor: Improve L1 origin validity handling during resets
Discussion highlighted that a L1 origin verifier method now exists at the supervisor side, used for detecting the validity of L1 origin for local unsafe heads [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16315). However, this method and logic are not yet extended to safe heads, which is necessary to fully address the issue's goal of checking L1 origin validity for reset targets.

### op-supervisor: Improve reorg during reset behavior
The current status after a recent pull request was discussed, noting that correct local unsafe heads are now detected with L1 origin checks at the supervisor side before sending `interop_reset` requests to the op-node [#16321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16321). However, L1 origin validity for other safety levels is not yet checked, which is tracked in a related issue.
