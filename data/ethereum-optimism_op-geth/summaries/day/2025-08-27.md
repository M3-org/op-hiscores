## CLOSED ISSUES

**Kurtosis Flashblocks Support Deprioritized**
The issue to add support for flashblocks in Kurtosis was closed, with the decision to deprioritize its implementation at this time. While tests were largely implemented, the task will not be pursued further. ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16514))

## NEW ISSUES

**Gas Cost Discrepancies**
A new issue was opened to investigate a gap observed between different kinds of gas costs when using `debug_traceCall`, specifically noting a difference between "Gross Gas Cost" and "Net Gas Cost" (trace.gasUsed). ([#664](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/664))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Forge Deployer Migration Progress**
Discussions continued on several issues related to the "Forge Deployer" migration. Community member tooshiNoko expressed interest in taking on multiple tasks, including creating a CLI wrapper around the Forge binary ([#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17214)), converting `DeploySuperchain` ([#17215](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17215)), `DeployImplementations` ([#17216](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17216)), `DeployOPChain` ([#17217](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17217)), and contract verification logic ([#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17218)) to use Forge. tooshiNoko also synced with @bitwiseguy on the overall tracking issue ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17213)) to avoid overlapping work, indicating active community engagement in this migration effort.
