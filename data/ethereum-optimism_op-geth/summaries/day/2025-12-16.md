## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **L2 Node Synchronization Challenges**
  Discussions on [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581) continued regarding issues with node synchronization. The latest comment from @yaki-1337 inquired about where to download snapshots with the latest blocks, following previous advice to provide more detailed configuration and logs for diagnosis.

- **Interop Transaction Evaluation and Rework**
  The conversation around evaluating and reworking injected replacement transactions in [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18574) saw further input. @rdin777 summarized the consensus to simplify the protocol by eliminating additional deposit transactions for proofs. The next steps involve assigning someone for architectural refactoring and updating the Interop specification before coding.

- **Kona-SP1 Optimization for ZK Proofs**
  Issue [#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18533) concerning the offloading of expensive operations to the host for Kona-SP1 optimization received a new comment from @lnphi, acknowledging a notification and a humorous observation about similar usernames. This follows a detailed inquiry from @rdin777 about the progress in identifying all areas requiring offloading for keccak and sha2, and whether other cryptographic operations might need similar treatment.
