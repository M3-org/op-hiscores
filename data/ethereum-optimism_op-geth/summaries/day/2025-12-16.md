## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Kona-SP1 Optimization for ZK Proofs** ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18533)): Discussion continued regarding offloading expensive operations like keccak and sha2 to the host for performance in the kona-sp1 program. A user expressed concern about a notification in Cyrillic, which turned out to be a username similarity. The core discussion revolves around identifying all code areas where these operations occur outside the EVM and if other cryptographic or computationally expensive operations might require a similar approach.

- **Interop Transaction Evaluation and Rework** ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18574)): The conversation focused on simplifying the protocol by eliminating the need for an additional deposit transaction for proofs when a block contains an invalid interop transaction. There's a consensus that the Supernode should be able to generate the necessary data for proofs, making the extra deposit transaction unnecessary. The next steps involve assigning someone to architecturally refactor this mechanism and updating the Interop specification before coding. Ajsutton highlighted potential downsides of the super node just recording data, such as lack of consensus checks and data availability issues, but noted these might be less concerning with ZK proofs.

- **Node Synchronization Issues** ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581)): A user reported synchronization problems with their node, specifically "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. They inquired about downloading snapshots for OP-GETH. The maintainer requested more information about the user's client configuration (L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client), full logs, and client flags to diagnose the issue. The user confirmed they are using a full node without an archive and OP-GETH, and that there were no improper shutdowns. They also asked if it's time to switch to Reth.
