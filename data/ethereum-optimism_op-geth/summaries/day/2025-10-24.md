# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Daily Update (Oct 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing block data metrics and updating Superchain configurations. Key updates include adding gauge metrics for block and blob gas usage, and incorporating the Jovian activation timestamp into Superchain imports.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Block Data Metrics
New gauge metrics have been introduced to track block gas used and blob gas used, providing better insight into the data footprint per block. This enhancement is designed to be compatible with running as an L1 node. ([#705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/705))

### Superchain Configuration Updates
The Superchain registry import has been updated to include the Jovian hardfork activation timestamp for all chains that follow the standard Superchain hardfork times. ([#707](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/707))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#706](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/706), has been opened to add a `RollupNetrestrictTxPoolGossipFlag` to `eth` and `cmd`.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### DA Footprint Limit Implementation
The issue related to the complete implementation of the DA Footprint Limit has been closed. This was considered completed following the merge of a related spec derivation in the `optimism` repository. ([#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17551))
