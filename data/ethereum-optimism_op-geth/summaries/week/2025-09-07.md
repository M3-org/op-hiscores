# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant progress in operational stability and a focus on Superchain alignment. Key achievements include the successful rollout and stabilization of flashblocks across mainnet sequencers, accompanied by enhanced monitoring and alerting. The Superchain Registry was updated to incorporate the Arena-Z Sepolia Isthmus hardfork, ensuring `op-geth` remains current with network upgrades. While numerous legacy and performance-related issues were resolved, a new critical issue emerged concerning receipt decoding errors during full sync, which will require immediate attention.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development work focused on enhancing Superchain compatibility and tooling robustness.

- **Superchain Configuration & Syncing:** To align with network evolution, the Superchain Registry was updated to commit `8ae98b`, which includes the Arena-Z Sepolia Isthmus hardfork configuration ([#678](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/678)). In parallel, the `sync-superchain.sh` script was made more resilient by preventing errors when certain genesis files are absent during testing ([#673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/673)).

- **Core Feature Proposals:** A new pull request was opened to introduce logging for Data Availability (DA) usage estimates, aiming to provide better visibility into this core function ([#674](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/674)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a substantial cleanup of old issues and the identification of a new critical bug.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks & Sequencer Stability:** A major effort concluded with the successful enablement of flashblocks on all OP Labs mainnet sequencers, marking a significant operational milestone ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16759), [#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16760), [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17317)). This was supported by deploying `op-conductor` with new health checks ([#17153](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17153)) and implementing new alerts for sequencer peer counts ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16868)).
    - **Performance & Node Operation:** An issue causing a panic during initialization with large genesis files was resolved by clarifying the correct configuration, which involves using the `stateHash` for snap-syncing rather than a large `alloc` blob ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/668)). A user-reported issue on abnormal CPU usage was also closed after it was determined to be temporary during log indexing ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/613)).
    - **Development & Testing Cleanup:** A number of outdated issues were closed, including obsolete smoke tests ([#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/140), [#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/141), [#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/142), [#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/143)), a task to port tests for the already-shipped Isthmus hardfork ([#168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/168)), and an improvement for a devnet spinup script ([#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/346)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Critical Sync Error:** A new high-priority issue was opened reporting that `op-geth` v1.101602.0 crashes with a "Failed to decode RLP receipts" error during a full sync of op-mainnet, potentially blocking new node setups ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/679)).
    - **Performance Enhancement Proposal:** A new issue proposes adding a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program` to improve performance ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17416)).
    - **Tooling Discussions:** Active discussion continues on improving the Kurtosis testing environment, specifically around enabling the use of local `op-geth` builds ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16975)). A decision was also finalized not to implement websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy, and the related issue was closed after a brief reopening to remove a lingering TODO from the codebase ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17194)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the coordinated effort to close numerous operational and testing-related issues, particularly the multi-issue push to deploy and monitor flashblocks. Discussions around the Kurtosis tooling ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16975), [#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17194)) show active decision-making and collaboration between team members on development infrastructure. Additionally, administrative tracking was initiated with a new issue to document funded builder addresses, indicating a focus on transparency within the ecosystem ([#762](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/762)).
