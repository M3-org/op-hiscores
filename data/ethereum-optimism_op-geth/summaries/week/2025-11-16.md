# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on maintaining alignment with upstream `go-ethereum` and significant backlog grooming. The key achievement was the successful merge of `go-ethereum v1.16.4`, ensuring `op-geth` benefits from the latest core developments. Concurrently, a substantial number of older issues were closed, addressing topics from Engine API specifications and test flakiness to node stability. This dual focus on integration and maintenance reflects a commitment to both future-proofing the codebase and improving its current stability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The primary development was the integration of upstream changes from `go-ethereum`.

- **Upstream Geth Integration:** A major merge of `go-ethereum v1.16.4` was completed ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/689)), updating core components like `accounts/usbwallet`, `cmd/evm`, and `cmd/keeper`. This effort keeps `op-geth` in sync with its L1 counterpart. Work immediately began on the next version, with a new pull request opened to merge `go-ethereum v1.16.5` ([#726](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/726)).
- **New Work Initiated:** A pull request was opened to introduce changes related to `basefee` and add debugging logs ([#725](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/725)), signaling ongoing work in fee management and observability.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The week saw a major effort in issue triage and resolution, with no new issues being opened.

- **Closed Issues:** A large volume of issues were closed, cleaning up the project backlog.
    - **Engine API & Interop Transactions:** Several issues were resolved to better align with Engine API specifications and improve interop transaction handling, including error returns ([#596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/596)), dropping transactions from the mempool ([#618](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/618)), and preventing invalid transactions in the txpool ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/635)).
    - **Node Stability & Test Flakiness:** Long-standing issues concerning state DB corruption ([#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/549)) and stuck goroutines ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16332)) were closed due to age. Flaky tests `TestChannelManager_Memory` ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17966)) and `TestMissingBatchE2E` ([#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18138)) were also addressed and closed.
    - **Feature Re-evaluation & Deprecation:** Several issues were closed after re-evaluating their relevance. The decision was made to observe the `min-base-fee` feature in production rather than conduct more simulations ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16958)). Other issues related to deprecated tooling ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15817]) and unneeded test parallelization ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17525)) were also closed.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this week.
    - Investigation continues into the flaky `TestBreakTimestampInvariant` ([#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18137)), with recent failures being shared for analysis.
    - Progress was made on documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095)). A one-pager has been delivered to the documentation team, marking a key step in preparing for the upcoming U18 upgrade.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the coordinated effort to groom the issue backlog, with numerous stale or resolved issues being formally closed. The ongoing discussion around documenting the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095)) highlights active collaboration between the core development and documentation teams to prepare for future network upgrades. Furthermore, the consistent process of merging upstream `go-ethereum` versions demonstrates a disciplined approach to maintaining alignment with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.
