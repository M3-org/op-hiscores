# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by a focus on stability and preparation for future network upgrades. A critical bug causing sync crashes on op-mainnet was resolved, significantly improving node reliability. The team completed essential load testing and analysis for flashblocks and the DA Footprint Limit, closing out major workstreams. Concurrently, development progressed on upcoming hardforks, with feature toggles introduced for the Jovian release and planning initiated for the Fusaka release. A key new discussion emerged around standardizing network upgrade transactions, signaling a forward-looking effort to enhance protocol robustness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on critical fixes, hardfork preparations, and routine maintenance to keep `op-geth` aligned with the broader ecosystem.

- **Critical Sync Bug Fix:** A significant bug causing `op-geth` to crash during snap sync due to an RLP decoding failure in deposit receipt correction was fixed in [#680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/680). This fix, which adjusts the handling of storage RLP following an upstream Geth change, is crucial for node stability on op-mainnet.

- **Hardfork and Release Preparation:**
    - To prepare for the Jovian hardfork, feature toggles were introduced to allow for easy removal of features if necessary ([#677](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/677)).
    - The release process was streamlined by removing the approval hold job from the CircleCI workflow, enabling faster deployments ([#683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/683)).

- **Upstream Sync and Registry Updates:**
    - The `superchain-registry` was updated to a newer commit, ensuring alignment with the latest Superchain configurations ([#672](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/672)).
    - A pull request was opened to merge `go-ethereum v1.16.3`, continuing the effort to keep `op-geth` current with its upstream dependency ([#684](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/684)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of several long-standing items and the introduction of important new discussions for future protocol development.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Critical Bug Resolution:** The primary issue resolved was the "Failed to decode RLP receipts" bug ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/679)), which was fixed by the patch in PR [#680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/680).
    - **Testing and Analysis:** Several key analysis tasks were completed and closed, including the load testing for flashblocks on eris-0 ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16756)), the evaluation of partner support criteria for flashblocks ([#16765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16765)), and a threat modeling analysis for the DA Footprint Limit ([#336](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/336)).
    - **Refactoring and Tooling:** An issue to consolidate redundant address structs across different packages was closed after its scope was completed ([#14977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/14977)). An issue for a Forge Deployer CLI wrapper was also closed ([#17214](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17214)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Network Upgrade Convention:** A significant new issue ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/781)) was opened to establish a more robust and collision-resistant convention for network upgrade transactions that deploy new contracts. The discussion includes detailed analysis on using `CREATE2` with a system address and source-hash for enhanced safety.
    - **Fusaka Release Planning:** A new issue ([#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/682)) was created to track the preparation of `op-geth` for the upcoming Fusaka release.
    - **Test Flakiness:** The `TestPreNoInbox` acceptance test continues to exhibit flakiness ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17298)), with a previous fix proving insufficient. This remains an active area of investigation to improve CI stability.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both resolving immediate issues and planning for the future. The resolution of the critical receipt correction bug ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/679)) involved multiple community members and maintainers identifying the problem and confirming the fix. Similarly, the completion of flashblocks testing ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16756), [#16765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16765)) showcased effective coordination to deliver and document results. The most notable example of forward-looking collaboration is the active discussion on establishing a new convention for network upgrade transactions ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/781)), which features detailed technical proposals and analysis from core contributors.
