# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the robustness and observability of the system, particularly around interop transactions. Key progress was made by implementing a failsafe to reject interop transactions during supervisor failures and by improving tracing to expose Optimism-specific fee data. Alongside these targeted improvements, the team undertook a significant housekeeping effort, closing numerous long-standing issues related to sequencer stability, deployment strategies, and dependencies. While progress was steady, a persistent and hard-to-reproduce bug involving the conditional inclusion of invalid interop transactions in the mempool remains a key area of active investigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving interop transaction handling and providing better debugging tools.

- **Enhanced Interop Transaction Resilience:** To improve system stability, the miner and transaction pool were updated to detect supervisor failsafe states. This change ensures that interop transactions are rejected if the failsafe is active, preventing potential issues from propagating through the system ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/636)).

- **Improved Tracing for Optimism Fees:** Prestate tracing functionality was enhanced to display the `OptimismBaseFeeRecipient`. This provides developers with more comprehensive debugging information for Optimism-specific transactions and fee mechanisms ([#407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/407)).

- **Work in Progress:** Several new pull requests were opened, signaling upcoming improvements. These include a proposal to refine fee estimation in the Gas Price Oracle by adding a block size capacity check ([#645](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/645)), along with minor refactoring efforts to improve code quality ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/643), [#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/644)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a significant amount of activity in issue management, with a focus on closing outdated issues and addressing complex, active bugs.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Sequencer Stability & Housekeeping:** A number of historical issues concerning sequencer recovery from window expiration ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/11228]) and temporary halts ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/12240)) were closed as no longer relevant. An issue regarding an outdated NPM dependency was also closed, as the project no longer updates these packages ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/13459)).
    - **Deployment & Testing:** Discussions on flashblocks builder deployment concluded with a decision to integrate components into the existing sequencer namespace rather than creating new infrastructure ([#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16689), [#16690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16690)). Issues for porting `TestERC20Bridge` ([#415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/415]) and `TestChainFork` ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/413]) to devstack were also closed as completed.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Key Challenge:** A primary focus is the investigation into a flaky CI test where an invalid interop transaction is conditionally included in the mempool ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/635)). The bug has proven difficult to reproduce, and efforts are ongoing to understand how the invalid transaction bypasses the ingress filter.
    - **Design & Planning:** Active discussions are underway for the design of a `sync-tester` service for mock EL sync testing ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16452)) and a testing strategy for invalid interop transaction reinjection ([#16656](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16656)).
    - **Strategic Deprioritization:** The team has decided to deprioritize enabling flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers to first ensure stability on OP Labs Sepolia infrastructure ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16688)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in design discussions and issue resolution throughout the week.
- The design for a new `sync-tester` service saw active debate between contributors @protolambda and @pcw109550, who refined the proposed architecture ([#16452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16452)).
- A discussion around the `VerifyOPCM` script involved feedback from auditors, highlighting collaboration beyond the core team ([#16653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16653)).
- Community engagement was also visible as contributor @JoshdfG expressed interest in taking on the task of adding a spelling linter to the project's CI workflow ([#680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/680)).
