# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Jun 29 - 5, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity in `op-geth` centered on essential maintenance and foundational improvements. The most significant development was the initiation of a major update to merge the latest `go-ethereum` v1.16.1 release, ensuring the project stays synchronized with upstream advancements. Concurrently, work began on enhancing miner test reliability, and a long-standing performance issue related to slow block retrieval was successfully closed. Overall, it was a period of stabilization and groundwork rather than new feature development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no major features were completed this week, important work was initiated to maintain the health and reliability of the codebase.

### Upstream Synchronization and Testing
*   Work has begun to merge `go-ethereum` v1.16.1 into the `op-geth` codebase. This crucial update, tracked in PR [#638](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/638), will bring the project current with the latest improvements and features from the upstream repository.
*   A new pull request, [#637](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/637), was opened to improve miner testing by ensuring transactions are added synchronously. This change aims to create more reliable and predictable test outcomes for the mining process.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving a lingering performance problem, with no new issues being reported.

*   **Closed Issues:** A significant, long-standing issue, [#555](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/555), was closed. Opened in March 2025, this issue concerned slow block retrieval via HTTP or WebSocket, and its resolution marks a key improvement in node performance and responsiveness.
*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened this week, and there was no significant activity on existing issues, indicating a period of stability.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Development activity was focused and minimal this week, with no reports of high-discussion pull requests or issues. The work appears to be concentrated on specific maintenance tasks, such as the upstream merge and resolving the performance issue, suggesting a "heads-down" period for the core contributors. No new community contributors or significant collaborative events were noted in the reports.
