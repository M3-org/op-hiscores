# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Sep 21 - 27, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's focus was on maintaining alignment with the upstream `go-ethereum` repository, a critical task for ensuring the stability and security of `op-geth`. A significant merge of `go-ethereum v1.16.3` was completed, and a pull request for `v1.16.4` was promptly opened. Alongside this core maintenance, the team explored a new experimental mint-burn precompile and continued preparations for future network upgrades like Fusaka. Key discussions also centered on improving internal tooling and refactoring Engine API validations for better efficiency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
### Upstream Geth Synchronization
A primary effort this week was updating the core dependency. This ensures `op-geth` benefits from the latest features, optimizations, and security patches from the underlying `go-ethereum` client.
- **Geth v1.16.3 Merged:** A major update was completed by merging `go-ethereum v1.16.3` ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/686)). This foundational change impacted numerous core components, including `accounts/abi`, `core/rawdb`, `common`, and `core/state`.
- **Geth v1.16.4 Proposed:** Following the previous merge, a new pull request was opened to bring the client up to date with `go-ethereum v1.16.4` ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/689)).

### Experimental Features
- **Mint-Burn Precompile:** A new pull request ([#687](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/687)) was opened to introduce an experimental mint-burn precompile, signaling exploration into new protocol capabilities.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
### Closed Issues
- **Deprecation of Kurtosis:** An issue regarding the `op-test-sequencer` and its integration with Kurtosis ([#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15265)) was closed, as the team is moving away from using Kurtosis for its testing environment.
- **Flashblocks on Sunnyside:** The task to enable flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers ([#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16761)) was marked as complete, confirming the successful deployment.

### New & Active Issues
- **Engine API Validation Refactor:** A new issue ([#688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/688)) was opened to address redundant Engine API validation checks in `Miner.prepareWork`. The goal is to deduplicate this logic by consolidating checks into `eth/catalyst/api_optimism.go`.
- **Upstream Configuration Bug:** An upstream bug was identified where `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` always uses default configurations ([#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/685)). A fix is already present in `go-ethereum` and is expected to be incorporated in a future upstream merge.
- **Fusaka Upgrade Preparation:** Discussions continued on preparing the `op-batcher` for the Fusaka L1 activation ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17472)). The focus is on ensuring the batcher can send blob transactions with cell proofs as required by the upgrade.
- **Superchain-Ops Flow Improvements:** Feedback was provided on the `superchain-ops` signing flow ([#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1224)), leading to clarifications on workflow tooling and suggestions for improving documentation and markdown formatting.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's activity highlights strong internal coordination, particularly around the critical task of keeping `op-geth` synchronized with its upstream dependency. The rapid succession of merging `v1.16.3` and proposing `v1.16.4` demonstrates a proactive maintenance posture. Furthermore, ongoing discussions on active issues like the `superchain-ops` flow ([#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1224)) and Fusaka preparations ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17472)) show a collaborative effort to refine internal processes and prepare for future network milestones.
