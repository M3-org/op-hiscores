# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts focused on enhancing the project's infrastructure and refining core components. A significant step was taken to improve the build and release process with the introduction of a new GitHub Actions workflow for building and attesting `op-geth`. Work also began on strengthening data validation within the downloader component. On the testing front, a key milestone was reached with the successful integration of Jovian action tests into Kona's CI. Meanwhile, active discussions continued around optimizing FCU message handling and improving safeguards for batcher updates.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
New work was initiated to bolster the project's continuous integration pipeline and data handling capabilities.

- **CI/CD and Attestation Workflow**
  A new pull request ([#720](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/720)) was opened to introduce a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and attests `op-geth`. This aims to automate and enhance the security and integrity of the client build process.

- **Data Availability Validation**
  To improve data integrity, work has started on validating data availability footprints within the downloader. Pull request [#721](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/721) proposes adding this validation logic, which will help ensure the correctness of data being processed.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  Progress was made in the testing domain with the closure of issue [#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17303). This confirms that Kona now has passing action tests for Jovian running in its CI, marking a successful enhancement of the project's testing infrastructure.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  No new issues were opened, but several active issues saw important discussions:
    - **FCU Message Optimization ([#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15393)):** Discussion continues on reducing the high volume of Fork Choice Updated (FCU) messages generated by the batcher. Contributors noted that `kona-node` has already implemented a fix and that a recently merged PR may help address the problem.
    - **Batcher Update Safeguards ([#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18246)):** The effort to improve safeguards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig gained context, with a contributor linking it to a related issue ([#17490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues/17490)) that may share similar concerns.
    - **Documentation for Prestate Requirement ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095)):** It was confirmed that the devrel team will highlight the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement in the Optimism documentation, particularly for the upcoming U18 upgrade, ensuring developers are aware of this critical detail.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week saw active collaboration on key issues. The discussion around FCU message optimization in [#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15393) involved multiple contributors (`teddyknox`, `clabby`) sharing insights from different parts of the ecosystem, including existing solutions in `kona-node`. Additionally, the update on documentation issue [#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095) demonstrated effective cross-team coordination, with `Inphi` relaying confirmation from the devrel team. This collaborative spirit is crucial for resolving complex technical and documentation challenges.
