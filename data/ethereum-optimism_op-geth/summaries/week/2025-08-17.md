# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on enhancing the stability and maintainability of the `op-geth` client. A critical bug fix was implemented in the engine API to ensure correct execution payload creation. On the operational front, a significant milestone was confirmed with the successful enablement of Flashblocks on all Sunnyside sequencers for Sepolia. While no major new features were introduced, ongoing maintenance and issue triage demonstrated a focus on improving code quality and resolving existing problems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development work focused on bug fixes and code quality improvements.

- **Engine API Bug Fix:** A key pull request ([#662](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/662)) addressed errors and improved checks within the engine API. This fix corrects issues in `beacon/engine` and `eth/catalyst`, ensuring the reliability of execution payload creation.
- **Code Readability:** To improve code maintainability, a new pull request ([#661](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/661)) was opened to standardize inconsistent function names found within comments.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved closing out operational and testing issues while making progress on older, active discussions. No new issues were opened.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Enabled:** Issue [#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16688) was closed, confirming that all Sunnyside sequencers are now running with Flashblocks enabled and connected to the websocket proxy, with failover successfully tested.
    - **Test Log Visibility:** An issue regarding missing test logs ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17151)) was resolved after the logs were located. This has prompted a related effort to improve the test logging system.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - Discussion continued on an issue regarding missing content types in RPC responses ([#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/389)), with a community member inquiring about contributing a fix.
    - An issue concerning outdated audit content ([#1673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1673)) received a comment requesting clarification, indicating it is being actively triaged but requires more specific information to proceed.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active management of issues. The discussion on issue [#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/389) highlighted community interest in contributing to the project. Additionally, the resolution of the test log issue ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17151)) pointed to a cross-repository effort to improve testing infrastructure, demonstrating coordination within the broader Optimism ecosystem.
