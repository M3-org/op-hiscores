# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Jun 1 - 7, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the Superchain's configuration and improving the robustness of the `op-supervisor`. Key progress was made by updating the Superchain registry with new rehearsal configurations, which also surfaced a new unmarshaling bug. Important discussions are underway regarding the supervisor's role in fault proofs and its L1 origin handling during resets, highlighting a focus on protocol security and interoperability. Additionally, a fix was merged for acceptance tests that were previously blocked, and a new precompile was proposed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on configuration management and laying the groundwork for future enhancements.

- **Superchain Configuration Updates:** The Superchain registry was updated to incorporate the latest `rehearsal-0-bn` configurations. During this process, an issue was identified with unmarshaling the `op_contracts_manager_addr` field from the `superchain.toml` file, which is now being tracked ([#625](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/625)).

- **New Precompile Proposal:** A new pull request ([#628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/628)) was opened to introduce a "transfer only" precompile. The proposal is currently pending review.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving test suite failures and opening new discussions on critical supervisor logic.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Acceptance Test Fixes:** Issue [#16187](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16187) was closed, fixing the `TestUnsafeChainKnownToL2CL` and `TestUnsafeChainUnknownToL2CL` tests. These tests were previously skipped due to a dependency on supervisor multi-node support, and their resolution unblocks further testing in this area.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Supervisor L1 Origin Handling:** A new critical issue ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16315)) was opened concerning the `op-supervisor`. The supervisor's reset logic currently does not verify the canonical L1 origin of a target block, which could lead to inconsistencies. The proposed solution involves adding a verification step and walking back the safe chain if necessary to find a valid L1 origin.
  - **Fault Proofs for Non-Genesis Interop:** A significant discussion continued in [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16166) about enabling fault proofs for chains with non-genesis interop upgrades. The debate centers on whether the `op-challenger` or the `op-supervisor` should be responsible for aggregating data from multiple rollup nodes, a decision with architectural implications for the fault-proof system.
  - **Incorrect Nonce Bug:** The issue of `eth_getTransactionCount` returning an incorrect nonce for pending transactions ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/623)) remains active and is causing transactions to get stuck in the mempool.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development activity this week showcased active collaboration on complex architectural challenges. The discussion on issue [#16166](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16166) between contributors `sebastianst` and `ajsutton` exemplifies the detailed technical debate required to refine the fault-proof mechanism. The engagement across various issues from contributors like `mukul3097` and `ntrzr`, along with new contributions like the precompile PR from `Karlb`, points to a healthy and engaged developer community.
