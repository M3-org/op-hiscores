# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
After a quiet start to the period, development activity ramped up with a clear focus on enhancing network configurability. The primary theme was the introduction of new controls over gas mechanics, laying the groundwork for more flexible fee structures. Work began on implementing a configurable minimum base fee and configurable data gas, initiated through two new feature pull requests and several corresponding issues to track the detailed implementation requirements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no major features were completed, significant foundational work was started on configurable gas parameters. This effort aims to provide chain operators with more granular control over network fees.

- **Configurable Gas Parameters Initiated:**
  - A new pull request ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/648)) was opened to introduce a configurable minimum base fee.
  - A second feature PR ([#653](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/653)) was created to implement configurable data gas per token.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this period was centered on planning and tracking the new gas configuration features.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - A single issue, [#647](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/647), was opened and immediately closed. It contained a feature request template.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - Two new issues were created to support the `min-base-fee` implementation:
    - [#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/649) tracks the work needed to add `minBaseFee` to the block header's `extraData` field.
    - [#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/650) details the extension of `PayloadAttributesV3` to include the new `minBaseFee` field.
  - The main tracking issue for the Min Base Fee feature, [#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16807), saw an update from `wlawt` noting related in-progress work in the `op-alloy` ([#580](https://github.com/alloy-rs/op-alloy/pull/580)) and `optimism` ([#16852](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16852)) repositories.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development activity, though concentrated over a short period, demonstrated strong coordination. The creation of specific implementation issues ([#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/649), [#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/650)) in tandem with the main feature pull request ([#648](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/648)) indicates a well-planned approach. Furthermore, activity on the tracking issue [#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16807) highlights cross-repository collaboration to ensure alignment across the broader Optimism ecosystem.
