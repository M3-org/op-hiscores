# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Nov 30 - 6, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on planning and protocol development rather than merged code. A key strategic decision was made to utilize `op-challenger` for ZK game challenging, resolving a significant spike issue. Concurrently, work on protocol updates has begun with a new pull request, and active discussions are underway to port the `SuperchainConfig` type, ensuring alignment with the broader Superchain specification.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
While no pull requests were merged this week, new work was initiated on protocol updates. A new pull request, [#730](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/730), was opened to address "Sbcp period protocol2," signaling ongoing efforts to evolve the core protocol.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
**Closed Issues:**
- **ZK Game Challenging Strategy Finalized:** A major decision was reached with the closure of spike issue [#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18322). The team has decided to proceed with using `op-challenger` to support challenging ZK games, providing a clear path forward for this functionality.

**New & Active Issues:**
- No new issues were opened this week.
- **`SuperchainConfig` Porting:** Discussion continued on issue [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/741), which tracks the effort to port the `SuperchainConfig` type from the `superchain-registry`. A related pull request ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/867)) is being refined based on feedback to ensure the type definition notation in the specification is language-agnostic and consistent with existing examples.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active discussion around the `SuperchainConfig` specification. The exchange between @Himess and @emhane on issue [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/741) highlights the community's focus on maintaining high-quality, language-neutral specifications, ensuring clarity and consistency across the ecosystem.
