# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on strengthening the core protocol through critical bug fixes and advancing new gas mechanic implementations. Significant progress was made on the Data Availability (DA) footprint limit, with the completion of testing and specification updates. Key fixes were merged for OP Legacy header verification to ensure proper snap-sync and for operator fee calculations. Meanwhile, active discussions continued around the complexities of the dispute monitor and dispute game, highlighting these as key areas for future development. The week also saw the resolution of several Flashblocks stability issues and the emergence of a new operational challenge related to sequencer startup.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on protocol correctness, maintenance, and the implementation of new gas-related features.

- **Consensus and Rollup Cost Fixes:**
  - A critical bug in header verification was fixed to correctly dispatch to OP legacy pseudo consensus only for OP legacy headers, ensuring proper snap-sync functionality for op-mainnet and op-sepolia ([#697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/697)).
  - The operator fee calculation was rewritten to address an issue in rollup cost computation ([#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/696)).

- **Data Availability and Gas Mechanics:**
  - Foundational work was done to implement a calldata footprint block limit spike, exploring multidimensional gas metering concepts ([#655](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/655)).
  - The DA footprint gas scalar was made configurable to align with broader monorepo updates ([#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/675)).

- **Maintenance and Performance:**
  - The `op-geth` version was bumped to `v1.101603.1` to stay current with upstream Geth ([#695](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/695)).
  - A new pull request was opened proposing the use of a read lock for `Content`, `Pending`, and `ToJournal` methods to potentially improve performance ([#698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/698)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the closure of tasks related to data availability and Flashblocks, while discussions on the dispute system and a new sequencer issue gained prominence.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Data Availability Footprint:** A cluster of issues related to the DA footprint limit was closed, marking significant progress. This included updating specifications to use the `blobBaseFee` header field ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/792)), and completing both acceptance tests ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17278)) and unit tests ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17395)).
  - **Flashblocks Stability:** Issues related to Flashblocks were resolved, including a fix for losing blocks when forwarding to RPC nodes ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17856)) and the completion of coordination efforts with RPC providers for a new node ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17857)).
  - **Sepolia Sequencer:** An issue regarding sequencer adjustments on Sepolia was closed ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17683)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Dispute System:** The dispute system remains a key area of active development. Discussion on `op-dispute-mon`'s handling of out-of-sync nodes ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17814)) centered on finding a reliable indicator of a node's sync state. The issue for the v2 dispute game implementation ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17257)) was reopened due to a remaining TODO, indicating the work is not yet complete.
  - **Sequencer Health:** A new issue was opened concerning `op-conductor` failing to start a sequencer with a "no unsafe head" error ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17899)), representing a potential blocker for operators.
  - **Contribution Coordination:** A discussion on replica-healthcheck monitoring ([#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17686)) was clarified as being blocked and intended for the infrastructure team, highlighting the importance of coordinating contributions.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The week's activity demonstrated healthy collaboration and clear communication within the project. The discussion on the replica-healthcheck issue ([#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17686)) served as a public example of maintainers guiding a contributor, clarifying that the work was blocked and suggesting future contributions be discussed first. This helps align community efforts with project priorities. Furthermore, the detailed technical debate on handling out-of-sync nodes in the dispute monitor ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17814)) showcases deep collaboration on complex protocol design challenges.
