# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing data availability mechanisms and bolstering protocol stability. Significant progress was made on the Data Availability (DA) footprint limit, with the completion of unit and acceptance tests, alongside updates to the core specifications. The team also merged critical bug fixes for legacy header verification and operator fee calculations. A new sequencer startup failure was reported, presenting a potential operational challenge, while active discussions continued around improving the dispute monitor's sync handling and finalizing the v2 dispute game implementation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on core protocol enhancements, bug fixes, and routine maintenance.

- **Data Availability & Gas Metering:** A major focus was on advancing the DA footprint limit feature.
    - The specification was updated to use the `blobBaseFee` header field for the new gas dimension ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/792)).
    - Work progressed on implementing a calldata footprint block limit spike ([#655](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/655)) and making the DA footprint gas scalar configurable ([#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/675)).
    - Crucially, both acceptance tests ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17278)) and unit tests ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17395)) for the DA footprint limit were completed.

- **Bug Fixes & Stability:** Several important fixes were implemented to improve the reliability of the client.
    - A bug in OP Legacy header verification was resolved to ensure proper dispatching ([#697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/697)).
    - A fix for the operator fee calculation was merged ([#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/696)).

- **Maintenance & Performance:**
    - A pull request was opened to update `op-geth` to the latest upstream version `v1.101603.1` ([#695](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/695)).
    - A new proposal aims to improve concurrency by using a read lock for `Content`, `Pending`, and `ToJournal` methods ([#698](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/698)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of several issues related to testing and infrastructure, while new discussions pointed to future areas of focus.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **DA Footprint Limit:** A cluster of issues related to the DA footprint limit were closed, marking the completion of specification updates ([#792](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/792)) and testing phases ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17278), [#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17395)).
    - **Flashblocks:** Issues concerning Flashblocks stability ([#17856](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17856)) and coordination with RPC providers ([#17857](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17857)) were resolved.
    - **Infrastructure:** A Sepolia sequencer was successfully demoted/removed to optimize the testnet infrastructure ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17683)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Sequencer Failure:** A new high-priority issue was reported where `op-conductor` fails to start a sequencer with a "no unsafe head" error, potentially blocking sequencer operations ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17899)).
    - **Dispute System:** The issue for implementing the v2 dispute game ([#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17257)) was reopened due to a remaining TODO, indicating work is still ongoing. Separately, discussion continues on how the `op-dispute-mon` should handle out-of-sync nodes ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17814)).
    - **Technical Discussion:** A debate is ongoing regarding the necessity of saturating math in the `operatorFee` getter, with analysis suggesting it may not be required ([#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17888)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted constructive interaction between the core team and the wider community. In issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17686), a community member submitted a pull request for replica-healthcheck monitoring. Although the PR was closed because the work is currently blocked and assigned to the infrastructure team, the exchange provided a clear example of maintainers guiding contributors on process, suggesting future contributions be discussed for assignment first. Internally, the reopening of issue [#17257](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17257) demonstrates diligent code review and tracking of outstanding tasks.
