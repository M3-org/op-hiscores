# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a dual focus on finalizing the Jovian hard fork and addressing critical node synchronization issues. Development efforts locked in the scope for Jovian by removing feature toggles and enhancing tests for new precompile limits. However, this progress was met with a significant operational challenge as a new, widespread synchronization failure emerged, affecting multiple chains in the Superchain ecosystem. The team also resolved several documentation and sync-related issues, demonstrating ongoing maintenance and community support.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on preparing for and responding to the Jovian hard fork.

- **Jovian Hard Fork Finalization:** The project made significant strides toward solidifying the Jovian upgrade. The scope was officially locked by removing related feature toggles from the codebase ([#703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/703)). To ensure the stability of the new changes, additional tests and comments were added to validate the updated precompile input size limits ([#731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/731)).
- **Post-Jovian Bug Fix:** Following the recent changes, a new pull request ([#732](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/732)) was opened to address a bug in the `eth_simulateV1` RPC method, highlighting the iterative process of stabilizing a major fork.
- **New Initialization Work:** A new pull request titled "init" ([#733](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/733)) was opened, though its specific purpose and progress are still pending review.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was dominated by node synchronization problems, ranging from resolved individual cases to a new, critical-level incident.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Node Synchronization:** An issue where an `op-node` failed to synchronize was resolved after the user upgraded and resynced their `op-geth` client, as recommended in the issue discussion ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18510)).
    - **Documentation:** Two documentation-related issues were closed, restoring the availability of environment variables in the docs ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1874)) and updating the JSON-RPC API documentation ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1773)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Critical Sync Failures:** A high-priority issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581)) was reported concerning widespread node synchronization failures. Users across multiple chains, including Base, Optimism, and Unichain, are encountering "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors, particularly when syncing from snapshots. This is a potential blocker for node operators, and maintainers are actively gathering diagnostic information to investigate.
    - **Ongoing Refactoring:** Discussion continues on removing the `isPectra` flag from the batcher ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18479)), with a contributor expressing interest in taking on the task.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week highlighted a responsive and collaborative dynamic between maintainers and the community. In issue [#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18510), a maintainer provided direct guidance that helped a user resolve their sync problem. The emergence of the critical sync failure in [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581) immediately saw maintainers engaging with users to triage the problem by requesting detailed logs and configurations. Furthermore, the interest shown by a community member to contribute to the refactoring effort in [#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18479) indicates a healthy and engaged contributor base.
