# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was marked by a significant milestone as development work on the Jovian hard fork was finalized, with feature toggles removed and the scope locked. This progress was immediately followed by the emergence of a critical, widespread node synchronization issue affecting multiple Optimism-based chains, including Base and Unichain. While the team resolved isolated sync problems and improved documentation, the primary focus shifted to diagnosing the new "missing trie node" errors that are impacting users across the ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on solidifying the Jovian hard fork and beginning the post-release stabilization process.

- **Jovian Hard Fork Finalization:** The codebase was streamlined as feature toggles for the Jovian hard fork were removed, officially locking its feature set ([#703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/703)). To ensure the stability of this update, new tests and comments were added to validate the new precompile input size limits ([#731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/731)).

- **Post-Jovian Bug Fixes & New Work:** In response to the fork's integration, a new pull request was opened to fix an issue with `eth_simulateV1` ([#732](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/732)). Additionally, a new pull request titled "init" was opened, though its specific purpose is not yet detailed ([#733](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/733)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving older sync and documentation issues while a major new synchronization problem took center stage.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Node Synchronization:** An issue where an EL node failed to sync after an `op-node` update was resolved by upgrading and resyncing `op-geth` ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18510)).
    - **Documentation:** Two issues were closed to improve developer experience: one for updating the JSON-RPC API documentation ([#1773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1773)) and another for making environment variables available in the docs ([#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1874)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Widespread Sync Failures:** A critical new issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581)) emerged, with multiple users on Base, Optimism, and Unichain reporting that nodes running `op-geth v1.101603.5 jovian` are failing to synchronize. Users are encountering "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors, particularly when using public snapshots. This appears to be a significant blocker for node operators.
    - **Planned Refactoring:** Discussion continues on removing the `isPectra` flag from the batcher ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18479)), with a contributor expressing interest in taking on the task.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The new synchronization issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581)) has spurred significant community interaction. Multiple users (@bayardar, @yaki-1337, @tsulhc) quickly reported the problem, shared their configurations, and discussed potential workarounds, such as using `snapsync` instead of public snapshots. This community feedback prompted a maintainer (@rdin777) to request detailed diagnostic logs to help triage the problem, highlighting a responsive collaboration between users and the development team to address a critical live issue.
