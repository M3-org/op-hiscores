# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development was heavily focused on preparing for the upcoming Jovian hard fork. Progress was made on multiple fronts, including the introduction of more realistic precompile limits and the implementation of new Jovian-specific receipt fields. In parallel, the Superchain configuration was updated with new Jovian timestamps, ensuring alignment across the ecosystem. Work also began on enhancing network security with a proof-of-concept for restricting transaction pool gossip.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on feature implementation for the Jovian hard fork and network improvements.

- **Jovian Hard Fork Preparation:**
  - New, more realistic limits for accelerated precompiles were introduced in preparation for the Jovian fork ([#709](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/709)).
  - Following the creation of an issue to track the work ([#708](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/708)), the new Jovian receipt fields `daFootprintGasScalar` and `blobGasUsed` were successfully added and populated during receipt derivation ([#710](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/710)).
  - The Superchain registry reference was updated to incorporate the new Jovian activation timestamps, ensuring network-wide readiness for the fork ([#712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/712)).

- **Transaction Pool Enhancements:**
  - A proof-of-concept was implemented to restrict transaction pool gossip using a `NilPool` approach, controlled by the `RollupNetrestrictTxPoolGossipFlag` ([#713](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/713)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Jovian Feature Implementation:** An issue to add and populate new Jovian receipt fields was opened and swiftly closed upon completion of the work ([#708](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/708)).
  - **Tooling & Infrastructure:** An issue regarding the need for more `op-deployer` end-to-end testing was closed, as recent CLI-level integration tests were deemed sufficient ([#16842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16842)). A separate issue related to a Flashblocks websocket timeout was also resolved and closed ([#17858](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17858)).
  - **Documentation:** A series of issues related to broken internal links within the project's documentation were fixed and closed ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1789), [#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1797), [#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1802)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - The primary active discussion revolves around a fix for the `op-batcher`'s max frame size when using alternative Data Availability layers like Celestia. A proposed fix from the Celestia team has been reviewed positively, and the next step is for them to open a pull request for integration ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17796), [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17872)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The ongoing discussion regarding the `op-batcher`'s frame size limitation highlights active collaboration with external teams. The review of a proposed fix from the Celestia team and the subsequent request for a pull request demonstrates a healthy, collaborative approach to improving support for alternative DA solutions within the OP Stack.
