# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by a significant integration effort, bringing `op-geth` up to date with `go-ethereum v1.16.1`. This foundational work ensures the project stays aligned with upstream developments. Attention was also given to hardening existing features, with ongoing work to improve alerting and testing for flashblocks. A new feature to implement a minimum base fee was introduced, moving from specification to implementation. The week also saw strong community engagement, with a contributor taking the lead on a major migration to the Forge Deployer, and deep technical discussions taking place around the future of `op-node`'s sync mechanism.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This week's development focused on upstream integration and introducing a new fee mechanism.

- **Upstream Geth Integration:** A major merge of `go-ethereum v1.16.1` was completed, updating numerous files across the codebase. This crucial update incorporates the latest improvements and security patches from the upstream Geth project, maintaining compatibility and stability ([#652](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/652)).

- **Minimum Base Fee Feature:** Following the ratification of the specification ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/742)), a new pull request was opened to implement a minimum base fee in `op-geth` ([#666](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/666)). This feature is a key step in evolving the project's fee market.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved strategic decisions on tooling, finalizing specifications, and initiating discussions on future architectural changes and CI improvements.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Tooling & Testing Deprioritization:** Strategic decisions were made to close issues related to adding flashblocks support in Kurtosis ([#16514](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16514)) and supporting the challenger in `op-up` ([#17005](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17005)), focusing development efforts elsewhere.
    - **Operational Cleanup:** Several tracking, postmortem, and logging issues were closed, including tasks related to consensus nonces, event tracing, and improving test log visibility ([#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/13543), [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16874), [#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17007), [#17012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17012), [#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17151)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **New Investigations:** A new issue was opened to investigate gas cost discrepancies observed with `debug_traceCall` ([#664](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/664)). Another new issue proposes running the monorepo CI suite on `op-geth` PRs to prevent cross-repository regressions ([#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/665)).
    - **Sync Mechanism Architecture:** A significant discussion is underway to deprecate the req-resp p2p sync in `op-node` ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/14108)). A detailed alternative for unsafe block sync was proposed, aiming for a simpler, faster, and more robust mechanism for node recovery and scaling.
    - **Flashblocks Hardening:** Active discussions continued around improving flashblocks reliability. This includes creating alerts for sequencer health and peer counts ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16867), [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16868)), preparing a report on load testing results ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16756)), and ensuring test enablement on devnets ([#17248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17248)).
    - **Forge Deployer Migration:** A series of issues related to migrating deployment scripts to use the Forge Deployer saw active discussion and community interest ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17213) - [#17218](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17218)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong community collaboration. Community member **tooshiNoko** showed significant initiative by expressing interest in taking on the entire "Forge Deployer" migration effort, coordinating with maintainers to avoid duplicate work ([#17213](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17213)). This demonstrates a healthy and engaged contributor ecosystem. Additionally, the in-depth technical exchange on issue [#14108] regarding `op-node`'s sync mechanism, with detailed ideas shared between team members, points to a collaborative approach to solving complex architectural challenges.
