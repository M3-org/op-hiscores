# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing Superchain compatibility and performing targeted housekeeping on outstanding issues. A key update was merged to improve stability by skipping the non-standard genesis processing for Celo Mainnet. Concurrently, several issues related to flashblocks enablement and transaction pool cost tracking were closed, clearing the path for more organized future development efforts in these areas.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on refining the node's behavior within the broader Superchain ecosystem.

- **Superchain Configuration Enhancements:** To ensure stability and compatibility, a change was introduced to skip the genesis processing for Celo Mainnet within `op-geth` ([#646](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/646)). This addresses Celo's non-standard genesis block and improves its integration into the Superchain.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving older items and clarifying the path forward for ongoing initiatives. No new issues were opened.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Enablement:** Two issues related to flashblocks were closed to better structure the work. Issue [#16544](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16544) concerning RPC configuration was superseded by a new issue, while [#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16496) for Op-Sepolia enablement was closed in favor of a new milestone.
    - **Transaction Pool:** An issue regarding the periodic update of rollup costs in the transaction pool ([#573](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/573)) was closed, confirming a fix for more accurate cost tracking.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - Discussion on the `op-supervisor` reset target ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16314)) concluded that the actionable work is complete for now. The issue is being closed with the understanding that it can be reopened or a new issue created if further work is identified after upcoming refactoring.
