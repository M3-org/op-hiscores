# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity was centered on critical architectural discussions and planning rather than merged code. Significant conversations took place regarding the simplification of interop transaction handling and the redesign of proof testing to support the Supernode architecture. While no major features were completed, several new pull requests were opened for maintenance, refactoring, and bug fixes. The team also actively engaged with community members on node synchronization issues, highlighting a focus on both future protocol design and current user stability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
While no major pull requests were merged this period, development work was initiated across several areas, focusing on maintenance, bug fixes, and code health.

- **Maintenance and Refactoring:** Work began on improving code maintainability and dependency management. This includes a refactoring effort to remove the `storedReceiptsRLP` struct ([#735](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/735)), an update to `apk` packages in the Dockerfile ([#737](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/737)), and an update to the Superchain registry ([#736](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/736)).
- **Bug Fixes:** A pull request was opened to address a nil pointer bug ([#734](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/734)), contributing to overall system stability.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Discussions this week were dominated by active issues concerning protocol architecture, testing, and node stability.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - A documentation issue ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18095)) was closed, ensuring the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades is now properly documented.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Interop Architecture Debate ([#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18574)):** A significant discussion is underway regarding the handling of injected replacement transactions for proofs. There is a consensus forming to simplify the protocol by removing an additional deposit transaction, though concerns were raised by `ajsutton` about the potential security implications for challengers. The next steps involve architectural refactoring and updating the Interop specification.
  - **Supernode Proof Testing ([#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18621)):** A conversation has started on how to rework proof action testing to better align with the Supernode architecture. The goal is to make tests more accurately reflect the production environment where `op-challenger` relies on Supernode for data.
  - **Node Synchronization Support ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581)):** A user reported "missing trie node" errors, prompting active troubleshooting from the team to diagnose the configuration and environment issues.
  - **ZK Proof Optimization ([#18533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18533)):** The discussion continues on identifying and offloading expensive cryptographic operations like keccak and sha2 to optimize Kona-SP1 performance.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week was marked by deep technical collaboration among core contributors, particularly on foundational architectural issues. The discussions in issues like [#18574](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18574) (Interop) and [#18621](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18621) (Supernode testing) show active debate and consensus-building among key members such as `rdin777`, `ajsutton`, and `Inphi`. Additionally, the direct engagement with user `yaki-1337` on a node synchronization problem ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18581)) demonstrates the team's commitment to supporting the user community.
