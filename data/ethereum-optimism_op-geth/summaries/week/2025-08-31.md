# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's primary achievement was a significant upstream merge, bringing `op-geth` in sync with `go-ethereum v1.16.2`. While code contributions were focused on this integration, substantial effort was dedicated to planning and discussion around key initiatives. Conversations centered on the upcoming Kona and Cannon upgrades, specifically their integration with OPCM and `op-dispute-mon`. Concurrently, the team triaged newly reported issues concerning node stability with large genesis files and RPC query inconsistencies, while also advancing discussions on improving CI/CD infrastructure and P2P configuration defaults.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The week's development work was centered on maintaining alignment with the upstream `go-ethereum` project.

- **Upstream Geth Integration:** The `op-geth` codebase was updated by merging `go-ethereum v1.16.2` ([#663](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/663)). This crucial merge ensures that `op-geth` incorporates the latest changes and improvements from its foundational dependency, affecting numerous components from `cmd/geth` to `accounts/abi`.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week. The focus was on triaging new reports and advancing discussions on complex active issues.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Node Stability and RPC Reliability:** Two significant issues were opened, pointing to potential reliability concerns. One report detailed a `leveldb panic` when initializing a node with a large genesis file ([#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/668)), while another highlighted missing events in `eth_getLogs` calls and high latency ([#667](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/667)).
    - **Kona + Cannon Integration:** Discussions continued on the necessary changes to support the Kona and Cannon upgrades. This included defining requirements for OPCM to handle the new game type ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17285)), ensuring `op-dispute-mon` can correctly process or reject new game types ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17286)), and defining the format for standard prestates ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17283)).
    - **CI/CD and Testing Improvements:** An issue regarding sync testing was reopened to ensure more comprehensive coverage of hard fork transitions ([#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16703)). Separately, a discussion on improving the developer experience for local CI job execution continued, with suggestions for better tooling to manage test prerequisites and sort tests by duration ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17184)).
    - **Configuration and Compatibility:** A bug in the P2P gossip configuration, where default values are incorrectly overwritten with zero values, was actively discussed ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17308)). The team also continued to monitor Go 1.25 compatibility for Cannon, noting that a required MIPS fix may not be in the latest Go patch release ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17060)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This period was characterized by intensive discussion and collaborative problem-solving among core contributors. The active issue threads show focused efforts on multiple fronts:
- **Kona/Cannon Preparation:** Contributors `ajsutton` and `pauldowman` were heavily involved in discussions to scope out the work required for Kona and Cannon support across different parts of the stack.
- **Infrastructure and Tooling:** A collaborative effort to improve the CI/CD developer experience was evident in the detailed feedback exchanged between `bitwiseguy` and `teddyknox` ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17184)).
- **Bug Triage:** The P2P configuration bug ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17308)) saw a technical deep-dive between `wood-jp` and `ajsutton` to identify the root cause and debate the best path to a solution, highlighting a rigorous approach to maintaining code quality.
