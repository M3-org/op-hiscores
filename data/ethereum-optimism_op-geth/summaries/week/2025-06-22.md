# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by a significant milestone with the successful enablement and acceptance testing of flashblocks on the eris-0 devnet. Alongside this feature rollout, the team dedicated substantial effort to performance and stability, launching deep investigations into `op-batcher` memory consumption and abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth`. Development also focused on refining core protocol mechanics, with new work initiated to improve L1 data availability cost functions and streamline priority fee calculations. Overall, the week reflects a dual focus on shipping major new features while simultaneously hardening the existing stack.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on enhancing the transaction pool and initiating several key protocol refinements.

-   **Transaction Pool Enhancements:** The transaction pool was improved with the addition of periodic transaction filtering ([#629](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/629)). This enhancement, which led to the closure of a long-standing issue ([#494](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/494)), aims to improve the efficiency and management of transactions within the pool.

-   **New Protocol Refinements Initiated:** Several new pull requests were opened to refine core protocol logic and add new configuration options:
    -   **L1 Cost and Fee Calculation:** Work began on refining L1 Data Availability (DA) cost functions through a general fix ([#630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/630)) and a specific update for calldata costs ([#631](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/631)). Another PR aims to remove Optimism-specific priority fee estimate calculations ([#632](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/632)), likely to streamline the process and improve Superchain interoperability.
    -   **Contract Size Configuration:** A new feature was proposed to introduce a configurable maximum code size ([#634](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/634)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw the resolution of major integration tasks while new investigations into performance and correctness were kicked off.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Flashblocks Integration Complete:** A major effort concluded with the enablement of flashblocks on the eris-0 devnet ([#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16468)) and the successful completion of transaction acceptance tests ([#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/354)).
    -   **CI, Tooling, and Documentation:** Several housekeeping issues were closed, including one tracking CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16271)), an improvement to allow predeploy modification in Supersim ([#393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/393)), and a fix for a broken documentation link ([#283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/283)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Performance and Stability Investigations:** A significant portion of the week's discussions centered on performance bottlenecks and stability.
        -   **`op-batcher` Memory:** An investigation into `op-batcher` memory consumption ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16537)) identified the compressor as the primary cause during L1 congestion. A
