# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Jun 8 - 14, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity in `op-geth` was centered on maintenance and problem-solving rather than new feature development. A minor but important bug fix was merged to ensure correct gas accounting. The primary focus, however, was on diagnosing and discussing several critical active issues, including an `op-supervisor` event overflow, CI flakiness, and an incorrect nonce bug in `eth_getTransactionCount`. These discussions highlight a concerted effort to improve the stability and reliability of the core infrastructure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The week saw one targeted bug fix aimed at improving protocol correctness.

- **Gas Calculation Fix:** A minor adjustment was merged to correctly initialize `gasRemaining` during state transitions. This change ([#627](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/627)) prevents a potential gas accounting error by using an assignment operator instead of an addition operator, aligning `op-geth` with an upstream Geth fix.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was the main focus this week, with progress made on tracking work and deep discussions on several high-priority problems.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Operator Fee Tracking:** Issue [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/501), which tracked the work for operator fees in `op-geth` and was linked to a design document, was closed.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **System Stability:** Significant discussion occurred around issue [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16335), where the `op-supervisor` can crash due to an event overflow. Contributors are actively diagnosing the problem, proposing the addition of counters and gauges to identify the specific event type causing the overflow.
  - **RPC & State Bugs:** Users are seeking updates on long-standing issues. A user requested a status update on [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/623), a bug where `eth_getTransactionCount` returns an incorrect nonce, causing transactions to get stuck. Similarly, a user asked for progress on [#390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/390), which concerns the need for a comprehensive state dumping function.
  - **Fault Proofs:** Discussions continued on [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15789) regarding changes needed for the fault proof creator contract, with a detailed checklist of required tasks being outlined.
  - **CI Flakiness:** The investigation into CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16271)) is ongoing, with recent comments suggesting that most flakiness originates from infrastructure issues rather than the tests themselves.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions within issue threads. Multiple team members, including `nonsense`, `sebastianst`, and `axelKingsley`, were actively engaged in diagnosing the complex `op-supervisor` event overflow issue. The community's reliance on `op-geth` was also visible, with users actively following up on bugs affecting their transaction processing and state management workflows, demonstrating a keen interest in the project's stability and feature set.
