# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Sep 28 - 4, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked a major milestone with the successful enablement of Flashblocks on op-mainnet, completing a significant effort to bring preconfirmations to the network. This rollout was supported by comprehensive documentation, a public blog post, and refined operational alerts. Development also focused on enhancing network stability by integrating upstream Geth fixes to bolster Fusaka defense on Sepolia. Looking ahead, a new proposal was opened to rethink how the Data Availability (DA) footprint is stored, signaling future architectural improvements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on integrating upstream changes and initiating new performance benchmarks.

- **Upstream Geth Integration for Fusaka Defense:** To improve security on Sepolia, critical upstream Geth pull requests were cherry-picked. This effort resolved a configuration bug where `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` used default values instead of the actual config, strengthening the network's Fusaka defense ([#690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/690)).

- **Benchmarking Improvements:** A new pull request was opened to introduce `benchmarkComputeCellProofs`, aiming to add new benchmarking capabilities to the project ([#692](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/692)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was focused on closing out the Flashblocks project and addressing key bugs, while opening discussions for future protocol enhancements.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Rollout Complete:** A series of issues related to the Flashblocks initiative were closed, signifying the project's completion. This included the live enablement on op-mainnet ([#16498](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16498)), on-call onboarding and documentation ([#17142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17142)), publication of a detailed blog post ([#17664](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17664)), and refinement of alerts and runbooks ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17423)).
    - **Bug Fixes:** A synchronization issue in the op-node's EL sync code path was resolved and confirmed via testing ([#17564](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17564)). The `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` bug was also closed with the merge of an upstream Geth fix ([#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/685)).
    - **Component Refactoring:** An issue to split `op-node` components was closed as "not planned," clarifying the project's direction ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16680)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Data Availability Footprint:** A new issue was opened to discuss storing the total DA footprint in the `blobGasUsed` header field instead of the current `gasUsed` field ([#691](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/691)). This represents a significant potential change for future development.
    - According to the reports, there were no active issues with significant discussion (more than 3 comments) this week.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The successful and multi-faceted rollout of Flashblocks‚Äîspanning live deployment, documentation, operational readiness, and public communication‚Äîhighlights a period of strong internal coordination. The integration of fixes from upstream Geth demonstrates ongoing collaboration with the broader Ethereum ecosystem to ensure client stability and security. Public discussion on GitHub issues was minimal, with no active issues seeing significant comment activity during this period.
