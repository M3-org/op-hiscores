# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week saw significant progress toward the Jovian and Fusaka network upgrades. Key work included finalizing Jovian specifications, removing feature toggles, and updating dependencies, while Fusaka preparations were completed for Sepolia. The team also focused on refining internal tooling and validation processes, deprecating older tools like Kurtosis in favor of new testing methodologies. Discussions around the DA Footprint Limit implementation and maintaining compatibility for zk stacks underscored the project's focus on cross-ecosystem coordination and future-proofing the protocol.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on dependency updates, superchain configuration, and preparing for upcoming network upgrades.

*   **Core Dependencies & Cryptography:**
    *   A pull request was opened to switch to `gnark` for `bn254` curve operations ([#701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/701)).
    *   The `c-kzg-4844` library was updated to version 2.1.5 ([#702](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/702)), ensuring components are using the latest version.

*   **Jovian Upgrade Preparation:**
    *   A significant step was taken to finalize the upgrade with a pull request to remove Jovian feature toggles ([#703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/703)).

*   **Superchain Configuration:**
    *   The superchain registry configurations were updated to include the `worldchain-sepolia` isthmus activation time ([#704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/704)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
Several issues were resolved, primarily related to the Jovian upgrade and the deprecation of older internal processes.

*   **Jovian Upgrade Finalization:** Issues concerning the finalization of Jovian upgrade transaction bytecode ([#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/772)) and the default value for `daFootprintGasScalar` ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/773)) were closed.
*   **Tooling and Process Refinements:** The team has moved away from Kurtosis for local `op-geth` builds ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16975]) and decided not to rewire `interopgen` config, as new tests are handled as acceptance tests ([#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17614)). Additionally, validation checks on PRs are moving to a report-based approach rather than a blocking one ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/689), [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/696)).

### New & Active Issues
Discussions this week focused on upgrade preparations, feature implementation, and developer tooling.

*   **Upgrade Preparations:**
    *   **Fusaka:** While Sepolia preparations are complete, work on Mainnet is still pending ([#682](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/682), [#1206](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/1206)).
    *   **Jovian:** A discussion is underway on how to handle new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` to avoid breaking zk stacks before the Jovian upgrade is active ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17907)).

*   **Feature Development & Bug Fixes:**
    *   **DA Footprint Limit:** Implementation remains blocked pending a spec derivation ([#17551](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17551)). However, a related investigation into a gas scalar bug identified the root cause, and a fix is in progress ([#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17946)).
    *   **Dispute Games:** An issue regarding new dispute game contracts was reopened, as tests are still being skipped when V2 is enabled, requiring further investigation ([#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17267)).

*   **Developer Experience:**
    *   A discussion was initiated to improve `op-up` for local devnets as a replacement for Kurtosis ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17942)).
    *   A new issue regarding an error with `mise install` was reported, with a community member quickly providing a workaround ([#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17963)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted active collaboration on several fronts. The discussion around Jovian config compatibility ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17907)) showed coordination with external teams to ensure API updates do not break dependent stacks. Similarly, the quick response to the `mise` installation issue ([#17963](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17963)) demonstrated the community's responsiveness. Internal discussions, such as the debate on the necessity of a CLI tool for local devnets ([#17942](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/17942)), reflect a healthy process of evaluating technical priorities and resource allocation.
