# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Jul 6 - 12, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the transaction pool's robustness and optimizing block construction performance. Key developments include introducing a per-transaction gas limit and ensuring re-injected transactions are properly filtered after reorgs. The team also improved block building efficiency by removing the `checkInterop` function from the critical path. Several issues related to interop configuration and test reliability were closed, reflecting a push to streamline the codebase and improve stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This week saw targeted improvements in transaction handling, performance, and configuration alignment.

-   **Transaction Pool Enhancements:** Work was done to harden the transaction pool against invalid transactions and improve its validation logic.
    -   A new `MaxTxGasLimit` feature was introduced, allowing sequencers to enforce a gas limit on a per-transaction basis, which is particularly useful for single-sequencer rollups ([#626](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/626)).
    -   The pool's logic was refactored to ensure that transactions re-injected into the mempool after a reorg are correctly re-evaluated by ingress filters, fixing a validation loophole ([#642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/642)).

-   **Performance Optimization:** A significant change was merged to improve performance during block construction.
    -   To reduce block construction time, the `checkInterop` function was removed from the block building path, addressing concerns about excessive time consumption ([#585](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/585)).

-   **Superchain Alignment:** The project was updated to stay in sync with the broader Superchain ecosystem.
    -   The Superchain Registry commit was bumped to `6621a0f1`, ensuring `op-geth` is aligned with the latest Superchain configurations ([#640](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/640)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving bugs, clarifying responsibilities for interop configuration, and investigating user-reported performance problems.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Interop & Genesis:** An issue regarding interop predeploys in the L2 genesis state was closed, with the conclusion that this validation is better handled by genesis generation tooling rather than the execution client ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15765)). A proposal to add a pre-Interop logic mode to `op-node` was also deprioritized and closed ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16520)).
    -   **Transaction Filtering:** An issue concerning the lack of filter re-evaluation for re-injected transactions was opened and promptly resolved by PR [#642](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/642) ([#641](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/641)).
    -   **Reliability & Testing:** An issue regarding acceptance test reliability was closed after noting significant improvements ([#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16378]). An issue related to flashblocks acceptance testing was also opened and closed on the same day ([#16630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16630)).
    -   **RPC:** An `op-batcher` issue causing RPC errors was closed due to inactivity, with a request to reopen if it recurs ([#15355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15355)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Performance:** An investigation into abnormal CPU usage on `op-geth` v1.101511.0 is ongoing. Maintainers are guiding users on how to capture performance profiles, with initial data suggesting the issue may be related to time-intensive index updates during node startup ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/613)).
    -   **Fault Proofs:** Discussion continues on the required OPCM changes for the Fault Proof creator contract, with a detailed task checklist being developed to guide implementation ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15789)).
    -   **Documentation:** The v3 fault proof incident runbook is undergoing a final review before being marked as official ([#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16651)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
-   The resolution of the interop prestate issue ([#15765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/15765)) highlights effective cross-project coordination, as the responsibility for validation was shifted from `op-geth` to the more appropriate `op-deployer` tooling.
-   Active collaboration between maintainers and users is evident in the handling of the CPU usage issue ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/613)), where the team is working directly with the community to diagnose the problem.
-   The project demonstrated clear prioritization by formally deprioritizing and closing an issue for `op-node` interop logic ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16520)), allowing the team to focus on more critical tasks.
