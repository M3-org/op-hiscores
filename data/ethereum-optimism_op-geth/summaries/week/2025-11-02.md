# ethereum-optimism/op-geth Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on preparing for upcoming network upgrades and enhancing network stability. Key timestamps for the Fusaka, BPO1, and BPO2 mainnet upgrades were officially set, and the Superchain registry was updated to maintain cross-chain synchronization. On the security front, a significant change was implemented to restrict mempool access to trusted peers only. Concurrently, deep architectural discussions took place around improving the robustness of core components like `proxyd` and `op-batcher` to handle synchronization and configuration drift.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on preparing for future network milestones and hardening the existing system against security vulnerabilities and database corruption.

- **Network Upgrade Preparation**
  - Timestamps for the upcoming Fusaka, BPO1, and BPO2 mainnet upgrades were set in the `op-geth` parameters, a critical step in coordinating the network-wide rollout of these changes ([#715](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/715)).
  - The Superchain registry was updated with new Jovian timestamps to ensure continued interoperability and synchronization across the Superchain ecosystem ([#716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/716)).

- **Security and Stability Enhancements**
  - To bolster network security, the transaction mempool was configured to only accept transactions from trusted peers, reducing the surface area for potential spam or denial-of-service attacks ([#719](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/719)).
  - A rare database corruption bug was fixed by ensuring the ancient store is fully synchronized before journaling. This prevents `history head truncation out of range` errors and improves data integrity ([#718](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/718)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving dependency and testing-related issues while opening new discussions on core component architecture and security.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - A broken dependency on `go-bip39` within `op-chain-ops` was resolved, unblocking related development ([#16612](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16612)).
  - An old issue regarding the reporting of unused acceptance tests was closed, reflecting a shift in the team's testing strategy towards using gateless mode ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/16273)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - A significant discussion began around the `op-batcher`'s behavior, which currently fetches its rollup configuration only once at startup. This could lead to issues if the config changes, prompting a debate on whether the operator should provide the config explicitly or if the batcher should dynamically reload it ([#18178](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18178)).
  - A new issue was opened to add a flag for limiting the transaction mempool to trusted peers ([#717](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/717)), which was quickly addressed by PR [#719](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/719).
  - There is an ongoing in-depth discussion on how to prevent `proxyd` from serving stale data when its backends are out of sync. Solutions being explored include "multicall" strategies and various forms of sticky sessions to avoid "backwards time travel" for methods like `eth_call` and `eth_estimateGas` ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/501)).
  - Discussions also continued on strategies for tracking blob priority fees in the `op-batcher` ([#18102](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/18102)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. The `proxyd` synchronization issue ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/501)) saw multiple contributors (joshklop, yashvardhan-kukreja) brainstorming and weighing the pros and cons of several complex solutions. The rapid progression of the mempool restriction from a newly opened issue ([#717](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/issues/717)) to a merged pull request ([#719](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/719)) demonstrates the team's responsiveness to security and configuration enhancements.
