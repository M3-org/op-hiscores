L1 Mainnet beacon endpoint\n2. L2 OP Mainnet EL endpoint\n3. L2 Base Mainnet EL endpoint\n4. L2 Base Sepolia EL endpoint\n\n## Background\n\nop-sync-tester is a tool that mocks L2 EL. To test the L2 CL(especially the op-node) targeting the real chain, we needed some synced real L2 EL which is stateful. op-sync-tester mocks upon already synced L2 EL, and gives ease of testing the L2 CL implementation.\n\nTo mock, we need L2 EL endpoint, and to signal the L2 CL, we need L1 EL and L1 Beacon endpoint. \n\n",

      "number": 457,
      "body": "# Overview\r\nUsers of `op-acceptor` would like more information to help debug tests that are stalled or taking longer than expected. Prior to this pr there was the framework for a `ProgressIndicator` to provide feedback to the user about testing progress, but only a no-op indicator was used. This pr adds a `ConsoleProgressIndicator`, which will print logs to the console while tests are running. Logs have this format:\r\n```\r\nINFO [09-11|14:12:31.263] progress update                          gate=gateless suite= completed=1 total=32 percent=3.1% numRunning=16 longestRunning=\"./tests/interop/message (5s), ./tests/interop/prep (5s), ./tests/interop/proofs (5s), +13 more\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Details\r\nCurrently, the `ConsoleProgressIndicator` is disabled by default. To enable it, set the `ShowProgress = true` field on the `op-acceptor` config. There is also a new config field for `ProgressInterval` (how often to print a log/update), which defaults to 30s.\r\n\r\nOnly the 3 longest running tests are logged at any given time (to keep logging printout minimal while still providing the most useful information). As tests complete, they are removed from the data structures that are used to populate the progress logs.\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\nAdded `progress_test.go` to test the new functionality by capturing logs and parsing them for expected output.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n* Closes https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/456",
