      "body": "This pull request refactors the CI workflow configuration for building Docker images in this repository. It consolidates multiple service-specific workflow files into two new workflows: one for protected branches/tags and one for unprotected branches (PRs), streamlining and centralizing the build process. The new approach uses matrix builds and improved tag parsing, making maintenance and scaling easier.\r\n\r\nWorkflow consolidation and simplification:\r\n\r\n* Removed individual workflow files for each service (`cci-stats`, `op-acceptor`, `op-conductor-mon`, `op-conductor-ops`, `op-signer`, `op-txproxy`, `op-ufm`, `peer-mgmt-service`, `proxyd`, `replica-healthcheck`) and replaced them with a single matrix-based build step in the new workflows.
