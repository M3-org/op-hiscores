# ethereum-optimism/infra Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December saw significant progress in maturing the project's tooling and infrastructure, particularly around Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof handling and CI/CD pipelines. The team decisively moved forward with `op-challenger` for ZK games, closing a large volume of related issues and solidifying the strategy. Development infrastructure was a key focus, with major refactoring of CI workflows to improve reliability and maintainability, alongside feature and stability enhancements to the `op-acceptor` testing tool. However, the month was also marked by critical operational challenges, with multiple active issues related to `op-node` synchronization problems impacting node operators on Base Mainnet.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month focused on improving the reliability of both testing tools and the core development pipeline.

- **`op-acceptor` Tooling Enhancements:** The `op-acceptor` testing tool received significant upgrades to improve its flexibility and stability. A key update introduced multi-gate input and a dry-run option, enhancing its testing capabilities for complex conditions ([#520]). A subsequent bug fix improved resource management by streaming stdout directly to disk to reduce RAM usage and adding a signal handler for more graceful exits ([#525]).

- **CI/CD Workflow Optimization:** A series of changes were implemented to streamline and harden the continuous integration process. CI configurations were refactored to split workflow runs between protected and unprotected branches, simplifying maintenance ([#519]). Critical bug fixes were merged to ensure Docker image builds succeed by correctly setting the repository root as the build context, resolving pathing errors in both the `replica-healthcheck` image ([#521]) and the general tags workflow ([#522]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month was characterized by the resolution of a major strategic question around ZK games, while new and persistent node synchronization issues emerged as a primary concern.

- **Closed Issues:** A major theme was the closure of numerous issues related to ZK proof generation and challenger support. The decision was finalized to use `op-challenger` for ZK games ([#18322]), and related implementation tasks were completed, including support for ZK game types ([#18321]) and various configuration and bond-handling capabilities ([#18412], [#18413], [#18414], [#18415], [#18427]). Additionally, an issue defining the acceptance criteria for `rollup-boost` reversion was successfully closed ([#315]).

- **New & Active Issues:** Several critical issues affecting node operations are under active investigation.
    - **Node Synchronization Blockers:** A high-priority issue involves `op-node` getting stuck in EL sync mode after a restart, impacting Base Mainnet nodes ([#18468]). A separate issue reports that `op-node` v1.16.3 is failing to synchronize across multiple chains ([#18510]), indicating a potentially widespread problem.
    - **`proxyd` "Backwards Time Travel":** Discussion continued on a significant architectural issue where `proxyd` can serve stale blocks when backends are out of sync ([#501]). While a fix is planned for January, the issue represents a potential data consistency risk.
    - **Superchain Configuration:** The effort to port the `SuperchainConfig` type from the `superchain-registry` continues, with ongoing discussion around the specification format ([#741]).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The project saw notable engagement from the contributor community this month, with individuals actively seeking to contribute to a variety of open issues.

- A contributor, @Himess, showed significant initiative by inquiring about taking on a wide range of tasks, including fixing a test setup failure ([#15220]), removing `isPectra` from the batcher ([#18479]), and addressing documentation inaccuracies in MIPS memory contracts ([#13435], [#13436]).

- Collaborative debugging was evident in the active `op-node` synchronization issues, where maintainers and users worked together to diagnose problems by sharing logs and suggesting workarounds ([#18510], [#18468]).

- The discussion around porting the `SuperchainConfig` type ([#741]) also highlighted collaboration, with feedback from @emhane being incorporated into a new pull request by @Himess.
