# ethereum-optimism/infra Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December was a month of focused infrastructure hardening and significant progress on Zero-Knowledge (ZK) integration, contrasted by the emergence of critical node stability challenges. Development efforts centered on enhancing the `op-acceptor` testing tool with new features and crucial stability fixes. The team also made substantial strides in CI/CD pipeline reliability by refactoring workflows and correcting build context issues. A major milestone was achieved with the closure of numerous issues related to ZK proof generation and `op-challenger` support, solidifying the path forward for ZK games. However, the latter part of the month was marked by reports of widespread node synchronization failures, which became a top priority for investigation.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month concentrated on improving the reliability and functionality of core infrastructure components and development processes.

- **`op-acceptor` Enhancements:** The `op-acceptor` tool received significant upgrades to improve its testing capabilities and stability. A key feature addition introduced multi-gate input and a dry-run option for more flexible testing scenarios ([#520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/520)). Stability was bolstered through critical bug fixes, including streaming logs to disk to reduce RAM usage ([#525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/525)) and resolving a memory leak caused by excessive subtest logging in CI ([#526](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/526)). Test handling for CLI flags was also corrected to prevent unnecessary validation ([#528](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/528)).

- **CI/CD and Release Process Refinements:** The project's continuous integration and release pipelines were streamlined for better maintainability and reliability. CI workflows were refactored to separate runs for protected and unprotected branches, simplifying the configuration ([#519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/519)). Critical bugs in the Docker build process were fixed by ensuring the repository root was used as the build context, resolving "not found" errors for the `replica-healthcheck` image and tag-triggered builds ([#521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/521), [#522](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/522)). Additionally, `goreleaser` configurations were updated to ensure GitHub accurately reflects the latest releases ([#527](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/527)).

- **Ownership and Dependency Management:** Housekeeping tasks included updating the CODEOWNERS file for `op-txproxy` to the ecosystem team ([#529](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/529)) and performing dependency updates, such as bumping `quic-go` in the `peer-mgmt-service` ([#530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/530)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The month saw the resolution of key strategic issues while uncovering new, high-priority stability problems.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **ZK Challenger Integration:** A significant cluster of issues related to ZK support was closed, marking a major step forward. The decision was finalized to use `op-challenger` for ZK games ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18322)), and work was completed to enable `op-challenger` support for ZK game types ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18321)). A series of related issues concerning challenger bond handling, configuration, and test coverage were also resolved ([#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18412), [#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18413), [#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18414), [#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18415), [#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18427)).
    - **Rollup-Boost Reversion:** An issue defining the acceptance criteria for `rollup-boost` to revert to default EL block building under failure conditions was successfully closed ([#315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/315)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Critical Node Synchronization Failures:** The most pressing new issue is [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18581), which details widespread node synchronization failures with "missing trie node" errors affecting Optimism, Base, and Unichain. This issue is a potential blocker for node operators. A related problem, [#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18468), where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart, continues to affect Base Mainnet nodes.
    - **`proxyd` "Backwards Time Travel":** Discussion continued on the complex `proxyd` issue ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/501)) where out-of-sync backends can cause the `unsafe` block to move backwards. A resolution is planned for January.
    - **`op-node` Sequencer Behavior:** An investigation is ongoing into a potential bug in `op-node`'s sequencer recover mode, where it may stall derivation if a bad batch gets on L1 ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18350)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was notably strong this month, highlighted by the proactive involvement of contributor "Himess." They expressed interest in tackling a wide array of issues, including porting the `SuperchainConfig` type ([#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/741)), fixing incorrect comments from a past audit ([#13435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/13435), [#13436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/13436)), and taking ownership of creating a new replica health check for `op-rbuilder` ([#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17685)). This level of initiative demonstrates a healthy and growing contributor ecosystem. Furthermore, the active debugging discussions on node synchronization issues ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18510), [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18581)) showcased strong collaboration between maintainers and the community, with team members actively requesting logs and providing support to affected users.
