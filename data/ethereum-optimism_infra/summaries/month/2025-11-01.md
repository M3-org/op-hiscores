# ethereum-optimism/infra Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Based on the provided reports, November was a month focused on enhancing the stability and observability of core infrastructure components. Significant progress was made in resolving long-standing issues, particularly in improving `proxyd`'s resilience and reducing test flakiness. While no major features were completed, new work was initiated to expand RPC method support, and important discussions continued around aligning component behavior with the official Optimism specifications, particularly for the `op-batcher`.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
No major technical developments were completed according to the provided daily reports. The primary development activity involved initiating new work and resolving existing issues.

A new pull request ([#504](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/504)) was opened to lay the groundwork for adding all potential RPC method mappings, aiming to improve the service's completeness and compatibility.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month centered on closing out stability-related problems and discussing specification alignment for critical components.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **`proxyd` Stability:** Two key issues ([#364](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/364), [#365](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/365)) related to `proxyd` interop message validation were closed. This work addressed load testing, supervisor DoS prevention, and enhanced observability through better instrumentation and metrics.
    - **Test Suite Health:** A flaky test in `op-acceptance-tests`, `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor`, was resolved, leading to the closure of issue [#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17548) and improving the reliability of the CI pipeline.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened based on the provided reports.
    - An important discussion continued in issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17796) regarding the `op-batcher`. The component is not limiting the max frame size in generic mode for alternative DA, which contradicts the current Optimism specification. The conversation suggests that the specification itself may require an update to reflect the implemented behavior, highlighting the need for cross-repository coordination.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the ongoing technical discussions around specification alignment. The active issue concerning the `op-batcher` ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17796)) shows contributors working to ensure that the implementation details in the `infra` repository are correctly reflected in the broader Optimism project specifications. This cross-cutting concern demonstrates a healthy feedback loop between different parts of the ecosystem.
