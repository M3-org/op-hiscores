# ethereum-optimism/infra Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of significant refinement and stabilization for the project's infrastructure, with a strong focus on enhancing the testing framework and improving the robustness of core services. The `op-acceptor` tool received major upgrades, including parallel test execution and more flexible test handling, which dramatically improves CI efficiency and reliability. Concurrently, `proxyd` was enhanced with more granular controls for rate limiting and timeouts, bolstering its performance and configurability. The team also made substantial progress in migrating acceptance tests to `devstack`, closing out a large volume of legacy issues and paving the way for more consistent testing environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month's development work centered on improving the testing pipeline and core infrastructure components.

-   **Testing Framework (`op-acceptor`) Overhaul:** A series of updates significantly improved the `op-acceptor` tool, making the testing process faster and more reliable.
    -   **Performance:** Parallel test execution was introduced as a default behavior, automatically scaling with system cores to improve testing efficiency ([#438](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/438)).
    -   **Features:** A new "gateless" mode allows for automatic discovery and execution of tests within a directory ([#428](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/428]), and a flag was added to allow test skips to be treated as skips instead of failures ([#435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/435]).
    -   **Bug Fixes:** Several fixes addressed flaky tests and reporting inaccuracies, including one that caused failed runs to report zero duration ([#425](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/425), [#430](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/430), [#431](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/431)).

-   **`proxyd` Enhancements:** The `proxyd` service received several key features to improve its robustness, control, and observability.
    -   A new feature for flashblocks-aware routing was introduced ([#418](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/418)).
    -   Error handling was improved with a "499" error code to specifically track client-canceled requests ([#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/420)).
    -   Conditional rate limiting for transaction senders was added ([#421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/421)).
    -   Configuration was made more granular, allowing backend response timeouts to be set in milliseconds on a per-backend basis ([#436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/436)).

-   **New Components & Service Updates:**
    -   The initial commit for `op-spamoor` was made, marking the start of a new component ([#422](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/422)).
    -   The `op-ufm` package was updated to improve logging for "transaction not found" errors and to functionally ignore them in certain contexts ([#433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/433), [#437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/437)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in July focused on clearing a backlog of testing-related tasks and addressing long-standing stability concerns, while also initiating discussions on future infrastructure work.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Acceptance Test Migration:** A major effort was completed to port numerous acceptance tests to `devstack`, resolving a series of related issues. This included tests for `ChainFork` ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/413)), `WithdrawalsRoot` ([#412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/412)), `ERC20Bridge` ([#415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/415)), `OperatorFee` ([#414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/414)), and `Pectra` ([#416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/416)).
    -   **Stability and Reliability:** Several long-standing issues concerning sequencer stability ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/11228), [#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/12240)]) and test flakiness ([#348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/348), [#244](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/244)]) were closed, indicating improved system reliability.
    -   **Flashblocks Deployment:** The task to deploy the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` in op-sepolia was completed ([#16686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16686)), and strategic discussions around flashblocks infrastructure were concluded ([#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16496), [#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16689)]).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Future Work:** New issues were opened to guide upcoming efforts, including aligning the Kurtosisnet test topology with production ([#16746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16746)), migrating from Etherscan to Blockscout ([#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1696)), and porting `TestFjord` to devstack ([#440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/440)).
    -   **Ongoing Discussions:** Key active discussions include establishing comprehensive monitoring and alerting for flashblocks ([#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16388)), tracking the implementation of a minimum base fee ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16807)), and designing a system for congestion-based transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/306)).
    -   **Persistent Bugs:** A difficult-to-reproduce bug where invalid interop transactions are occasionally included in the mempool remains an active area of investigation ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/635)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the detailed planning and cross-repository coordination throughout the month. The extensive discussion on establishing flashblocks monitoring and alerting ([#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16388)) highlights a proactive approach to operational readiness, with clear definitions of metrics and SLAs. The frequent cross-referencing of pull requests between the `infra` and `optimism` repositories, particularly for the acceptance test porting effort, demonstrates strong alignment between teams. Additionally, community interest in contributing to future designs was seen in the discussion around congestion-based transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/306)), indicating healthy external engagement with the project's roadmap.
