# ethereum-optimism/infra Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of targeted enhancements to infrastructure tooling and the resolution of long-standing items. Development focused heavily on improving the robustness of the testing framework, particularly `op-acceptor`, by adding more flexible configuration and stricter test exclusion logic. Significant progress was also made in operational tooling, with improved transaction logging in `proxyd` and a key bug fix in `op-conductor-ops`. The official closure of the Isthmus Upgrade tracking issue marked a major milestone. Meanwhile, important discussions emerged around the reliability of `op-dispute-mon` and compatibility issues with Go 1.25, setting the stage for future work on protocol security and stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on refining testing capabilities and improving the reliability of operational components.

- **Refinements to Testing Infrastructure (`op-acceptor`)**
  - To enable more flexible test execution, `op-acceptor` was updated to forward environment variables to `go test` ([#483](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/483)).
  - The test blacklisting functionality was improved with the introduction of stricter exclusion gates, ensuring that all tests within a specified gate are blacklisted, which refines the test selection logic ([#490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/490)).

- **Improvements to Operational Tooling and Observability**
  - For better debugging and monitoring, `proxyd` now includes comprehensive logging for `eth_sendRawTransaction` and `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` requests, capturing details like transaction hash, request ID, and chain ID ([#481](httpshttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/481)).
  - A critical bug in the `op-conductor-ops` tool was fixed, correcting a typo that caused new members to always be assigned as voters. This ensures proper role assignment during conductor configuration changes ([#492](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/492)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month saw the closure of major upgrade and testing-related tasks, while new discussions highlighted potential vulnerabilities and future integration challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Upgrade Finalization:** The tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/12703)) was formally closed, confirming its completion.
  - **Testing Enhancements:** Several issues related to `op-acceptor` were resolved, including forwarding environment variables ([#482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/482]) and improving parallelism ([#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/462)). Additionally, issues for adding acceptance ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17278)) and unit tests ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17395)) for the DA Footprint Limit were closed.
  - **Configuration & Cleanup:** An `op-node` architecture refinement was deemed "not planned" ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16680]), and an issue to update Sepolia sequencer configuration was resolved ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17683)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Dispute Monitor Reliability:** A significant discussion emerged in [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17814) concerning `op-dispute-mon` incorrectly flagging disagreements when a rollup RPC is out of sync. The conversation points toward needing a more robust solution that verifies node sync status before treating differing outputs as a dispute.
  - **Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility:** The ongoing issue [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17060) remains a key concern, as it causes incorrect Keccak hashes within Cannon and affects fault proof integrity.
  - **`op-reth` Integration Strategy:** Discussion on [#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17475) shifted from integrating `op-reth` into the deprecated Kurtosis devnet to focusing on the devstack/sysgo system, reflecting an updated integration path.
  - **Sequencer Startup Bug:** A new bug was reported in [#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17899) where `op-conductor` fails to start a sequencer, indicating a potential regression or new edge case in the conductor logic.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident in the active triage of complex, long-term issues. The discussion around Cannon's compatibility with Go 1.25 ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17060)) involved multiple team members providing detailed diagnoses and linking to upstream dependencies. Similarly, the strategic pivot on `op-reth` integration ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17475)) showed maintainers guiding the project's direction. The handling of a contribution on [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17686) demonstrated active mentorship, with a maintainer clarifying scope and process for new contributors. This points to a healthy environment of both strategic planning and collaborative problem-solving.
