# ethereum-optimism/infra Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of targeted enhancements and strategic resolutions for the Optimism infrastructure. Development focused heavily on improving the robustness of the testing framework, with significant upgrades to the `op-acceptor` tool to allow for more flexible and controlled test execution. Observability was also a key theme, with `proxyd` gaining enhanced transaction logging to aid in debugging. On the project management front, the team officially closed the book on the Isthmus Upgrade, marking a major milestone. Meanwhile, important discussions emerged around the security of the dispute monitoring system, highlighting a potential vulnerability in how `op-dispute-mon` handles out-of-sync nodes, which will be a critical area of focus moving forward.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on refining core infrastructure components, particularly around testing, observability, and operational tooling.

-   **Testing Infrastructure Enhancements (`op-acceptor`)**
    Efforts were made to improve the flexibility and precision of the `op-acceptor` testing tool. A new feature was added to forward environment variables to `go test`, enabling more customized test runs ([#483](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/483)). Additionally, the tool's exclusion logic was made stricter, ensuring that tests within blacklisted gates are always excluded, which refines the test filtering process ([#490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/490)).

-   **Improved Observability in `proxyd`**
    To enhance debugging and monitoring capabilities, `proxyd` was updated with comprehensive logging for `eth_sendRawTransaction` and `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` requests. These new logs include critical context such as transaction hash, request ID, chain ID, and nonce, providing deeper insight into transaction submission pathways ([#481](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/481)).

-   **Conductor Operations Tooling Fix**
    A small but important bug fix was merged for the `op-conductor-ops` tool. The change corrects a faulty assumption where adding a new member was always treated as adding a voter, ensuring more accurate conductor configuration ([#492](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/492)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month saw the resolution of several long-standing items, including a major network upgrade, while also surfacing new critical areas for investigation.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Isthmus Upgrade Finalized:** The tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/12703)) was closed, formally concluding this major effort.
    -   **Testing and Configuration:** Several issues related to `op-acceptor` enhancements ([#482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/482), [#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/462)), Data Availability footprint limit tests ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17278), [#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17395)), and Sepolia sequencer configuration ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17683)) were resolved.
    -   **Architectural Decisions:** An issue proposing a split of the `op-node` architecture was closed as "not planned" ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16680)), providing clarity on the project's direction.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Dispute Monitor Vulnerability:** A critical discussion is ongoing in [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17814) regarding `op-dispute-mon`. The tool may incorrectly flag a disagreement if one of its monitored RPCs is out of sync. The conversation suggests that a robust solution is needed to verify a node's L2 head against its processed L1 blocks, as simply trusting the highest block number could be insecure.
    -   **Cannon Go Compatibility:** The issue of Cannon's incompatibility with Go 1.25, which causes incorrect Keccak hashes, remains active ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17060)). This is a significant blocker with a dependency on an upstream Go issue.
    -   **Sequencer Startup Failure:** A new bug was reported where `op-conductor` fails to start a sequencer with a "no unsafe head" error ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17899)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident in the active discussions around complex technical challenges. The dialogue on `op-dispute-mon` ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17814)) and Cannon compatibility ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17060)) involved multiple stakeholders diagnosing problems and proposing solutions. There was also clear maintainer guidance on contribution processes, as seen in the discussion around replica-healthchecks ([#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17686)), which helps align community efforts with project priorities. Finally, the discussion around re-integrating `op-reth` ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17475)) demonstrated the team's adaptability, shifting focus from a deprecated tool (Kurtosis devnet) to the current `devstack/sysgo` system.
