# ethereum-optimism/infra Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of refinement and forward-planning for the Optimism infrastructure. Development focused heavily on improving the robustness of core tooling, with significant enhancements to the `op-acceptor` testing framework and `proxyd` observability. The team officially closed out the long-running Isthmus upgrade, marking a major milestone. Concurrently, new and complex challenges emerged, particularly around dispute monitoring with out-of-sync nodes and a critical compatibility issue with Go 1.25, setting the stage for future work on protocol security and stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving the developer experience and operational stability through tooling enhancements.

-   **Enhanced Observability in `proxyd`**: To improve debugging and monitoring, `proxyd` was updated to include comprehensive logging for `eth_sendRawTransaction` and `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` requests. The new logs capture critical details such as transaction hash, method, request ID, and chain ID, with integration tests added to validate the functionality ([#481](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/481)).

-   **Testing Framework Improvements**: The `op-acceptor` component received several key updates to improve test execution and flexibility. A new feature was added to allow environment variables to be passed through to `go test`, enabling more controlled testing scenarios ([#483](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/483)). Work also began on implementing stricter exclusion gates to refine its filtering capabilities ([#490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/490)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in October involved resolving legacy items while identifying new, systemic challenges.

-   **Closed Issues:** Several significant issues were resolved and closed, signifying progress and finalization of major efforts.
    -   **Upgrade Finalization:** The tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade was officially closed, confirming the upgrade's completion ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/12703)).
    -   **Tooling & Test Fixes:** A series of issues related to `op-acceptor` were addressed, including forwarding environment variables ([#482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/482)), improving package parallelism ([#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/462)), and enhancing HTML output ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/386)).
    -   **Architecture & Alerts:** A proposal to refactor the `op-node` architecture was closed as "not planned" ([#16680](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16680)), and an issue to refine flashblock alerts was also completed ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17423)).

-   **New & Active Issues:** Discussions this month highlighted several critical areas requiring attention.
    -   **Dispute Monitoring Vulnerability:** A significant discussion emerged around `op-dispute-mon` incorrectly flagging disagreements when a rollup RPC is out of sync ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17814)). The conversation points toward needing a more robust solution that verifies node sync status before treating differing outputs as a dispute.
    -   **Go 1.25 Compatibility Blocker:** An ongoing issue with Cannon's compatibility with Go 1.25 was confirmed to affect Optimism by causing incorrect Keccak hashes ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17060)). This represents a potential blocker for future Go version upgrades.
    -   **Dev Environment Strategy:** A discussion on re-integrating `op-reth` into acceptance tests led to a strategic pivot, with the team deciding to focus on integration with the current `devstack/sysgo` system rather than the deprecated Kurtosis devnet ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17475)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was characterized by deep-dive discussions on complex technical issues. The active threads concerning `op-dispute-mon` ([#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17814)), Cannon/Go compatibility ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17060)), and `op-reth` integration ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17475)) showcased detailed problem-solving among core contributors. This focus on diagnosing and addressing systemic challenges, rather than just shipping features, indicates a strong commitment to the long-term health and security of the Superchain ecosystem.
