# ethereum-optimism/infra Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
June was a month of stabilization and refinement for the Optimism infrastructure. Significant effort was dedicated to improving the reliability of the CI/CD pipeline and acceptance tests, culminating in the closure of a major investigation into test flakiness. Core infrastructure components like `proxyd` and `op-conductor-ops` received critical bug fixes and performance enhancements to bolster stability. A major push was made to mature the Superchain-Ops tooling, with a large batch of issues being closed to streamline task simulation, validation, and developer experience. Concurrently, new investigations were launched into performance bottlenecks, particularly the memory consumption of `op-batcher` under load, signaling a proactive focus on system resilience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on enhancing the stability and usability of core infrastructure services and testing frameworks.

- **`proxyd` and `op-conductor-ops` Reliability:**
  - A critical bug was fixed in `op-conductor-ops` to prevent it from exiting prematurely during sequencer bootstrapping, ensuring at least one sequencer is active ([#404](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/404)).
  - `proxyd` performance was improved by bypassing its concurrency semaphore when unlimited concurrency is configured ([#405](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/405)).
  - A bug in `proxyd` was also fixed where request size limits were checked too early; the check now occurs after interop transaction recognition, preventing incorrect rejections ([#407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/407)).

- **`op-acceptor` Testing Framework Enhancements:**
  - The `op-acceptor` framework was significantly improved with first-class support for `op-devstack` orchestrator modes, enabling in-memory testing ([#411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/411)).
  - To improve usability, HTML reports generated by `op-acceptor` now display an overall pass/fail status ([#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/408)).
  - A persistent test flake in `TestRealtimeLogs` was addressed to increase the reliability of test results ([#409](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/409)).

- **Dependency Management:**
  - Routine dependency updates were made in `op-conductor-ops` to bump `requests` to v2.32.4 ([#403](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/403)) and `urllib3` to v2.5.0 ([#410](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/410)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project saw a concerted effort to resolve long-standing issues related to testing and tooling, while opening new investigations into performance and observability.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **CI/CD and Testing:** A major investigation into CI flakiness was closed after the release of a test flake report generator and significant stability improvements ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16271)). Discussions on implementing CI SLAs were also concluded for now ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16437)). Several key tests were completed and closed, including the full L2-to-L1 withdrawal flow test ([#327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/327)) and acceptance tests for flashblocks ([#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/354)).
  - **Superchain-Ops Tooling:** A large-scale cleanup resulted in the closure of over a dozen issues related to the Superchain-Ops tooling. This effort streamlined CI task execution ([#337](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/337]), improved nonce handling for stacked proposals ([#342](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/342), [#770](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/770)), enhanced state diff reporting ([#777](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/777)), and refactored the overall MultisigTask architecture ([#636](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/636)).
  - **Documentation:** Several documentation issues were resolved, including removing outdated information on the deprecated `L2OutputOracleProxy` ([#1614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1614)) and fixing broken links ([#283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/283)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Performance and Observability:** A key focus for new work is on performance. A spike was initiated to investigate and optimize `op-batcher` memory consumption during L1 congestion ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16537]), with a corresponding issue to add `pprof` and memory usage tests to CI ([#16572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16572)). An active discussion on an `op-supervisor` crash loop due to event overflow ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16335)) led to a PR to add metrics for better debugging.
  - **Core Component Bugs:** Several critical issues remain active, including reports of `op-node` v1.13.3 getting stuck with thousands of goroutines ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16332)) and an incorrect nonce being returned by `eth_getTransactionCount` for pending transactions ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/623)).
  - **Future Work:** Planning for future improvements is underway. New issues were opened to port a suite of acceptance tests to the `devstack` environment ([#412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/412)-[#416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/416)). Discussions are also ongoing to standardize release processes with GoReleaser ([#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16097)) and to clarify terminology by renaming supervisor and op-node modes ([#16379](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16379)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was characterized by deep technical dives from core contributors and engagement from the wider community on usability issues.

- The detailed discussions around `op-supervisor` event overflow ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16335)) and `op-batcher` memory profiling ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16537)) highlight strong, collaborative problem-solving among team members.
- The issue clarifying the distinct use cases for `supersim` and `interop kurtosis devnet` ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/399)) demonstrates a healthy feedback loop between the core team and developers building on the stack.
- An issue to reduce noisy terminal output ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/781)) attracted interest from multiple community members, indicating a welcoming environment for new contributors to pick up "good first issues."
- The coordinated closure of numerous Superchain-Ops issues on June 26th suggests a focused team sprint aimed at reducing technical debt and improving the developer experience for chain operators.
