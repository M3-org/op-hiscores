# ethereum-optimism/infra Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
August was a month of focused stabilization and strategic planning for the Optimism infrastructure. Significant progress was made in hardening core components, with the `op-acceptor` module receiving substantial code refactoring, stability fixes, and dependency updates. A major milestone was achieved with the finalization and ratification of the `min-base-fee` specification. The team also made concrete strides in improving the developer environment by porting several `devnet sdk` tests to Devstack. Discussions around future architectural improvements gained momentum, particularly concerning the deprecation of the `req-resp` P2P sync mechanism in `op-node` and enhancements to CI and documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving the reliability and maintainability of existing infrastructure, with a clear focus on the `op-acceptor` component.

*   **`op-acceptor` Stability and Maintenance:**
    *   A flaky test in the `op-acceptor/runner` module was fixed, enhancing the reliability of the test suite ([#439]).
    *   A major refactoring effort removed approximately 600 lines of unused code from the `op-acceptor` codebase, improving maintainability ([#447]).
    *   A routine dependency update for `github.com/ulikunitz/xz` was performed to keep the component secure and up-to-date ([#451]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month reflected a theme of cleanup and preparation for future work. Numerous long-standing issues were closed, while active discussions laid the groundwork for significant upcoming changes.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Protocol Specification:** The specification for the `min-base-fee` feature was formally written and ratified, marking the completion of a key design phase ([#742]).
    *   **Devstack Test Migration:** Progress was made on improving the test environment, with issues for porting `TestBalanceSnapshot` ([#442]) and `TestInteropReadiness` ([#443]) to Devstack being closed.
    *   **Acceptance Testing Cleanup:** Several issues related to testing infrastructure were resolved. This included closing out acceptance tests for the proofs system ([#15946], [#15948]), streamlining test setup within `op-acceptor` ([#375]), and resolving an issue with missing test logs ([#17151]).
    *   **Infrastructure & System Simplification:** The task to enable Flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers was completed ([#16688]). Issues related to a persistent devnet faucet wallet ([#396]), runbook refactoring ([#347]), and the removal of events from the event system ([#17001]) were also closed, with discussion indicating a broader move to simplify or remove the event system entirely ([#16874]).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **P2P Sync Deprecation:** A significant discussion emerged around deprecating the `req-resp` P2P sync in `op-node` to solve sync instability ([#14108]). A detailed alternative was proposed involving a simpler, centralized driver for gossiping unsafe blocks, which could improve recovery speed and scaling.
    *   **Tooling and CI:** New work was initiated to introduce a GitHub event manager ([#441]) and a consensus-aware proxy poller ([#449]). Discussions are ongoing to improve the CI process for `op-geth` to catch integration issues more quickly ([#665]).
    *   **Developer Experience:** An important discussion continues around creating better documentation and examples for `op-deployer` to assist external chain operators ([#1530]). Additionally, an issue regarding missing content-type headers in RPC responses, which affects developer libraries, remains active ([#389]).
    *   **`Min Base Fee` Implementation:** While the spec is finalized, an active issue tracks the implementation work, with early drafts being shared for review ([#16807]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident in the detailed technical discussions on key architectural issues. The conversation around deprecating `req-resp` P2P sync ([#14108]) involved a thorough proposal from `@emilianobonassi`, demonstrating deep engagement in solving core protocol challenges. Similarly, the finalization of the `min-base-fee` spec ([#742]) and planning for its implementation ([#16807]) involved collaborative input from `wlawt` and `geoknee`.

Team members `alfonso-op`, `bitwiseguy`, and `tess` were noted coordinating on the future of validation testing ([#686]). The effort to improve `op-deployer` documentation ([#1530]) also highlighted active collaboration between team members and feedback from the wider community, underscoring a commitment to improving the developer experience for Superchain builders.
