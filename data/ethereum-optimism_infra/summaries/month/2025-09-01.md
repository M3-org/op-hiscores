# ethereum-optimism/infra Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September was a month of foundational refinement and preparation for future protocol upgrades. Significant progress was made in improving the test infrastructure, particularly with a major refactoring of the `op-acceptor` test runner for better modularity and logging. The project also standardized its tool version management by introducing `mise`. Meanwhile, active discussions centered on integrating the upcoming Kona + Cannon fault-proof system, addressing a critical P2P gossip configuration bug, and enhancing the overall developer experience through CI/CD improvements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on enhancing the project's testing and development tooling.

-   **`op-acceptor` Test Runner Refactoring:** The monolithic `op-acceptor` test runner was significantly refactored into five distinct components, breaking down the large `runner.go` file to improve maintainability and separation of concerns ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/448)).
-   **Enhanced Test Logging:** Complementing the refactor, logging in `op-acceptor` was improved by splitting test outputs into separate plaintext, raw JSON, and summary log files, with the HTML report updated to link to these new formats ([#453](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/453)).
-   **Standardized Tool Version Management:** `mise` was introduced to standardize tool version management across the repository, starting with `op-acceptor`, `op-conductor-mon`, and `op-conductor-ops`. This change aims to streamline the developer setup process project-wide ([#452](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/452)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on resolving testing infrastructure blockers and clarifying component behavior, while new discussions laid the groundwork for supporting future protocol features.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Testing Infrastructure:** Several key testing issues were closed, marking significant progress in test reliability. This includes porting `TestFjord`, `TestSmokeTestFailure`, and `TestInteropSystemNoop` to Devstack ([#440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/440), [#444](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/444)) and completing the effort to get all tests running in persistent devnets ([#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/398)).
    -   **`op-proposer` Behavior:** An issue regarding an `op-proposer` error was closed with a clarification that the `GameAlreadyExists` error is expected behavior when the safe head has not advanced, guiding users to check their batcher configuration ([#17042](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17042)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Kona + Cannon Integration:** A major topic of discussion was the upcoming support for Kona + Cannon fault proofs. Active issues cover the necessary changes in `op-dispute-mon` ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17286)), OPCM ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17285)), and standard prestates management ([#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17283)).
    -   **P2P Gossip Configuration Bug:** A critical bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values, causing panics in `go-libp2p-pubsub`, is under active discussion ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17308)). A proposed solution is to introduce a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to ensure valid configurations are used.
    -   **Developer Experience:** Discussions are ongoing to improve the testability of the CircleCI configuration, including making high-value CI jobs easier to run locally ([#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17184)).
    -   **`op-geth` Initialization Error:** A recurring issue where `op-geth` fails to sync past block 0 during initialization continues to affect users, with no definitive resolution yet identified ([#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/420)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident in the detailed technical discussions on active issues. The P2P gossip bug ([#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17308)) and the planning for Kona + Cannon support ([#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17285), [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17286)) saw significant engagement from core contributors, who debated implementation details and potential solutions. The `op-geth` initialization issue ([#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/420)) highlighted community interaction, with users sharing workarounds and confirming the persistence of the problem. These discussions reflect a healthy, engaged community focused on both immediate stability and long-term strategic goals.
