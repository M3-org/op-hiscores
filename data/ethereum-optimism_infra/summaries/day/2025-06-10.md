# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Jun 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in infrastructure stability with a key feature added to `proxyd` for improved concurrency handling and a critical bug fix in `op-conductor-ops` to ensure robust sequencer bootstrapping.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Concurrency Management in Proxyd
A new feature was implemented in `proxyd` to optimize concurrency handling. Instead of using a semaphore with unlimited weight, the system now bypasses the semaphore entirely when unlimited concurrency is allowed, streamlining performance. This change affects `proxyd/backend.go`, `proxyd/backend_test.go`, `proxyd/config.go`, and `proxyd/proxyd.go`. ([#405](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/405))

### Critical Fix for Op-Conductor-Ops Bootstrap
A bug fix was deployed in `op-conductor-ops` to address an early exit issue during bootstrapping. This ensures that at least one sequencer is active before the bootstrap process exits, improving the reliability of sequencer operations. ([#404](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/404))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#403](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/403), was opened to update the `requests` dependency from version 2.32.3 to 2.32.4 within the `/op-conductor-ops` directory.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes
Discussion on [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15789) continues regarding the necessary changes to support the latest OPCM updates for the Fault Proof creator contract. The latest comment from stevennevins outlines a detailed checklist of tasks, including moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, removing `anchorStateRegistry` from `StandardValidatorOverrides`, unskipping and updating tests in `DeployOPChain.t.sol`, addressing TODO comments, rebasing updates from EVM safety, and fixing Go updates in integration tests.

### Op-Supervisor Event Overflow on Large Unsafe Head Gap
Issue [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16335) addresses a critical problem where the `op-supervisor` can crash-loop due to an event overflow when the unsafe head gap between its log DB and a managed node becomes too large. The discussion highlights `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` as a potential culprit, though `axelKingsley` clarified that these events do not stack up and are responses to `ChainProcess` events. `nonsense` is working on adding a counter per event type to better debug future occurrences and has proposed a PR to add a gauge for in-flight events. `sebastianst` suggested that `"cross-unsafe-update"` events might be the ones stacking up.
