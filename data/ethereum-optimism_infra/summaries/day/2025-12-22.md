# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on infrastructure improvements with new pull requests for graceful server shutdown and migration of Docker builds to GitHub Actions. Progress was also made on an `op-node` light client issue and an `op-challenger` trace output review.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Infrastructure Enhancements
Two new pull requests were opened to improve the project's infrastructure. One introduces a feature for graceful server shutdown in `proxyd` to ensure smoother operations [#533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/533). The other focuses on migrating Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions, streamlining the continuous integration process [#532](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/532).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **feat(proxyd): graceful server shutdown** [#533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/533): This pull request introduces a new feature to enable graceful server shutdown for `proxyd`.
- **ci: complete migration of docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions** [#532](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/532): This pull request aims to finalize the migration of Docker build processes from CircleCI to GitHub Actions.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node` Light Client External Source Following
Issue [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18317) regarding the `op-node` light client following an external source for safe/finalized data saw progress today. The latest comment confirms that the `op-node` implementation for this feature is now complete. The goal is to support the `--l2.follow.source` flag to mirror external safe/finalized feeds, enabling the node to reach the safe/finalized state.

### `op-challenger` Trace Output Review
Discussion continued on issue [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18643) concerning the correct trace output in `op-challenger` when the next super root is not found. The latest update confirms that this functionality now works correctly in the super node trace provider. While `op-supervisor` will not be fixed as it's being deleted, the issue remains open until an integration test confirms `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments highlighted a potential problem where `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash with insufficient data, and questioned the correctness of a specific test case in `op-challenger`. The discussion also touched upon the behavior of the `superRootAtTimestamp` RPC and its reliance on local-safe blocks.
