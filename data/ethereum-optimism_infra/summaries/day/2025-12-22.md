# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Dec 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on infrastructure improvements with new pull requests for graceful server shutdown and migration of Docker builds to GitHub Actions. Progress was also made on an `op-node` light client issue and an `op-challenger` trace output review.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Infrastructure Enhancements
Two new pull requests were opened to improve the project's infrastructure. One introduces a feature for graceful server shutdown in `proxyd` ([#533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/533)), which is crucial for maintaining service availability and data integrity during restarts. The other focuses on migrating Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions ([#532](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/532)), streamlining the CI/CD pipeline and potentially improving build efficiency.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **feat(proxyd): graceful server shutdown** ([#533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/533)): This pull request introduces a new feature to `proxyd` for graceful server shutdown, aiming to improve system stability.
- **ci: complete migration of docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions** ([#532](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/532)): This PR marks the completion of the migration of Docker build processes from CircleCI to GitHub Actions, enhancing the continuous integration workflow.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node` Light Client External Source Following
The issue regarding the `op-node` light client following an external source ([#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18317)) saw a significant update. The latest comment confirms that the `op-node` implementation for this feature is now complete, indicating progress towards enabling the node to mirror external safe/finalized data using the `--l2.follow.source` flag.

### `op-challenger` Trace Output Review
Discussion continued on the `op-challenger` issue concerning the correct trace output when the next super root is not found ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18643)). The most recent comment from ajsutton confirms that the super node trace provider now correctly handles this scenario. It also notes that `op-supervisor` does not require a fix as it is being deprecated. The issue remains open pending an integration test to verify `op-challenger` and `op-program` alignment. Earlier comments from Inphi highlighted this as a real problem, noting that `op-program` transitions to an invalid hash with insufficient data and questioning the correctness of a specific test in `op-challenger`.
