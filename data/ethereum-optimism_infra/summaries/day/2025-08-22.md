### Validation Test Coverage and Strategy
Discussion continued on [#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/686), which addresses the need for improved validation testing to prevent bugs. The latest comment from alfonso-op (Aug 22, 2025) suggests a follow-up chat with @bitwiseguy and Tess to review validation tests marked as "not planned" and determine if any should still be implemented. Earlier comments from alfonso-op (Dec 11, 2024) tasked @bitwiseguy with creating sub-issues for specific validation tests. geoknee (Nov 25, 2024) proposed moving complexity into pure functions in regular `.go` files to formalize them as production code, making them easier to test and improve code coverage. geoknee also highlighted the brittleness of TOML file parsing and the issue of ignoring empty structs, which can lead to easy breakage, referencing [#705](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/705).
