# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Sep 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in infrastructure enhancements, particularly around flashblocks integration and sync-tester capabilities. Several issues related to sequencer configuration and testing environments were closed, indicating a push towards more robust and observable systems.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Sync-Tester Enhancements and Network Exposure
Several issues related to the `op-sync-tester` were closed, indicating progress in setting up and utilizing this tool for L2CL syncing. This includes exposing more networks within the CI environment to facilitate testing with real chain data [#454](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/454) and adding sync acceptance tests using the sync tester [#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16703).
### Mainnet Sequencer Configuration
Work was completed on configuring mainnet sequencers, specifically creating a new sequencer with flashblocks [#17318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17318) and removing an older sequencer as a voter [#17319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17319). This aims to ensure an odd number of voters in the Raft conductor set and optimize for flashblocks integration.
### Acceptance Test Progress
An issue tracking the progress of getting all acceptance tests running and passing in persistent devnets was closed [#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/398). While closed, some follow-up tickets were created for specific failing tests.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerting Improvements
Discussions on [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16388) indicate significant progress in setting up monitoring and alerting for flashblocks. A monitoring dashboard has been completed, and remaining alerting PRs have been raised. This work is crucial for observability and paging when flashblocks are enabled, especially for op-sepolia.
### Nightly CI for Sync Tester
The issue [#17253](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17253) discusses adding nightly CI jobs to test `op-node` (or other CLs) using the sync tester. A recent comment notes that enabling mainnet sync testing is currently blocked by another issue, indicating ongoing work to fully implement this.
