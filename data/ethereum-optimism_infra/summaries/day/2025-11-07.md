## CLOSED ISSUES

### `proxyd` Interop Message Validation Enhancements
Two issues related to `proxyd` interop message validation were closed. These issues, [#364](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/364) and [#365](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/365), focused on load testing, supervisor DoS prevention, and improving observability through instrumentation and metrics.

### Flaky Test Resolution
The issue [#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17548), concerning the flaky `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` in `op-acceptance-tests`, was closed as the test is no longer appearing in the top 100 flaky tests.

## NEW ISSUES

No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-batcher` Max Frame Size in Generic Mode
Discussion on [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17796) revolves around the `op-batcher` not limiting the max frame size to the max input size in generic mode for alternative DA. The latest comment from `nuke-web3` suggests that the Optimism specs might need updating to reflect this change, as the current spec still states a limitation that is now false. Previous comments indicate that a fix was addressed in a pull request to the `optimism` repository.
