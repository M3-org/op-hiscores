### `proxyd` Interop Message Validation
Two issues related to `proxyd` interop message validation were closed. These issues, [#364](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/364) and [#365](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/365), focused on load testing, supervisor DoS prevention, and observability maturity for the interop message validation feature.

No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-batcher` Max Frame Size in Generic Mode
Discussion continued on [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17796) regarding the `op-batcher` not limiting max frame size to max input size in generic mode for altDA. The latest comment from `nuke-web3` suggests that the spec might need updating as the current statement regarding `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` is now considered false. Previously, `tessr` noted that the issue was addressed in a separate pull request, and `sebastianst` had offered to merge a specific commit.

### Flaky `op-acceptance-tests`
Issue [#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17548), concerning the flaky `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` in `op-acceptance-tests`, was closed today. `alfonso-op` confirmed that the test is no longer appearing in the top 100 flaky tests, indicating it has likely been fixed.
