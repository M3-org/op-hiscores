# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Jul 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a critical bug fix in `op-acceptor` to ensure accurate test duration reporting. Several long-standing issues, including those related to sequencer recovery and outdated NPM packages, were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-acceptor` Bug Fixes
A bug in `op-acceptor` was fixed ([#425](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/425)) that previously caused test runs to report zero durations on failed runs. This ensures that test runs now show a non-zero total duration regardless of their result status, improving the accuracy of test reporting.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Test Infrastructure Improvements
An issue related to converting the `ChainFork` test to use `devstack` was closed ([#367](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/367)). This aligns with the team's goal of migrating to `op-devstack` for testing.

### Sequencer Stability and Recovery
Two issues concerning sequencer behavior were closed. One addressed recovery from sequence window expiration incidents ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/11228)), and another focused on sequencer halting due to temporary errors ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/12240)). Both were closed with the note to reopen if the issues persist.

### Dependency Management
An issue requesting an update to the `@eth-optimism/contracts-bedrock` NPM package was closed ([#13459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/13459)). The resolution indicated that these NPM packages are no longer being updated.

### Node Operation Issues
An issue where a new node could not be started with `op-node` was closed ([#15411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15411)), with the assumption that it was resolved.
