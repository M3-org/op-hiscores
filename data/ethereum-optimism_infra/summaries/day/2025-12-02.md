## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `proxyd`: Backwards Time Travel with Unsynced Backends
Discussions on [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/501) continued regarding `proxyd`'s ability to return previous blocks as the `unsafe` block when backends are not in sync, leading to "backwards time travel." The latest comments indicate that a team member plans to focus on this issue starting January 1st, with no additional concerns raised at this time. Previous brainstorming included several approaches such as a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, `proxyd` handling "block out of range" errors by falling back to other backends, and IP-based or signature-based sticky sessions. The most reliable approach (signature-based sticky sessions) would require client-side changes, while other approaches offer drop-in fixes with their own trade-offs in terms of performance and implementation complexity.

### `op-node` Invalid Block Signature
Issue [#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17448) concerning an "op-node invalid block signature unrecognized signer" error encountered during testnet deployment received a new comment from a user experiencing the same problem and seeking a solution. The original issue was created in September and closed later that month, but the recent comment indicates a recurrence or similar problem.
