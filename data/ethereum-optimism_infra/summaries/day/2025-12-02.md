## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `proxyd`: Backwards Time Travel with Unsynced Backends
Discussions on [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/501) continued regarding `proxyd`'s behavior of returning older blocks as `unsafe` when backends are not in sync, leading to "backwards time travel." The latest comments indicate that a team member plans to focus on this issue starting January 1st, with no immediate concerns raised by other contributors. Previous brainstorming included several approaches like a "multicall" strategy for `eth_call` requests, `proxyd` handling "block out of range" errors, and various sticky session implementations (IP-based or signature-based). The most reliable approach (signature-based sticky sessions) would require client-side changes, while others offer drop-in fixes with their own trade-offs in terms of performance or implementation complexity.

### `op-node` Invalid Block Signature
Issue [#17448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17448), concerning an `op-node` invalid block signature error encountered during testnet deployment, received a new comment today. A user reported experiencing the same problem and requested a solution.
