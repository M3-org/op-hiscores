# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Oct 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, a new feature was added to `op-acceptor` to pass environment variables to `go test`, addressing a newly opened issue. Several issues related to `op-acceptor` and the Isthmus upgrade were closed, indicating progress in testing infrastructure and upgrade finalization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced `op-acceptor` Testing Capabilities
A new feature was implemented to allow environment variables passed to `op-acceptor` to be forwarded to `go test`. This enables more flexible and controlled test execution within the `op-acceptor` framework. ([#483](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/483))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#484](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/484), was opened to test modifying CircleCI configurations.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-acceptor` Enhancements and Fixes
Several issues related to the `op-acceptor` testing tool were closed. This includes forwarding environment variables to `go test` ([#482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/482)), improving package parallelism ([#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/462)), and including setup information in HTML output ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/386)).

### Isthmus Upgrade Finalization
The tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/12703)) was closed, with a comment confirming that the Isthmus upgrade is complete.

### L2CL<>L2EL Sync Condition Clarification
An issue investigating the conditions for L2EL to start EL Syncing ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17628)) was closed. The discussion concluded that the EL client should simply sync, and the focus shifted to handling EL Syncs after the initial run.

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-acceptor` Environment Variable Forwarding
A new issue, [#482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/482), was opened to request the `op-acceptor` to forward environment variables to `go test` to allow custom environment variables for test execution.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Cannon Go 1.25 Compatibility
Discussion on [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17060) regarding Cannon's compatibility with Go 1.25 continues. @ajsutton confirmed that the issue affects Optimism, specifically causing incorrect Keccak hashes when running in Cannon with Go 1.25, and provided a link to a detailed diagnosis. @pauldowman linked to the blocking Go issue, and @sebastianst inquired about the impact on Optimism.

### `op-acceptance-test`: Re-integrating `op-reth`
On [#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17475), the discussion around re-adding `op-reth` to the Jovian Kurtosis devnet was updated. @geoknee suggested that since Kurtosis devnet is deprecated, the focus should shift to integrating `op-reth` into the devstack/sysgo system instead.
