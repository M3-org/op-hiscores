# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Jun 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `op-acceptor` with improved HTML reporting and fixing a test flake. Additionally, a critical bug in `proxyd` related to request size limit checks was addressed. An issue concerning the complete withdrawal flow test was closed, and ongoing discussions continued for CI flakiness and incorrect nonce returns.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Reporting and Test Stability
The `op-acceptor` received a new feature to display an overall pass/fail status in its HTML reports, improving clarity and usability ([#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/408)). A persistent test flake in `op-acceptor`'s `TestRealtimeLogs` was also addressed, aiming for more reliable test results ([#409](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/409)).

### `proxyd` Bug Fixes
A significant bug in `proxyd` was fixed, shifting the request size limit check to occur only after interop transaction recognition. This prevents premature checks and ensures correct handling of transactions ([#407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/407)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Withdrawal Flow Test Completion
The issue tracking the complete withdrawal flow test from L2 to L1 was closed today ([#327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/327)). This test, which includes initiation, proof generation, and finalization, has been implemented. Further follow-up tickets are planned for adding `kt` support and executing withdrawals without proof generation.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CI Flakiness Investigation and Improvement
Discussions continued on investigating and improving CI flakiness ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16271)). The latest comment indicates that a test flake report generator has been released and iterated upon, and flakiness is being actively monitored. Previous comments highlighted that most flakiness is due to infrastructure issues rather than acceptance testing itself, with a list of the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests provided.

### Incorrect Nonce Return from `eth_getTransactionCount`
The issue regarding `eth_getTransactionCount` returning an incorrect nonce (0x1 instead of 0x0) for pending transactions was discussed ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/623)). The latest comment from `mukul3097` on June 12, 2025, asks for an update, indicating the problem persists and requires attention. This bug causes transactions to get stuck in the mempool.
