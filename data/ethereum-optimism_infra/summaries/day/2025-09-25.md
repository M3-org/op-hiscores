# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Sep 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing capabilities with a new "flake-shake" runner mode for identifying flaky tests and improving `proxyd` with public access and authentication features. Minor code cleanup was also performed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
A new "flake-shake" runner mode was introduced in `op-acceptor` to identify flaky tests by running them multiple times. This feature generates HTML and JSON reports for CI artifacts, which will be used to aggregate results across multiple runners and improve test reliability [#475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/475).

### `proxyd` Access and Authentication Improvements
The `proxyd` component was updated to enable public access and authentication, enhancing its flexibility and security [#424](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/424).

### Codebase Cleanup
An unused `min` function was removed from `op-acceptor/logging` as Go 1.21 now includes built-in `min` and `max` functions, streamlining the codebase [#476](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/476).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Engine API Validation Deduplication
A new issue was opened to address the duplication of Engine API validation checks within `Miner.prepareWork` that are already performed as part of the Engine API validation in `eth/catalyst/api_optimism.go` [#688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/688). The discussion suggests moving additional checks, such as those for force-included L1 attributes deposit transactions and specific L1 attribute deposit data lengths for Jovian, into the Engine API checks.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-batcher` Preparation for Fusaka
Discussion on preparing `op-batcher` for Fusaka activation continued [#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17472). A comment provided a recipe for manual testing against a Fusaka L1, emphasizing the need for the batcher to send blob transactions with cell proofs instead of blob proofs once Fusaka activates.

### Improved `superchain-ops` Flow
Feedback was provided on the `superchain-ops` signing flow, highlighting several snags and areas for improvement [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1224). Key points from the discussion include:
- The printing of markdown with 'TODOs' during task simulation is intended for task developers to create `VALIDATION.md` files, but it was noted that signers also perform simulations, making it part of their UX.
- The language around audit reports needs to be clarified as their inclusion in the workflow was experimental.
- The necessity of `op-txverify` for all signers is still under consideration.
- Suggestions were made to improve boilerplate markdown files and clarify the meaning of "normalized state diff hash."
- The importance of retaining Tenderly links for non-OPCM upgrades was reiterated.
