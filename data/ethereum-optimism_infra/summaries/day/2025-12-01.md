## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced `op-acceptor` Functionality for Testing
The `op-acceptor` tool received a significant feature update, introducing multi-gate input and a dry-run option. These additions aim to improve the flexibility and testing capabilities of the `op-acceptor`, particularly in handling multiple gate conditions and simulating runs without actual execution. ([#520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/520))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/519), was opened to split CI workflow runs between protected and unprotected branches, aiming to optimize and streamline the continuous integration process.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Decision on ZK Game Challenging Strategy
The issue concerning how to support challenging ZK games was closed, with the decision made to proceed with `op-challenger`. This resolves the discussion around integrating ZK game challenging into existing systems or exploring new solutions. ([#18322](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18322))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Progress on `SuperchainConfig` Type Porting
Discussion continues on [#741](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/741) regarding porting the `SuperchainConfig` type from the `superchain-registry`. The latest update indicates that a PR ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/867)) has been opened by @Himess after incorporating feedback from @emhane regarding the notation for the type definition, moving away from Go syntax towards a more general specification format.
