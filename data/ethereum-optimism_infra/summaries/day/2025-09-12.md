## CLOSED ISSUES

### Devnet and Test Infrastructure Improvements
- The issue regarding scripting permissionless devnet spinup was closed as it has been implemented elsewhere or differently [#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/346).
- An issue related to porting Isthmus withdrawals root Action Tests was closed as Isthmus has already shipped [#168](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/168).
- Issues concerning test retries and returning test stdout & stderr were closed as they are no longer wanted or have been completed [#188](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/188), [#198](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/198).

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-acceptor` Testing Tooling Enhancements
- A bug was reported where the console progress indicator is not showing progress in Kurtosis-based runs [#460](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/460).
- A request was made to log all configuration at start-up and in the HTML report for better reproducibility and debugging [#461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/461).
- An issue was opened to improve package parallelism in `op-acceptor`, as the current implementation is sub-optimal and prevents `t.Parallel()` from working correctly within packages [#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/462).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-geth` CPU Usage and Stability Concerns
- **Abnormal CPU usage with latest op-geth (v1.101511.0)** [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/613): The issue was closed today, with the latest comment suggesting that CPU usage might have decreased after finishing log indexing introduced by Geth 1.15.x. Earlier discussions involved users reporting high CPU usage (up to 50% on a 16-core CPU) with `op-geth` v1.101511.0. It was initially speculated that this was due to a temporary log indexing rebuild process in Geth v1.15.11. Users shared pprof profiles to help diagnose the issue, and some noted that the CPU spike might be related to a database upgrade in the new version.
- **Receipt Correction: Failed to decode RLP receipts (v1.101602.0)** [#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/679): This new issue reports `op-geth` crashing with "Failed to decode RLP receipts" errors during a full sync on op-mainnet using `op-node` v1.13.6. The latest comments indicate that the Optimism team has confirmed experiencing this issue during snap-syncing and is actively investigating it, with a potential fix being tested.
