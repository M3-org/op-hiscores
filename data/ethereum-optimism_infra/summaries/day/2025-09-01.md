### Op-proposer Error Clarification
The issue regarding `op-proposer` errors was closed, with an explanation that the `GameAlreadyExists` error is expected when the safe head has not advanced, meaning there is no new valid proposal. Users are advised to ensure the batcher is running correctly and consider shortening its maximum channel duration for more frequent proposals.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Kona + Cannon: op-dispute-mon support
Discussion continued on supporting Kona + Cannon game types in `op-dispute-mon` ([#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17286)). A comment clarified that `dispute-mon` must return an error for unsupported game types and that an implementation for a game type must be set before it can be created. The need to update `dispute-mon` to specifically support cannon-kana game types was highlighted.
