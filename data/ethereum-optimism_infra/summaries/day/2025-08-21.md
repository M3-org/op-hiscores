# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Aug 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on significant code refactoring within `op-acceptor`, removing unused code and improving efficiency. Several long-standing issues related to acceptance testing, devnet infrastructure, and event system cleanup were closed, indicating progress in stabilizing and streamlining core components.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-acceptor` Codebase Optimization
Extensive refactoring was performed within the `op-acceptor` component, leading to the removal of approximately 600 lines of unused code across various packages, identified through static analysis tools. This cleanup improves maintainability and reduces the codebase's footprint. ([#447](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/447))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Streamlining Acceptance Testing Infrastructure
Several issues related to acceptance testing were closed, including the incorporation of test target setup/teardown as an `op-acceptor` concern ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/375)). This closure was based on the determination that Kurtosis is no longer a primary focus for network testing compared to Sysgo.

### Proofs System Acceptance Test Completion
Key issues concerning interop acceptance testing for the proofs system ([#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15946)) and specific `op-challenger` acceptance tests on interop chains ([#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15948)) were closed. This indicates the completion of acceptance testing for the proofs system, with all sub-issues addressed.

### Devnet Faucet Wallet Implementation
The issue regarding a persistent devnet faucet wallet for `netchef` ([#396](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/396)) was closed, signifying the successful implementation of funded wallets for L2 chains within new persistent devnets.

### Event System Cleanup
An issue to remove two specific events from the event system ([#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17001)) was closed, indicating successful removal and associated PRs in the `optimism` repository.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Contract Verification Improvements
Discussion on contract verification improvements ([#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/14813)) continues, with the latest comment suggesting a future shift to using `forge verify-contract` for verification once forge binary support is implemented. This aims to reduce custom verification code and leverage existing tooling. Previous suggestions included exploring Sourcify for broader integration.
