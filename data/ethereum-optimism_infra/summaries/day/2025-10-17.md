## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **`op-batcher` Preparation for Fusaka**: Discussion on [#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17472) continues regarding the `op-batcher`'s adaptation to Fusaka's activation on L1. The issue was reopened to cover releasing a new batcher version that includes auto-switching to cell proofs and has the mainnet Fusaka time baked in via `op-service` / `op-geth`.
- **`op-batcher` Robust Shutdown for RPC Errors**: The issue [#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17768) addresses the `op-batcher`'s shutdown behavior when the "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" error occurs. The latest thinking suggests maintaining the current detection logic but ensuring the shutdown exits the entire process, leading to a crashloop for automatic recovery when the RPC method becomes available.
