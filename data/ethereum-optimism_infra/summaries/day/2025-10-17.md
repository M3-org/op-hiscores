## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **`op-batcher` Preparation for Fusaka**: Discussion on [#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17472) continues regarding the `op-batcher`'s adaptation to Fusaka. The issue was reopened to cover releasing a new batcher version that automatically switches to cell proofs and includes the mainnet Fusaka activation time via `op-service` / `op-geth`. Previously, manual testing against a Fusaka L1 was outlined.
- **`op-batcher` Shutdown Behavior**: The issue [#17768](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17768) addresses the `op-batcher`'s shutdown behavior when the "SetMaxDASize RPC method unavailable" error occurs. The latest thinking suggests maintaining the current detection logic but ensuring the shutdown exits the entire process, not just part of the batcher. This would allow the batcher to enter a crashloop and automatically recover when the `SetMaxDASize` RPC method becomes available again.
