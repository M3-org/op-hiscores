### Graceful Monitoring and Alerting for Replica-Healthchecks
Discussion on [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17686) centered around a proposed PR to address the issue of monitoring and alerting for multiple replica-healthchecks. A maintainer, yashvardhan-kukreja, clarified that the issue's implementation is intended for the infrastructure end and is currently blocked, not within the scope of `op-conductor`. The PR was closed, with an emphasis on discussing with a maintainer for assignment before making contributions.
