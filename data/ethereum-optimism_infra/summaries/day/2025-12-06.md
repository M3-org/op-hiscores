# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Dec 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a critical bug fix in `op-acceptor` to improve logging efficiency and stability. Discussions continued on several active issues, including potential contributions and debugging synchronization problems.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-acceptor` Logging and Stability Improvements
A significant bug fix was implemented in `op-acceptor` to enhance logging by streaming stdout directly to disk, reducing RAM usage. This update also introduced a signal handler for more graceful exits, improving the overall stability of the component.
- Streams logs directly to disk to conserve RAM.
- Implements a signal handler for graceful application termination.
- Refactors raw JSON logging for better management.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-program`: Bedrock Contracts Test Setup Fails
Discussion continues on an issue where the Bedrock contracts test setup fails due to an incorrect Solady library mapping. A new comment from Himess inquired about taking on the task, indicating potential progress on this audit finding. ([#15220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15220))

### `op-node` Synchronization Issues
An active issue regarding `op-node` v1.16.3 failing to synchronize was discussed. `geoknee` requested more detailed logs and metrics, specifically concerning safe and unsafe heads, and suggested upgrading `op-geth` to v1.101603.5, indicating an ongoing debugging effort. ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18510))

### `op-spammer` Component for Devnets
Discussion on creating a new `op-spammer` component for devnet deployments continued. `scharissis` referenced `flashbots/contender` as prior art, specifically an issue related to it, suggesting potential avenues for implementation. ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18482))

### `isPectra` Removal from Batcher
Himess expressed interest in taking on the task of removing `isPectra` from the batcher, noting that changes would be required across approximately five Go files. This indicates a potential contributor stepping forward for this code simplification. ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18479))

### `IOptimismMintableERC20.bridge` as a View Function
Himess inquired about the status of the issue regarding `IOptimismMintableERC20.bridge` potentially being a `view` function and expressed interest in contributing, suggesting renewed attention to this contract interface clarification. ([#9697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/9697))

### MIPS64Memory Comment Inaccuracies
Himess also inquired about the live status of two issues related to incorrect comments in `MIPS64Memory.sol` and expressed a desire to work on them. These issues, stemming from a Spearbit audit, concern misstated byte sizes and return values in comments. ([#13435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/13435), [#13436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/13436))
