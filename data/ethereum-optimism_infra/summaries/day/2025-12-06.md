# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Dec 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a critical bug fix in `op-acceptor` to improve logging efficiency and stability. Discussions continued on several active issues, including potential contributions and debugging synchronization problems.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-acceptor` Logging and Stability Improvements
A significant bug fix was implemented in `op-acceptor` to enhance its logging mechanism. This update streams stdout directly to disk, reducing RAM usage, and introduces a signal handler for more graceful exits. These changes improve the stability and resource management of the `op-acceptor` component. ([#525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/525))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A dependency update was initiated to bump `urllib3` from version 2.5.0 to 2.6.0 in `/op-conductor-ops`. ([#524](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/524))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-program` Bedrock Contracts Test Setup Failure
Discussion continued on an issue regarding the `op-program` Bedrock contracts test setup failing due to an incorrect Solady library mapping ([#15220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15220)). A new comment from Himess inquired about taking on the task.

### `op-node` Synchronization Issues
An active issue reports that `op-node` v1.16.3 is failing to synchronize for Optimism, Base, and Worldchain deployments ([#18510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18510)). The latest comment from geoknee requested more detailed logs and metrics, specifically regarding safe and unsafe heads, and suggested upgrading `op-geth` to v1.101603.5.

### `isPectra` Removal from Batcher
Himess expressed interest in taking on the task of removing `isPectra` from the batcher, noting that changes would be required in approximately five Go files ([#18479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18479)).

### `op-spammer` Component for Devnets
Discussion on creating a new `op-spammer` component for deployment in devnets continued ([#18482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18482)). scharissis pointed to `flashbots/contender` as prior art, specifically referencing an issue within that project.

### MIPS64Memory Comment Inaccuracies
Himess inquired about the availability of two issues related to incorrect comments in `MIPS64Memory.sol`. These issues concern a comment stating "4 bytes" when it should be "word size" ([#13435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/13435)) and incorrect structured comments about the return value of `readMem` and `readMemUnchecked` ([#13436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/13436)).

### `IOptimismMintableERC20.bridge` as View Function
Himess also asked if the issue regarding `IOptimismMintableERC20.bridge` potentially being a read-only `view` function is available for contribution ([#9697](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/9697)).
