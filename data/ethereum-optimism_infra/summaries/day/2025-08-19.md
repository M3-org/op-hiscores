## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Test Log Visibility
Issue [#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17151) "op-acceptance-tests: Missing test logs" was opened today. The issue describes a problem where CI runs report failed tests, but the corresponding logs are missing. A comment from scharissis clarifies that the "go-tests-short" workflow job is not intended for acceptance tests and that the few sysgo acceptance tests it runs are not executed via `op-acceptor`, which would capture logs. They are actively working on moving these tests, which is expected to resolve the issue.

### Outdated Documentation
Issue [#1673](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1673) "[2024 Q4 Audit] [page-path]" remains open. The issue highlights that the current content on a specific page is outdated and needs to reflect recent developments in the Movement Network, including updates to the MOVE token utility and DAO governance structure. The latest comment from krofax asks for clarification on which page the issue refers to.
