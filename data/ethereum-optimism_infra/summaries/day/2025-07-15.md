# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Jul 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on closing several long-standing acceptance test porting issues and addressing internal infrastructure discussions regarding sequencer configurations and flashblocks. A new pull request was opened to enable public access and authentication.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added. No other work was completed.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#424](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/424), was opened to enable public access and authentication.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Acceptance Test Porting
Three acceptance test porting issues were closed today, indicating successful integration of these tests into the devstack:
- [#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/413) "[acceptance] Port TestChainFork to devstack" was closed as implemented in [#16594](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16594).
- [#412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/412) "[acceptance] Port TestWithdrawalsRoot to devstack" was closed as implemented in [#16547](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16547).
- [#415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/415) "[acceptance] Port TestERC20Bridge to devstack" was closed as ported in [#16695](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16695).

### Infrastructure Spikes and Discussions
Several spike issues related to infrastructure configurations were closed after internal discussions:
- [#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16689) "spike: discuss out the need of nvme node deployment of op-rbuilders" was closed, with the decision to skip NVMe nodes for now based on current flashblocks generation performance.
- [#16690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16690) "spike: discuss out the need of dedicated namespacing of rbuilders" was closed, concluding that it's better to keep flashblocks components in the same namespace as other sequencer components, addressing monitoring gaps with additional labels.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Sequencer Configuration and Flashblocks
- [#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16688) "enable flashblocks on sunnyside sequencers": Discussion indicates that enabling flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers has been deprioritized. The immediate focus is on getting flashblocks stably running on OP Labs Sepolia infrastructure first, with issue [#16685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16685) being a blocker.

### Transaction Pool Behavior
- [#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/635) "txpool: invalid interop tx conditionally included": The discussion highlights a persistent and difficult-to-reproduce bug where invalid interop transactions are occasionally included in the mempool. Despite extensive attempts to reproduce the issue and analysis of the `geth` codebase, the root cause remains elusive. Artifacts from a flaky CI run were provided as evidence of the behavior.
