## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#450](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/450), was opened to address linting within the `op-acceptor` component.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Runbook and Playbook Refactoring
The issue [#347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/347), which aimed to refactor the upgrade runbook to align with the mainnet migration playbook format, was closed.

### Event System and Logging Cleanup
Several issues related to internal system improvements were closed:
- [#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/13543), concerning consensus-influencing event nonces, was closed as it is not currently planned for implementation.
- [#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16874), which proposed adding an event call graph to `op-service`, was closed as similar functionality exists elsewhere and the team is leaning towards removing the entire event system.
- [#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17007), focused on cleaning up logging in `op-up`, was closed due to the complexity of eliminating global logger use in `op-geth`.

### Postmortem and Test Log Resolution
- The issue [#17012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17012), related to a Scalar fix postmortem, was closed as the work had already been completed.
- [#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17151), addressing missing test logs in `op-acceptance-tests`, was closed after the logs were located in root logs.
