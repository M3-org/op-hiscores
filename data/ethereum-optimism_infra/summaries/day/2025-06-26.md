## ACTIVE ISSUES

### GoReleaser for OP Stack Components
Discussion on [#16097](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16097) continues regarding the adoption of GoReleaser for `op-node`, `batcher`, `proposer`, and `challenger` release pipelines. The latest comment from geoknee suggests integrating `git-cliff` with `op-workbench` to automate release note generation, potentially pushing them to GitHub via API. This builds on previous discussions about streamlining release notes and avoiding manual commit reviews, while also addressing concerns about adding another build system without first consolidating existing ones.

### Abnormal CPU Usage with op-geth
Issue [#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/613) concerning abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth` (v1.101511.0) saw new comments. PierrickGT provided a `pprof` profile, noting that the issue might be related to index updates, which took about 24 hours to complete on their system. Jsvisa clarified how to capture `pprof` data and suggested the high CPU usage is temporary due to log indexing rebuilds in the backported `go-ethereum` v1.15.11. Cpuchainorg, however, stated the problem persists even after index upgrades, suspecting a broken goroutine.

### Refactor `signFromChildMultisig`
Issue [#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/781) focuses on reducing noisy terminal output from the `signFromChildMultisig` function in `MultisigTask.sol`. Several community members, including JoseValperga, nsancheznez, and Mau1401, expressed interest in working on this. Cass402 identified the `print` function within `simulateRun` as the primary cause of the excessive logs and proposed removing or commenting it out to improve focus on critical signing information.

### Supersim vs. Interop Kurtosis Devnet
Discussion on [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/399) clarified the differences between `supersim` and `interop kurtosis devnet`. Zhiqiangxu confirmed that `supersim` is primarily for testing dApps, while `kurtosis` is used for testing chains within the OP Stack. Fainashalts explained that `supersim` is a lighter, local tool built around `anvil` for testing multichain/interop applications and upcoming features, used by apps planning to launch with interop.
