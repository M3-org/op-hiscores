# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Jul 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day focused on bug fixes, specifically addressing a flaky test in `op-acceptor`, and logging improvements for transaction errors in `op-ufm`.
## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements
A flaky test in `op-acceptor` was identified and fixed, ensuring more reliable CI/CD runs. This resolves a long-standing issue related to incorrect exit codes for runtime errors.
- Fixed flaky test in `op-acceptor` ([#431](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/431))

### Transaction Error Logging Enhancements
Improvements were made to `op-ufm` to record logs for "transaction not found" errors, which is a preliminary step towards future system changes.
- Recorded logs for transaction not found errors in `op-ufm` ([#433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/433))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#432](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/432), was opened to remove "not found transaction" as an ignorable error, and is currently blocked.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Test Reliability Improvement
A bug related to incorrect exit codes in CI for runtime errors in `op-acceptor` was closed, following the fix implemented in a related pull request.
- Resolved incorrect exit-code in CI for runtime errors ([#244](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/244))

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerting Improvements
Discussion on [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16388) continues to focus on establishing comprehensive monitoring and alerting for flashblocks integration, particularly for op-sepolia. Recent comments from yashvardhan-kukreja outline specific metrics and SLAs for peer count, block progression, pending transactions, and flashblocks-related performance (p99 over time). The discussion also covers monitoring `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` connections and `flashblocks-rpc` node-reth metrics for upstream errors and messages, as well as inheriting alerts and metrics for `op-node-rbuilder`. A related PR in the k8s repo ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/k8s/pull/7162](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/k8s/pull/7162)) was also associated with this issue.
