# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Jul 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw dependency updates and the closure of several issues related to acceptance testing and interop network functionality. A new issue was opened to align acceptance test topology with production environments.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A dependency bump for `golang.org/x/oauth2` from 0.16.0 to 0.27.0 was initiated in the `/op-ufm` directory via [#427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/427).

## CLOSED ISSUES

- **Interop Acceptance Test Resolution:** The acceptance test for interop network functionality, [#298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/298), was closed as it will be handled by the Protocol team.
- **Devstack Test Porting:** The issue concerning porting `TestPectra` to devstack, [#416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/416), was closed, with the implementation noted in a related pull request in the `optimism` repository.

## NEW ISSUES

- **Acceptance Test Topology Alignment:** A new issue, [#16746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16746), was opened to address the discrepancy between the current local Kurtosis interop devnet's public sequencer exposure and the production topology. This aims to make the Kurtosisnet YAML description match production, including components like proxyd and verifier nodes.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **op-acceptance-tests: Handling Failing Tests due to op-geth Version Bump:** Issue [#16731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16731) discusses `TestExecMessageInvalidAttributes` and `TestRegularMessage` failing after an `op-geth` version bump. These tests are currently skipped, and a pull request in the `optimism` repository ([#16735](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16735)) is expected to resolve this.
