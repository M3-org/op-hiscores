## NEW ISSUES

### Batcher Memory Optimization
A new spike issue, [#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16537), was opened to investigate and optimize the `op-batcher`'s memory consumption, especially during periods of L1 congestion. The issue notes that there is likely significant data duplication and copying in the current implementation.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-batcher` Memory Optimization Spike
Discussion on [#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16537) began with a suggestion to run a memory profiler. Subsequent comments detailed a recipe for using `pprof` to identify memory usage, indicating that the compressor is a major contributor to memory consumption when a backlog of channels occurs. Potential optimizations include making the shadow compressor use less memory and more eagerly discarding the compressor after channel submission.

### `op-node` Trivial-Interop Mode
Discussion on [#16519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16519) continued regarding the `op-node` working without a supervisor in trivial interop cases. A comment clarified that the goal is to prevent churn for chain operations by not requiring a supervisor for trivial depsets, especially in the coming months, with the expectation of a better `op-supervisor` and `op-node` implementation by the time interop merging is fully implemented.

### Redundant Assertions Removal
Discussion on [#16362](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16362) outlined a two-phase approach to remove redundant assertions. The plan involves first removing checks from `Deploy*.s.sol` scripts that are already present in `ChainAssertions.sol`, and then moving the checks from `ChainAssertions.sol` into the `StandardValidator`. If codesize limits are exceeded, a child contract will be used to house some checks.
