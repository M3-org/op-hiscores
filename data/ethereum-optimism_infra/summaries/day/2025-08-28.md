## ACTIVE ISSUES
### CI Enhancements for `op-geth` Integration
Discussion on [#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/665) revolves around improving the CI process for `op-geth` PRs. The latest comment from ajsutton suggests a "Option C" involving a periodic job in the monorepo to check for the latest `op-geth` commit from the optimism branch, notifying via Slack if it fails. This aims to quickly alert to integration issues, though it might produce false alarms.

### Documentation for `op-deployer`
The ongoing discussion in [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1530) focuses on creating an example for deploying an OP Stack Rollup testnet using `op-deployer`. The most recent comment from krofax highlights a "rich PR" ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705/](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/docs/pull/1705/)) that overhauls the existing documentation for `op-deployer`. Earlier comments from Chomtana pointed out the current mixed-up state of documentation, making it difficult for external chain operators. Visheshgpt noted a high number of RPC calls on Alchemy when using the permissioned fault-proof system, primarily from the challenger.

### Flashblock Tests for Persistent Devnets
Issue [#17248](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17248) discusses enabling flashblock tests against persistent devnets. Stevmark11's comment reiterates that the gate for these tests is already in place, and the primary task is to ensure correct functionality.
