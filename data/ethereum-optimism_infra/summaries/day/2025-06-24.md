# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Jun 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in `op-acceptor` development with the addition of first-class orchestrator support. Several acceptance test porting issues were opened, and an issue related to CI flakiness was closed after improvements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Orchestrator Support for `op-acceptor`
- Added support for both `op-devstack` orchestrator modes, enabling `op-acceptor` to run in-memory tests. ([#411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/411))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### CI Flakiness Investigation and Improvement
- The issue tracking CI flakiness was closed, with significant progress made in identifying and improving test stability, including the release of a test flake report generator. ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16271))

### Documentation Update for ERC-20 Bridging
- The documentation issue regarding bridging ERC-20 tokens with Viem was closed, as a PR addressing the complete implementation for token bridging using Viem was merged. ([#1508](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1508))

### Deterministic Gas Testing Feature Request
- A feature request to enable deterministic gas testing by setting a fixed base fee was closed, with discussion indicating that adapting tests to query the base fee might be a more suitable approach. ([#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/408))

## NEW ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Porting to Devstack
- New issues were opened to port various acceptance tests to the devstack environment, including `TestChainFork`, `TestWithdrawalsRoot`, `TestOperatorFee`, `TestERC20Bridge`, and `TestPectra`. ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/413), [#412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/412), [#414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/414), [#415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/415), [#416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/416))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node v1.13.3: Stuck Goroutines in p2p.SyncClient / libp2p
- Users continue to report issues with `op-node` v1.13.3 experiencing thousands of stuck goroutines, primarily in `select`, `IO wait`, or `yamux` session handlers, leading to sync problems. The issue persists for several hours of uptime. ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16332))

### Spike: CI SLAs
- Discussion around implementing CI SLAs is ongoing. Feedback suggests that while metrics are useful, some proposed SLAs (like PR merge time) might not be directly attributable to CI. There's also a strong sentiment against disabling tests and a preference for smarter ways to admit new tests to prevent flakiness. The issue is expected to be closed soon without immediate implementation of CI SLAs. ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16437))
