# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Sep 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw the closure of two significant issues related to op-batcher metrics and op-geth genesis file handling. Additionally, two new issues were opened concerning improved logging and progress indicators for `op-acceptor`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, tests, or other work were completed today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### op-batcher Throttling Metric Improvement
The issue concerning the `op-batcher`'s throttling intensity metric was closed today [#17149](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17149). The resolution involved updating the Grafana dashboard to only plot values greater than 0, making it easier to visualize active controllers.

### op-geth Large Genesis File Handling
The issue regarding `op-geth` initialization with large genesis files and leveldb panics was closed [#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/668). The discussion provided a strategy to handle large genesis files by not storing the alloc data as a flat JSON blob and instead including the `stateHash` attribute in the genesis block's chain-config.

## NEW ISSUES

### op-acceptor Logging Enhancements
Two new issues were opened to improve the logging and progress indicators within `op-acceptor`. These include a general improvement to logging to better show test state [#455](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/455) and a specific enhancement to the progress indicator to improve user experience during test runs [#456](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/456).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis: Ability to use local op-geth build
Discussion continued on the ability to use a local `op-geth` build with Kurtosis [#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16975). The latest suggestion proposes leveraging the templating system to automatically override the `op-geth` image. This could involve resolving to a Docker image constructed from the githash in `go.mod` or allowing the source code to be cloned and a local Docker image built.
