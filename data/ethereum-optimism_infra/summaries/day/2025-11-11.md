# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Nov 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on addressing and debugging an installation error related to 'mise' within the infrastructure repository, with one fix implemented and another debugging step added.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `mise` Installation Fixes
A fix was implemented to resolve an issue where `mise install` was failing due to a missing 'asterisc' component, by adopting a pattern from the Optimism monorepo ([#507](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/507)). Additionally, verbose logging was added to the `mise` installation process in CircleCI to aid in debugging a persistent error ([#506](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/506)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#508](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/508), was opened to address a `mise` installation error.
