# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Nov 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on addressing installation issues related to `mise` within the `infra` repository, including a fix for a specific installation error and the addition of debug logging to aid in troubleshooting.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `mise` Installation Fixes
A bug preventing `mise install` from completing successfully due to a missing dependency was resolved. This fix aligns the `infra` repository's `mise` configuration with a pattern used in the `optimism` monorepo, aiming for more robust installations [#507](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/507).

### Debugging Enhancements for CI
To further diagnose and resolve `mise` installation failures, verbose logging was enabled for `mise` installations within the CircleCI configuration. This provides more detailed output for debugging purposes [#506](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/506).
