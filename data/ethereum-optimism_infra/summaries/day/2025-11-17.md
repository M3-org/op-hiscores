## CLOSED ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Suite Enhancements
A series of acceptance tests for the base layer were closed, indicating a potential completion or deprecation of these specific test cases. These include tests for block proposal and finalization latency ([#333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/333)), node failure and recovery ([#334](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/334)), transaction type support ([#335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/335)), cross-domain message passing ([#329](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/329)), bridge functionality under network congestion ([#330](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/330)), L1 data availability validation ([#331](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/331)), transaction throughput measurement ([#332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/332)), and contract verification ([#345](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/345)).

### Resolution of Aged Bug Reports
Several older issues were closed due to their age or deprecation of related systems. This includes a fix for the `op-devstack` sysext address book ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15817)), divergence in L2 networks during reorg tests ([#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15782)), and an `op-node` issue with stuck goroutines in `p2p.SyncClient` ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16332)). Additionally, an issue regarding Engine API status/error return values ([#596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/596)) and `op-geth` full node state DB corruption ([#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/549)) were closed due to age.

### Flaky Test Resolution and Parallelization
A flaky test related to `TestChannelManager_Memory/ShadowCompressor_Zlib_SingularBatch` ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17966)) was closed as it has not been observed recently. The issue to parallelize the "memory-all" job in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17525)) was also closed as it is no longer needed.

### Flaky Test Investigation
The flaky test `TestMissingBatchE2E` ([#18138](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18138)) was closed.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Min-Base-Fee Feature Relevance
Discussions continue on the relevance of conducting simulations for the `min-base-fee` feature ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16958)) and creating a runbook for low batcher throughput related to `min-base-fee` ([#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16959)). @mslipper questioned the current relevance of these issues to @geoknee.

### `op-reth` Integration into Devnet
The issue of adding `op-reth` back to the Jovian `kt-devnet` ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17475)) is still active. @mslipper inquired about its relevance to @geoknee and @theochap, following @geoknee's previous comment suggesting integration into `devstack` / `sysgo` instead, due to the deprecation of `kurtosis devnet`.

### Flaky Test: `TestBreakTimestampInvariant`
The flaky test `TestBreakTimestampInvariant` ([#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18137)) remains open, with @mslipper providing an example failure link for further investigation.
