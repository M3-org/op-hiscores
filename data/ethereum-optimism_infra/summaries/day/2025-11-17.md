# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Nov 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in closing out several long-standing acceptance testing issues, particularly those related to `op-devstack` and general test suite stability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Suite Enhancements
Several acceptance tests related to core Optimism functionality were closed, indicating a potential completion or deprecation of these testing initiatives. These include tests for block proposal and finalization latency, node failure and recovery, transaction type support, cross-domain message passing, bridge functionality under network congestion, L1 data availability validation, transaction throughput measurement, and contract verification, all utilizing `op-devstack` for implementation. ([#333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/333), [#334](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/334), [#335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/335), [#329](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/329), [#330](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/330), [#331](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/331), [#332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/332), [#345](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/345))

### Test Stability and Deprecation
Multiple issues concerning test flakiness and outdated testing infrastructure were closed. This includes the deprecation of the "KT" devnet, resolution of a flaky `TestChannelManager_Memory` test, and the closure of an issue regarding parallelizing the "memory-all" job in `op-acceptance-tests`. ([#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15782), [#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17525), [#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17966))

### Infrastructure Stability and Maintenance
Older issues related to `op-node` goroutine issues, `op-geth` state DB corruption, and Engine API specification compliance were closed due to age or presumed resolution in newer releases. ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16332), [#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/549), [#596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/596))

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-devstack`: sysext address book fix
Issue [#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15817) remains active, with a recent comment from @ajsutton indicating that the issue is being reopened due to remaining TODOs. The issue concerns updating hardcoded address keys in `op-devstack/sysext/addrbook.go` following an update to the KT local devnet description.

### `min-base-fee` Feature Effectiveness and Runbook
Issues [#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16958) and [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16959) are still active, with @mslipper inquiring about their current relevance to @geoknee. These issues focus on conducting simulations to prove the effectiveness of the `min-base-fee` feature and creating a runbook for low batcher throughput scenarios.

### `op-reth` Integration into `op-acceptance-test`
Issue [#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17475) is active, with @mslipper asking @geoknee and @theochap about its relevance. The issue tracks the integration of `op-reth` into the `op-acceptance-test` suite once it supports the `min-base-fee` feature, with a note that since Kurtosis devnet is deprecated, `op-reth` should be integrated into the devstack/sysgo system instead.

### Flaky Test: `TestBreakTimestampInvariant`
Issue [#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18137) is active, with @mslipper providing an example failure link. This issue tracks a flaky test related to timestamp invariants.
