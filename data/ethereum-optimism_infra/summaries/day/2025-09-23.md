# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Sep 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on improving the `op-acceptor`'s logging and reporting capabilities, with several bug fixes implemented to enhance output capture and parsing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced `op-acceptor` Logging and Reporting
Improvements were made to the `op-acceptor`'s logging and reporting mechanisms. This included fixing the parser to capture subtest stdout output, handling plain text output when JSON parsing fails, ensuring HTML report links match actual created files, and adding file existence checks. These changes aim to provide more robust and accurate logging and reporting for the `op-acceptor` component. ([#474](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/474))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Flashblocks on Sunnyside Sequencers
The issue [#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16761) regarding enabling flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers was closed today. The latest comment from yashvardhan-kukreja confirms the completion of this task, referencing a related pull request in the `k8s` repository. Previously, updates indicated that both Sunnyside sequencers had `op-rbuilder` deployed and synced, with next steps including deploying `rollup-boosts` in disabled mode and a backup sequencer without flashblocks, followed by enabling `execution_mode` based on flashblock health.
