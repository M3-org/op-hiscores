# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Sep 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the stability of `proxyd` with a critical bug fix for a multicall test flake. Additionally, a long-standing issue regarding address struct duplication was closed, and a new issue was opened to standardize network upgrade transaction conventions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `proxyd` Stability Improvements
A bug fix was implemented to address a flaky multicall test in `proxyd`. This involved modifying the `nodeBackendRequestCount` function to utilize the thread-safe `Requests()` method, ensuring more reliable test execution and overall stability for the `proxyd` component. ([#472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/472))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Address Struct Standardization
The issue concerning the duplication of address structs across various packages, such as `op-deployer/op-chain-ops` and `interopgen`, has been closed. The intended scope of this work was completed, aiming to create a single source of truth for these critical structs. ([#14977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/14977))

## NEW ISSUES

### Network Upgrade Transaction Convention
A new issue has been opened to establish a new convention for Network Upgrade Transactions that involve deploying new contracts. The current practice of choosing a unique `from` address with `nonce=0` affects deployment addresses, and the issue seeks to enshrine a more robust and standardized approach. ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/781))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Enshrine new convention for Network Upgrade Transactions which deploy new contracts ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/781))
Discussion on this newly opened issue primarily revolves around ensuring address collision resistance for the proposed new convention. @protolambda provided a detailed analysis comparing `CREATE`, `CREATE2`, and the suggested upgrade source-hash computations, concluding that the start of the keccak preimage always differs, preventing collisions. They also suggested an extra-safe approach using `CREATE2` computation with a system address as the deployer and the source-hash as a salt, integrating it into existing address computation frameworks and preventing user collisions.
