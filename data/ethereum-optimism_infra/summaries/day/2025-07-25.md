# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Jul 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on refining transaction handling within the `op-ufm` package, with a specific update to functionally ignore not found transactions. Additionally, two long-standing issues related to supervisor target resets and logger utility were closed, indicating progress in addressing technical debt. A new issue was opened concerning configurable test skips in `op-acceptor`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Transaction Handling Improvements:**
    *   Implemented a change to functionally ignore "not found" transactions within the `op-ufm` package, specifically affecting `heartbeat.go` and `roundtrip.go`. ([#437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/437))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened on this day.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Supervisor Target Reset Refinement:**
    *   The issue concerning improving the `op-supervisor` and `op-node`'s reset unsafe target mechanism was closed. This issue aimed to enhance how the supervisor determines and requests reset targets from the node. ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16314))
*   **Logger Utility Enhancement:**
    *   The issue related to creating a more reusable logger utility in `op-service` for changing sub-logger log levels was closed. This aimed to provide better control over log levels for different components. ([#15139](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15139))

## NEW ISSUES

*   **Configurable Test Skips:**
    *   A new acceptance issue was opened to allow configurable skips in `op-acceptor`, addressing the current behavior where skipped tests are counted as failures. This aims to provide flexibility for users who prefer skips to remain as such. ([#434](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/434))
