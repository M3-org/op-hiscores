## CLOSED ISSUES

### `minBaseFee` Implementation Completed
Several issues related to the `minBaseFee` feature have been closed, indicating the completion of its implementation. This includes adding `minBaseFee` to the block header's `extraData` field [#649](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/649), adding an extra `uint64` for `minBaseFee` in `PayloadAttributesV3` [#650](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/650), and updating `eip1559.CalcBaseFee` to enforce the minimum if the feature is active [#651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/651). These changes were implemented via https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/pull/666.

### `op-nat` Kurtosis Integration Deprioritized
The issue of running `op-nat` in Kurtosis [#158](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/158) has been closed. The decision was made to close this request due to a shift in prioritizing other local devnet environments.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Large Genesis File Initialization and LevelDB Panic [#668](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/668)
Discussion continued regarding an `op-geth` initialization issue with a large 7GB genesis file leading to a LevelDB panic. The latest comment from @protolambda suggests that the Genesis-State-Spec (the "alloc" part of `genesis.json`) is optional and doesn't need to be stored in `geth`. It's recommended to modify `op-geth` for a one-time import of state by not storing the alloc data as a flat JSON blob and still importing the state into the DB. Additionally, including the `stateHash` attribute of the genesis block into the chain-`config` part of `genesis.json` is advised to allow fresh nodes to start with an empty DB and valid genesis-block header, enabling snap-sync from bootstrap nodes. This approach mirrors how `op-mainnet` operates to avoid excessively large `op-geth` binaries or Docker images.

### Superchain: Make Chain Configs Fully Explicit [#763](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/763)
A question was raised by @alfonso-op regarding the status of making chain configurations self-descriptive. The issue aims to ensure that `ChainConfig` .toml files contain the complete set of config values, rather than relying on inheritance logic within the `superchain` package. @alfonso-op inquired if this task has already been completed, suggesting the possibility of closing the issue.
