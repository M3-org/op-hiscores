# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Sep 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on improving RPC metric reporting within the `proxyd` component, specifically enhancing error categorization for Prometheus. Discussions continued on active issues, including flakiness in `op-acceptance-tests` and a token bridging query.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### RPC Metric Improvement
A bug fix was implemented to refine RPC metrics, changing "unknown" error states to "method_not_allowed" for better Prometheus reporting. This enhancement improves the observability and debugging capabilities of the `proxyd` service. ([#465](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/465))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Addressing `op-acceptance-tests` Flakiness
Discussions continued regarding the flakiness of `TestPreNoInbox` in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17298)). A recent comment confirmed that a proposed fix in `optimism/pull/17495` did not resolve the issue, indicating further investigation is needed. Another flake was observed and linked.

### Token Bridging Clarification
An active discussion is ongoing regarding a token bridging issue related to PR #1184 ([#1203](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1203)). A maintainer clarified that the `superbridgeapp` is not responsible for this repository and suggested that the token in question might not be an `OptimismMintableERC20`, which could explain why a bridge address was not included. Verification of the token's implementation was recommended.

### `protocol/system-config.md` Cleanup
Work continues on cleaning up the `protocol/system-config.md` documentation ([#771](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/771)). A suggestion was made to include both the numerical and canonical names for config update enums (e.g., `MIN_BASE_FEE` and `6`) and to link to fork-specific specs for hard fork-added config updates.
