## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Celestia Batcher DA Size Fix Investigation**
Discussion on [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17872) indicates that a fix for the Celestia batcher DA size issue has been identified and a pull request ([#18074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074)) has been opened in the `optimism` repository to address it, making the issue trivial to resolve.

**Jovian Rollup Config Field Handling**
Issue [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17907) continues to be active, with recent comments highlighting that new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` are still causing breakage for zk stacks like op-succinct and kailua. A new `kona` release (v1.2.0) is now available that supports Jovian. The discussion also touched upon the need for better versioning or expectations around RPC method bodies to prevent breaking changes for third-party integrations.

**Resolving Race Conditions in `op-devstack`**
Discussions on [#18063](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18063) focused on addressing race conditions arising from the misuse of `dsl.EOA` in acceptance tests. It was suggested that tests should fund new, unique wallets for isolation, rather than sharing `dsl.EOA` instances. The limitations of parallelizing certain tests and the role of `op-acceptor` in managing test execution were also discussed.

**Skipping L1 Chain Config for L3s**
Issue [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18070) discusses the need for `op-node` and `op-program` to skip L1 chain configuration for L3s. A suggestion was made to automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID and apply the L3 behavior, similar to how L1 mainnet and sepolia are recognized.
