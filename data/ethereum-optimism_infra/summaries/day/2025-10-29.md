## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Addressing Rollup Configuration Compatibility for ZK Stacks
Discussion on [#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17907) continues regarding the marshaling of new fields in `rollupConfig.Genesis.SytemConfig` which is breaking zk stacks like op-succinct and kailua. A new field, `daFootprintGasScalar`, was identified as causing further breakage. The team is exploring solutions, including potential versioning or clearer expectations for RPC method body stability, and a new Kona release (v1.2.0) is now available that is Jovian-ready.

### Resolving Race Conditions in `op-devstack` Acceptance Tests
Issue [#18063](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18063) highlights race conditions in `op-devstack` acceptance tests due to the abuse of `dsl.EOA`. The discussion centers on strengthening the `*dsl.EOA` abstraction or using faucets to fund new, unique wallets for each test to ensure isolation. The idea of a custom test runner like `op-acceptor` is also being considered to manage EOA ownership and test parallelization.

### Streamlining L1 Chain Configuration for L3s
The necessity to provide `op-node` and `op-program` with L1 chain configuration for L3s is being discussed in [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18070). The team is considering automatically detecting known L2 chain IDs as L1s for L3s, similar to how Mainnet and Sepolia are recognized, to simplify the configuration process.

### Investigating Upstreaming Celestia Batcher DA Size Fix
Issue [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17872) discusses investigating and potentially upstreaming a fix from Celestia for a batcher DA size issue. A PR ([#18074](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18074)) has been opened to address this, indicating a swift resolution to the problem.
