# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in closing out several long-standing issues related to Superchain Registry validations, Kurtosis investment, and Jovian upgrade finalization. New development focused on `proxyd` enhancements with features for IP verification and configurable block ranges.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `proxyd` Enhancements
Two new features were introduced for `proxyd`: one to verify if the last XFF IP matches the client IP, and another to allow configuration of the maximum block range. These additions aim to improve security and flexibility for proxy operations.
- [#495](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/495)
- [#494](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/494)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#495](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/495) feat(proxyd): verify last XFF IP matches client IP: This PR introduces a new feature to `proxyd` that verifies if the last IP in the X-Forwarded-For header matches the client's IP address, enhancing security.
- [#494](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/494) feat(proxyd): max block range config: This PR adds a configuration option to `proxyd` for setting the maximum block range, providing more control over proxy behavior.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Registry Validation Improvements
Several issues related to Superchain Registry validations were closed, indicating a shift towards a report-based approach rather than blocking validations. This includes changes to how all chains are validated on PRs and the removal of genesis validation checks for frontier chains.
- [#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/689)
- [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/696)

### Jovian Upgrade Finalization
Two issues concerning the Jovian upgrade were closed, confirming the finalization of the upgrade transactions' bytecode and the `daFootprintGasScalar` default value. This marks a significant step in the Jovian upgrade process.
- [#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/772)
- [#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/773)

### Development Tooling and Infrastructure Decisions
Decisions were made to close issues related to Kurtosis and Interopgen. The Kurtosis issue was closed due to a shift in investment, and the Interopgen issue was closed as it's no longer needed for new tests.
- [#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16975)
- [#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17614)

### Developer Experience Enhancements
An issue regarding the addition of a Sepolia ETH faucet to the Protocol R&D Discord was closed, with the rationale that the team is moving away from Discord and account funding is now in scope for devnet efforts.
- [#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/12952)

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dispute Game Contract Updates
Issue [#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17267) "Update OPCMStandardValidator to handle new dispute game contracts" was reopened today. The latest comment from ajsutton indicates that despite previous work, the tests are still skipped when V2 of the dispute game contracts is enabled, necessitating further attention.

### DA Footprint Limit Investigation
Issue [#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17946) "[DA Footprint Limit] Investigate why block right after genesis still has 0 gas scalar" received an update from sebastianst. The issue has been identified as being caused by how the first block's L1 block attributes were populated from the genesis SystemConfig, which could have a zero scalar that wasn't translated. A fix has been implemented in PR #17947.
