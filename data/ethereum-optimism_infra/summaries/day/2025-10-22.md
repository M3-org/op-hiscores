# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in closing out several long-standing issues related to Superchain validation, Kurtosis, and Jovian upgrade specifications, alongside new feature development for proxyd.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new feature for proxyd was opened to verify the last XFF IP matches the client IP ([#495](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/495)).
- Another proxyd feature was initiated to add max block range configuration ([#494](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/494)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Validation and Registry Improvements
Several issues related to Superchain validation and the registry were closed. This includes moving away from Discord for Sepolia ETH faucets and focusing on devnet efforts ([#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/12952)), closing issues related to validating all chains on PRs and not running genesis validation checks for frontier chains due to a shift to report-based approaches rather than blocking validations ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/689), [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/696)).

### Kurtosis and Interopgen Deprecation
The issue regarding the ability to use local op-geth build with Kurtosis was closed as investment in Kurtosis is no longer ongoing ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16975)). Similarly, the issue to rewire interopgen config was closed as "won't fix," as interopgen is only used by op-e2e, and new tests are now added as acceptance tests ([#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17614)).

### Jovian Upgrade and Dispute Game Updates
Issues related to the Jovian upgrade were finalized, including updating the upgrade transactions' bytecode and the `daFootprintGasScalar` default value, which has been settled at 400 ([#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/772), [#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/773)). The issue to update OPCMStandardValidator to handle new dispute game contracts was reopened after initially being closed, as tests are still skipped when V2 is enabled ([#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17267)).

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### DA Footprint Limit Investigation
The issue "[DA Footprint Limit] Investigate why block right after genesis still has 0 gas scalar" ([#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17946)) is active. The latest comment indicates that the issue has been identified. It was caused by how the first block's L1 block attributes were populated from the genesis SystemConfig, which could have a 0 scalar that was not translated. A fix has been implemented in PR #17947.
