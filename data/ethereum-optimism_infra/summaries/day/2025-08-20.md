### RPC Response Content Type
The issue [#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/389), "OP Chain A and B rpc response for eth rpc queries is missing content type," saw a new comment from OBlackmon3 at 2025-08-20T17:43:20Z asking how to suggest a fix for the problem. The issue describes that RPC responses for `eth_getTransactionByHash` and `eth_getTransactionReceipt` are missing content type headers, potentially affecting how libraries like Wagmi read transaction receipts.
