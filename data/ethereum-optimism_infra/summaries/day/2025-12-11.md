## ACTIVE ISSUES
A new issue, [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18581), titled "the node is not synchronized," was opened and quickly garnered significant discussion. Users reported encountering "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors across multiple nodes on Base, Optimism, and Unichain, particularly when using `op-geth` and syncing with snapshots from publicnode.com. There's speculation that Optimism and Arbitrum might be experiencing downtime, with some suggesting a client update is needed. One user noted that while Publicnode snapshots caused issues, `syncmode=execution-layer` worked for syncing a new Unichain node. The latest comment from rdin777 on Dec 15, 2025, indicates that the errors likely point to the L1 Execution Client failing to provide necessary state data to Op-Node for L2 block creation. To diagnose, rdin777 requested detailed information on client configurations (L1 Execution Client, L1 Consensus Client), full logs for Op-Node and L1 Execution Client, and the full list of flags used for all three clients.
