### Node Synchronization Failures
A critical issue, [#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18581), was reported concerning nodes failing to synchronize, displaying errors like "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload." This problem appears to be widespread, affecting Optimism, Base, and Unichain nodes. Initial reports suggest that using Publicnode snapshots might be contributing to the issue, though one user noted that `snapsync` with `--syncmode=execution-layer` worked for a new Unichain node. There's speculation that a client update might be necessary to resolve the problem. The issue was created on December 11, 2025, and has garnered significant attention, with multiple users confirming similar experiences.
