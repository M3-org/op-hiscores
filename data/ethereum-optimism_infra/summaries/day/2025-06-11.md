## NEW ISSUES
### Core Infrastructure Development
- A new issue was opened to track the development of the Gas Tank contract, which is a key component for managing gas consumption within the Optimism ecosystem [#836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/836).

### Interoperability and Naming Conventions
- An issue was created to address the renaming of supervisor and op-node modes within the `interop` package, aiming to clarify terminology and reduce confusion based on an internal naming convention document [#16379](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16379).

### Test Reliability Improvements
- An issue was opened to improve the reliability of acceptance tests, specifically targeting flakiness to ensure consistent and accurate test results [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16378).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Improving Acceptance Test Reliability [#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16378)
Discussions on this issue revolve around identifying and mitigating flakiness in acceptance tests. The goal is to achieve 100% consistent, single-shot passes for all tests. Initial findings indicate that `op-acceptance-tests/tests/interop/reorgs` package passes with `-count=5`, suggesting it's not currently actionable. However, the `op-acceptance-tests/tests/interop/sync/multisupervisor_interop` package appears flaky, specifically `TestUnsafeChainUnknownToL2CL` and `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor`. It was noted that measuring flakiness by package rather than by individual test is important, as tests sharing the same environment can interfere and boost flakiness. The issue was later closed on July 9, 2025, with a note that tests have been considerably improved, emphasizing continuous monitoring and improvement of CI and tests to prevent new flakiness.

### Interop: Supervisor <> Op-Node Mode Renaming [#16379](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16379)
This issue focuses on renaming supervisor and op-node modes to improve clarity and reduce confusion, following an internal naming convention. A comment highlighted a potential mix-up regarding the instruction to replace "standard mode" with "indexing mode," which was also mentioned in a separate PR [#16385](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/16385).

### Gas Tank Contract [#836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/836)
A pull request for the Gas Tank contract has been opened at `https://github.com/defi-wonderland/optimism/pull/414`.
