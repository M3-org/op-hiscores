# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Oct 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `proxyd` service with a new configuration for limiting block ranges in RPC requests. Additionally, several documentation-related issues were closed, and discussions continued on optimizing the `op-batcher` for alternative DA solutions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `proxyd` Service Enhancements
A new feature was added to `proxyd` to allow configuration of a maximum block range for potentially expensive RPC requests like `eth_getLogs`. This aims to improve performance and prevent abuse by limiting the scope of such queries. ([#494](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/494))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#498](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/498), was opened to address and fix some incorrect comments within the codebase.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation Link Fixes
Several issues related to broken internal links and outdated information within the documentation were addressed and closed. This includes fixes for general documentation issues ([#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1797)) and specific broken internal links in tutorials ([#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1802)).

### Flashblocks Timeout Resolution
An issue concerning a 30-second timeout on the Flashblocks websocket URL, attributed to Cloudflare and GCP interference, has been resolved. ([#17858](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17858))

### Audit-Related Documentation
An internal audit-related issue concerning a specific page path has been closed. ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1789))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-batcher` Max Frame Size for AltDA
Discussion continues on issue [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17796) regarding the `op-batcher`'s max frame size when using alternative DA solutions. The latest comment from sebastianst suggests that a PR with a specific commit from `celestiaorg/optimism` would be merged to address the bug where the `op-batcher` incorrectly limits the max frame size to the max input size in generic commitment mode, contrary to specifications.

### Upstreaming Celestia Batcher DA Size Fix
Issue [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17872) is actively being investigated to upstream a fix from Celestia for the batcher DA size. sebastianst reviewed the proposed fix, found it to be good and trivial, and has requested the Celestia team to open a pull request.
