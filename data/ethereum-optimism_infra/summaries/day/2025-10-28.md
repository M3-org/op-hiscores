# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Oct 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `proxyd` service with a new configuration for limiting block ranges in RPC requests, aiming to improve efficiency and prevent expensive queries. Several documentation-related issues were closed, and discussions continued on an `op-batcher` issue related to alternative DA.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `proxyd` Block Range Configuration
A new feature was added to `proxyd` to allow configuration of a maximum block range for RPC requests like `eth_getLogs`. This aims to limit potentially expensive queries and improve performance. ([#494](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/494))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#498](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/498), was opened to fix some incorrect comments in the codebase.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation Link Fixes
Several issues related to broken internal links and outdated documentation were closed. This includes fixes for issues found in the `/get-started/interop` path and broken internal links within tutorials. ([#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1797), [#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1802))

### Flashblocks Timeout Resolution
An issue concerning a 30-second timeout on the Flashblocks websocket URL, attributed to Cloudflare-GCP interference, was reported as fixed. ([#17858](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17858))

### Audit-Related Documentation
An internal audit-related issue concerning a page path was closed. ([#1789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1789))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-batcher` Max Frame Size for AltDA
Discussion continued on an issue regarding the `op-batcher` not limiting the max frame size to the max input size in generic mode for alternative DA. A comment from `sebastianst` suggested opening a PR with a specific commit from `celestiaorg/optimism` to address this. ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17796))

### Upstreaming Celestia Batcher DA Size Fix
This issue is closely related to [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17796). `sebastianst` reviewed Celestia's fix and found it to be trivial and good, requesting them to open a PR. `mslipper` later opened a PR for this fix, stating it was trivial to implement. ([#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17872))
