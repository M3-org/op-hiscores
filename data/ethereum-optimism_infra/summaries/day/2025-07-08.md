# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Jul 8, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing `proxyd` with new error handling for client-canceled requests and introducing conditional rate limiting for transaction senders, improving robustness and control.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced `proxyd` Error Handling
A new "499" error code has been introduced in `proxyd` to specifically track instances where a client cancels a request, improving metrics and visibility into client-side cancellations ([#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/420)).

### Conditional Rate Limiting for Transaction Senders
`proxyd` now supports conditional rate limiting for transaction senders and interop, alongside a cleanup of transaction parsing logic ([#421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/421)).

### Clarification on Precompile Address Initialization
Discussion continued on the initialization of addresses 0x00-0xff in the op-stack, which are set with 1 wei balance and no contract code. The latest comment clarifies that these are precompile addresses, and the 1 wei balance is a standard practice to prevent them from being considered empty accounts due to obscure rules ([#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16620)).
