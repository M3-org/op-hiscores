## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Fault Proof Creator Contract OPCM Changes
Discussion continues on understanding and supporting OPCM changes for the Fault Proof creator contract. The latest comment outlines a detailed checklist of remaining tasks, including moving WETH and L2ChainId to `implArgs`, fixing `StandardValidator` assertions, removing `anchorStateRegistry` from `StandardValidatorOverrides`, unskipping and updating tests in `DeployOPChain.t.sol`, reviewing comment responses, addressing TODO comments, and rebasing updates from EVM safety refactoring.
- [#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15789)

### RV Audit - `TestCrossSafeUpdate` and Hazard Set Construction
The issue regarding `TestCrossSafeUpdate` testing impossible cases and the lack of a clear `invalid` signal during Hazard Set construction remains active. A new pull request has been made to address this.
- [#16548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16548)

### Abnormal CPU Usage with `op-geth`
The issue concerning abnormal CPU usage with `op-geth` v1.101511.0 is still active. A user reported that the performance issue was due to an index update, which took about 24 hours to complete on their system. A `profile.pb.gz` file was attached for further analysis.
