# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Aug 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on dependency updates within the `op-acceptor` component, alongside significant discussion on an active issue concerning the deprecation of `req-resp` P2P sync in `op-node`. A key specification for `min-base-fee` was also finalized.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Dependency Updates**: A routine maintenance update was performed to bump the `github.com/ulikunitz/xz` dependency from version 0.5.12 to 0.5.14 in the `op-acceptor` component. This ensures the project utilizes the latest stable versions of its libraries. ([#451](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/451))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Min-Base-Fee Specification Finalized**: The specification for `min-base-fee` has been formally written and ratified, with the issue now closed. This marks a significant step in defining this protocol feature. ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/742))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Deprecating `req-resp` P2P Sync in `op-node`**: Discussions continued regarding the removal of `req-resp` P2P sync in `op-node` to address existing sync problems. The latest comments provide additional context and ideas from @emilianobonassi, who has prototyped an alternate unsafe block sync mechanism. This alternative is highlighted for being cheaper, simpler, and faster for scaling out and recovery compared to the current `req-resp` protocol. It addresses issues like UDP networking complexities, lack of domain name support for static IPs, and race conditions that lead to slow and unstable synchronization. The proposed alternative is complementary to P2P and suggests plugging multiple "drivers" for block gossiping, including a centralized one where the sequencer leader publishes the latest unsafe block via Redis, and other nodes subscribe and inject it via `admin_postUnsafePayload`.
