# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Sep 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in infrastructure, with new features for `op-acceptor` to surface effective configurations and `proxyd` gaining support for post-Fusaka blob transactions. Several key issues related to load testing, partner support criteria, and threat modeling were also closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Configuration Visibility for `op-acceptor`
A new feature was added to `op-acceptor` to log and display a summary of its effective configuration on startup and in HTML reports. This also includes outputting the effective configuration as a JSON file, improving transparency and debugging capabilities [#463](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/463).

### `proxyd` Update for Blob Transactions
`proxyd` now supports post-Fusaka blob transactions, including cell proofs. This update involved upgrading Geth and monorepo versions used by `proxyd` and also addressed a bug where `proxyd` would panic on ingesting pre-EIP-155 transactions [#464](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/464).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Testing and Evaluation
Two critical issues related to Flashblocks were closed today. This includes the successful completion of load testing on `eris-0` to ensure its readiness for public service [#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16756) and the evaluation of partner support criteria on `eris-0` using its Flashblocks enablement [#16765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16765).

### Threat Modeling and Failure Analysis
The threat modeling and failure modes analysis for the DA Footprint Limit has been completed and closed [#336](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/336).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Receipt Correction: Failed to decode RLP receipts [#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/679)
The issue regarding Geth crashing with "Receipt Correction: Failed to decode RLP receipts" (v1.101602.0) during full sync on op-mainnet is being actively investigated. A potential fix has been identified and shared for testing, with the reporter confirming the issue is likely resolved with the latest patch.

### Dispute game creator pattern refactor: update specs [#17436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17436)
Discussion is ongoing regarding whether this issue is a duplicate of another related to dispute game contract parameters. The intent is to ensure that changes to dispute game contract parameters are reflected in the specifications, and to double-check for any other related changes.
