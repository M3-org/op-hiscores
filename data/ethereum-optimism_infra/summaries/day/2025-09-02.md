# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Sep 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on significant refactoring within the `op-acceptor` component, enhancing test runner modularity and logging capabilities. Additionally, two key acceptance testing issues related to porting tests to Devstack were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-acceptor` Test Runner Refactoring
The monolithic `op-acceptor` test runner was significantly refactored into five focused components, improving maintainability and separation of concerns. This involved splitting the 1,755-line `runner.go` file into `TestExecutor`, `OutputParser`, and other modules. ([#448](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/448))

### Enhanced `op-acceptor` Logging
Logging within `op-acceptor` was refined by splitting per-test logs into three distinct files: a plaintext `.txt` file, a raw JSON `.json` file, and a test result summary `.log` file. The HTML report was also updated to link to these new log formats. ([#453](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/453))

This includes porting `TestFjord` ([#440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/440)) and `TestSmokeTestFailure` along with `TestInteropSystemNoop` ([#444](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/444)) to the Devstack environment.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kona + Cannon: OPCM Support
Discussion on [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17285) revolves around the necessary changes in OPCM to support Kona + Cannon. The latest comment from ajsutton clarifies that OPCM needs to support deploying the new game type, specifically highlighting a section in `contracts-bedrock` that will require updates. Earlier, pauldowman suggested confirming if any changes are truly needed before closing the issue.

### Kona + Cannon: op-dispute-mon Support
On [#17286](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17286), the focus is on updating `op-dispute-mon` to support `cannon-kona` game types. pauldowman's latest comment clarifies the issue's objective to "Update to support cannon-kona games." Previously, ajsutton emphasized that `dispute-mon` must return an error for unsupported game types and that it will need to be updated to explicitly support `cannon-kana` game types, rather than just looking at specific types.
