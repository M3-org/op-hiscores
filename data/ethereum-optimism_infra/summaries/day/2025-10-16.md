# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Oct 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a critical fix for the `op-conductor-ops` tool, addressing a typo related to voter assignment. Several issues concerning DA footprint limits and sequencer configurations were closed, indicating progress in these areas.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Conductor Operations Tooling Refinement
A typo in the `op-conductor-ops` tool was fixed, specifically addressing an issue where adding a new member was incorrectly assumed to always be a voter. This ensures more accurate configuration of the conductor.
- feat: fix conductor-ops typo, when adding a new member its not always…. BODY: … a voter ([#492](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/492))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Data Availability Footprint Limit Enhancements
Two issues related to the Data Availability (DA) Footprint Limit were closed. These involved writing an acceptance test and adding unit tests to `op-geth` to ensure `gasUsed` changes correctly when the scaled DA footprint exceeds actual gas usage.
- [DA Footprint Limit] Write acceptance test ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17278))
- [DA Footprint Limit] add unit tests ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17395))

### Sepolia Sequencer Configuration Adjustment
An issue concerning the demotion and lightening of `op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1` on Sepolia was closed. While the original intent was to lighten this sequencer, it was ultimately kept in the Sepolia voter set, and `prod-sepolia-op-opn-geth-f-sunnyseq-1` was removed instead.
- demote and lighten op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1 of sepolia ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17683))

## NEW ISSUES

### Sequencer Startup Failure
A new issue was reported regarding `op-conductor` failing to start a sequencer with the error "no unsafe head" after linking the conductor.
- op-conductor :Failed to start sequencer, err="no unsafe head" ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17899))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Jovian Operator Fee Saturating Math Review
Discussion continues on the `jovian/operator-fee/GPO` issue regarding revisiting saturating math in the `operatorFee` getter. The latest comment suggests that a recent analysis might imply no need for any saturating math in this context.
