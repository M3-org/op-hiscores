# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Oct 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a critical fix for the `op-conductor-ops` tool, addressing a typo related to voter assignment. Several issues concerning DA footprint limits and sequencer configurations were closed, indicating progress in these areas.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Conductor Operations Improvement
A fix was implemented in the `op-conductor-ops` tool to correct a typo, specifically clarifying that adding a new member does not always imply they are a voter. This enhancement improves the accuracy and reliability of conductor operations. ([#492](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/492))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Data Availability Footprint Limit Resolution
Two issues related to the Data Availability (DA) Footprint Limit were closed today. This includes writing an acceptance test for the DA Footprint Limit ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17278)) and adding unit tests for the same in `op-geth` ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17395)). These closures indicate progress in validating and testing the DA footprint functionality.

### Sepolia Sequencer Configuration Update
An issue concerning the demotion and lightening of `op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1` on Sepolia was closed ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17683)). The resolution involved keeping `op-opn-geth-a-sequencer-1` in the Sepolia voter set and instead removing `prod-sepolia-op-opn-geth-f-sunnyseq-1`.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-conductor: Sequencer Startup Failure
Issue [#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17899), "op-conductor :Failed to start sequencer, err="no unsafe head"", describes a problem where a sequencer fails to start after being linked to the conductor. The issue was opened today, and a request for assistance was made by @wluisw to @zhwrd.

### Jovian/Operator-Fee/GPO: Revisit Saturating Math
Issue [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17888) discusses revisiting a potential saturating math issue in the `operatorFee` getter. The latest comment from @geoknee suggests that a recent analysis might imply no need for any saturating math in this context.
