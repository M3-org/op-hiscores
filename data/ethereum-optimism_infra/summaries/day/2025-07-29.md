### Congestion-based Builder Transaction Reordering
Discussion continued on [#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/306), which proposes designing a system for congestion-based builder transaction reordering. The latest comment from moonfury-ops at 20:33:56Z expressed interest in collaborating on the issue with @sebastianst. The issue aims to track data availability usage excess over time and apply an exponential cost/score penalty, potentially as an external implementation to test the idea for an L1 congestion cost component.
