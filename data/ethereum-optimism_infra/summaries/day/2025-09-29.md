# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Sep 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing logging capabilities within `op-acceptor` and resolving several key issues related to flashblocks deployment and load testing, as well as clarifying L2CL and L2EL synchronization conditions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Logging and ANSI Stripping in `op-acceptor`
A new feature was added to `op-acceptor` to improve logging by replacing the custom ANSI stripper with a more robust solution, ensuring cleaner log outputs. ([#478](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/478))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#480](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/480) Jelias2/proxyd mise build fix, was opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Load Testing
The issue of deploying a flashblocks-rpc node was closed, with confirmation of a successful spin-up. Additionally, load tests for the rollup-boost flashblocks forwarder were completed and documented. ([#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16764), [#17462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17462))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### L2CL and L2EL Synchronization Conditions
Discussions continued on [#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17628) regarding the conditions for L2EL to start syncing. The latest comments from @pcw109550, @sebastianst, and @ajsutton clarified that the EL client should simply sync, regardless of the specific mechanism (e.g., snap-sync), as long as it has p2p connections and receives a FCU call. The ticket may be closed soon as the focus shifts to handling EL Syncs after the initial run.
