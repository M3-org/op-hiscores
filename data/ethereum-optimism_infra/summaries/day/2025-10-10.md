### Addressing `op-dispute-mon` Out-of-Sync Node Handling
Discussion on [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17814) centers on the `op-dispute-mon` incorrectly identifying disagreements when one of the configured rollup RPCs is out of sync. The latest comments suggest that while a related PR ([#17819](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17819)) might mitigate some instances, a more general solution is needed. This solution could involve using `syncStatus` to determine the true L2 head across all nodes and ignoring results from nodes that are significantly behind, rather than treating their differing outputs as a disagreement. There's also a consideration that simply trusting the highest L2 block might be problematic if it's from an incorrect fork, suggesting a need to verify if the node has processed the relevant L1 block.
