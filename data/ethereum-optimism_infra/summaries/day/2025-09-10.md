# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Sep 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a new feature added to `op-acceptor` for improved progress indication. Several Kurtosis-related issues were closed, indicating a shift in focus, and a new issue was opened for `op-program` to enhance block header lookups.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-acceptor` Progress Indicator Refinement
A new feature was introduced to refactor the progress indicator in `op-acceptor`, removing a redundant UI parameter from `NewParallelExecutor` for cleaner code and potentially improved efficiency ([#458](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/458)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kurtosis Devnet Prioritization Shift
Several issues related to the Kurtosis devnet were closed, with comments indicating that Kurtosis is not currently a priority for implementation. These include adding genesis checks to `optimism-package` ([#15753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15753)), improving Kurtosis idempotency and performance ([#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/14390)), extracting/mapping L1 chain config ([#15050](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15050)), creating tests for `proxyd` ([#15558](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15558)), adding a rotatory welcome message ([#15511](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15511)), investigating selective service selection ([#15537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15537)), and adding Kurtosis support to `op-validator` ([#16712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16712)).

### Flashblocks Delivery Threat Modeling Concluded
An issue concerning threat modeling related to flashblocks delivery was closed, with a detailed comment outlining that while improvements are needed for reliability and security, no novel risks were identified beyond existing container image practices. The long-term solution involves provenance-based admission control ([#17144](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17144)).

### Dispute Game Implementation Update
An issue to use v2 dispute game implementations in `OCPM.addGameType` was closed as a duplicate of another issue ([#17259](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17259)).

## NEW ISSUES

### `op-program` Block Header Oracle Enhancement
A new issue was opened to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookups in `op-program` and its specifications, aiming to provide key information before looking up a block hash by number ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17416)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Kurtosis Reverse Proxy Websockets Support
Discussion on implementing Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy ([#17194](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17194)) indicates that this feature will not be implemented. A comment from @alfonso-op on September 10, 2025, stated "Won't implement, closing." However, @ajsutton reopened the issue on the same day, noting a "TODO" in the code that references this issue and suggesting it needs to be removed if the feature is truly abandoned. @alfonso-op followed up on September 11, 2025, requesting the removal of the TODO before final closure.
