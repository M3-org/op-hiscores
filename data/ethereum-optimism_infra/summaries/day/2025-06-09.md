# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Jun 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw progress in addressing documentation issues, particularly concerning deprecated components and testnet setup. Discussions continued on improving CI stability and supervisor L1 origin handling, with a focus on refining reset logic and addressing test flakiness.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Test Automation and Deprecated Documentation
Two issues were closed today. One involved the acceptance test for Conductor leadership transfer, which was successfully implemented and closed [#351](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/351). The other addressed documentation regarding the L2OutputOracleProxy, which is deprecated, leading to the closure of [#1614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1614) as the testnet tutorial is outdated.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### CI Flakiness Investigation
Discussions on [#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16271) continued with scharissis providing a detailed breakdown of the top 10 flakiest acceptance tests, noting that most flakiness stems from infrastructure issues rather than acceptance testing itself. Related issues and PRs were also linked for further context.

### Supervisor L1 Origin Handling
On [#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16315), sebastianst emphasized that all targets provided by the supervisor should be valid, suggesting that the supervisor should handle validity checks and re-requests for resets if targets are invalid, rather than duplicating checks on the op-node. This aims to reduce complexity in the reset logic.

### Incorrect Nonce Return
Issue [#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/623) regarding `eth_getTransactionCount` returning an incorrect nonce for pending transactions remains active, with ntrzr requesting an update on the investigation.

### Superchain Interop Quickstart Guide
Discussions on [#1644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1644) indicate that the proposed quickstart guide for Superchain Interop environments is being considered for broader content on a homepage, with sbvegan, @bradleycamacho, and @krofax exploring a wider lens for this content. @krofax committed to drafting content by tomorrow.

### Complete Withdrawal Flow Test
On [#327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/327), serpixel confirmed the implementation of the complete withdrawal flow test (sysgo) in [#16333](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16333). Two follow-up tickets are planned: adding support for kt (sysext) and executing only a withdrawal without proving it (devnet).
