# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Nov 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the infrastructure's CI/CD pipeline by adding comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for Docker image building and attestation across various components. A minor chore update was also released for `op-acceptor`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced CI/CD for Docker Images
New GitHub Actions workflows have been introduced to automate the building, attestation, and signing of Docker images for all infrastructure components. This significantly improves the security and reliability of our deployment process. ([#510](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/510))

### `op-acceptor` Version Update
A new version, v3.6.6, of `op-acceptor` was released. This was a minor update to facilitate a fresh commit for tagging a new release. ([#509](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/509))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#511](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/511) chore(deps): bump github.com/consensys/gnark-crypto from 0.12.1 to 0.18.1 in /op-txproxy: This PR proposes an update to a dependency in the `op-txproxy` component.

## CLOSED ISSUES
- **Deprecation of Kurtosis Support**
  The issue regarding supporting `sysext` in `op-sync-tester` and `op-devstack` was closed due to the deprecation of Kurtosis. ([#16704](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16704))

## NEW ISSUES
- **Kona Prestate Support Tracking**
  A new tracking issue has been opened to add support for embedded custom prestates to Kona. ([#18271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18271))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Dispute Game v2 Compatibility for Staging Report Script**
  Discussions continue on updating the `print_staging_report` script to be compatible with dispute-game v2. The latest comments clarify that the script primarily reads from the permissioned game, suggesting that changes to the output format might not be as disruptive as initially thought. However, concerns remain about the script's assumption of only two games (permissioned and permissionless) when there will eventually be two permissionless games.
