# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Sep 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `op-acceptor` tool with a new console progress indicator and fixing a Go releaser issue. Several flashblocks-related issues were closed, indicating progress in mainnet deployment and monitoring.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-acceptor` Tooling Improvements
The `op-acceptor` tool received a significant update with the addition of a console progress indicator, providing users with better feedback during test execution [#457](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/457). A bug related to the Go releaser when `mise` is activated was also fixed, ensuring smoother operation for `op-acceptor` [#459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/459).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks Deployment and Monitoring
Multiple issues related to the deployment and monitoring of flashblocks on mainnet were closed. This includes enabling flashblocks on specific sequencers [#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16759), [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17317), and the remaining sequencers on OP Labs infra [#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16760). Alerts for low peer count health of flashblocks-enabled sequencers were also addressed [#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16868).

### `op-acceptor` Progress Indicator Implementation
The issue tracking the improvement of the `op-acceptor` progress indicator was closed, following the implementation of a more informative console output [#456](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/456).

### Obsolete NAT Smoke Tests
Several Network Acceptance Testing (NAT) smoke test issues for `op-challenger` [#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/141), general proofs [#140](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/140), `op-dispute-mon` [#142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/142), and `op-proposer` [#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/143) were closed as they are no longer required.

### Documentation Update
A documentation suggestion to add an example for custom chains in the bridging ETH tutorial was closed after the tutorial was updated [#1473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1473).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblocks and Sequencer Health
Discussions around flashblocks continue, with updates on enabling flashblocks on remaining sequencers and confirming stability. The issue regarding alerting on low peer count for flashblocks-enabled sequencers was solved with a new PR. The issue concerning alerts for unhealthy non-flashblocks enabled sequencers was closed, as existing alerts already cover this. The upgrade of `rbuilder` and `node-reth` for a chain stall fix was closed as it was deemed a non-blocker for L2.

### `op-conductor` EL P2P Healthchecks
The issue to release and deploy `op-conductor` with EL P2P healthchecks was closed, with confirmation that it is done and working healthily.

### Kurtosis Reverse Proxy Websockets Support
The issue for implementing Websockets support in the Kurtosis Reverse Proxy is still active, with a recent comment indicating that the feature will not be implemented and a TODO in the code needs to be removed.

### `op-program` Fast Block Header Oracle Lookup
A new issue was opened to add a hint for fast block header oracle lookup in `op-program`, with a draft PR already available for validation.

### Contract Upgrade Tests
An issue to add "soneium" to contract upgrade tests is active, with a PR opened to address it.
