# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Oct 31, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing `op-acceptor` metrics and significant progress in closing out several long-standing issues related to Superchain Registry improvements, test suite enhancements, and flashblocks tuning.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Metrics Improvements
- Enhanced `op-acceptor` with new metrics to improve monitoring and observability ([#503](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/503)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Registry Enhancements
- Addressed the need to include chain names in `addresses.json` after TOML file removal, closing the issue as breaking changes were not pursued ([#999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/999)).
- Completed the update to the `add-chain` script to handle input variations in `genesis.json` and `rollup.json` ([#220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/220)).
- Implemented checks for config parameters for each chain within the Superchain Registry ([#294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/294)).
- Resolved the issue of adding `L2ProxyAdminOwner` to TOML files ([#470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/470)).
- Added support for Holesky testnets ([#518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/518)).
- Addressed the inclusion of contract implementation addresses in the Superchain config ([#520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/520)).
- Overhauled the storage and discovery of fault proof contract addresses in chain configs and validation packages ([#604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/604)).
- Moved L1 RPC URL handling from Superchain initialization to validation ([#609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/609)).

### Test Suite and CI Improvements
- Made the `op-acceptance-tests` workflow blocking to prevent merges with failing tests ([#16270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16270)).
- Resolved a flakey nil pointer dereference during `add-chain` tests ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/635)).
- Closed the CI flake issue related to the `add-chain` help flag being redefined, as the workflow is no longer active ([#477](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/477)).

### Flashblocks and Deployment Tooling
- Tuned the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy-upstream-messages-low` alert for Sepolia ([#17716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17716)).
- Closed the `op-deployer` issue regarding adding verification guides to OP docs, as it is no longer a priority ([#17145](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17145)).
- Closed the `op-deployer` issue concerning logs and Etherscan verification on Sepolia, in favor of another issue ([#18089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18089)).

## NEW ISSUES
- No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Flashblocks Monitoring
- **alert when non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off** ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16867)): The latest comment from zhwrd questions the current relevance of the ticket and whether a detection mechanism for disabled flashblocks already exists. This follows an earlier comment from jelias2 indicating that an alert would be created once a specific PR lands.

### Acceptance Test Suite Refinement
- **[op-acceptance-tests] Report unused tests** ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16273)): janjakubnanista inquired if this feature is still desired, following an earlier discussion by alfonso-op about a "staging" gate for tests.
- **[op-acceptance-tests] Parallelise "memory-all" job** ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17525)): janjakubnanista asked if this is still a priority, noting that the PR addressing it was auto-closed.

### Superchain Registry Refactor and Validation
- **SuperchainRegistry: improve the diff tools** ([#284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/284)): janjakubnanista questioned if the diff tools have been revamped with the recent refactor, indicating potential completion or significant changes.
- **investigate L2 key handover test** ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/643)): janjakubnanista asked if this issue remains relevant after the refactor, suggesting it might be resolved or superseded.
- **ci: update `golang-validate-all` job to give summary of passes/failures** ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/644)): janjakubnanista inquired if this has been addressed by SCR 2.0, following a previous comment by jmcoplabs about a refactor to decouple the golang test framework.
- **encode ProxyAdminOwner exceptions for Base and Unichain** ([#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/675)): janjakubnanista believes this has been addressed by SCR 2.0, seeking confirmation from bitwiseguy. This follows earlier discussions about the specifics of the 3/3 multisig for Base and Unichain.

### Proxyd Behavior
- **proxyd: backwards time travel is possible when backends are not in sync** ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/501)): alfonso-op linked this issue to a related one with more details, highlighting a potential problem with `proxyd` returning older blocks if backends are out of sync.
