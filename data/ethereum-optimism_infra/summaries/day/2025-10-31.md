# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Oct 31, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing `op-acceptor` metrics and significant progress in closing out several long-standing issues related to Superchain Registry improvements, test suite blocking, and flashblocks tuning.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Metrics Improvements
- Enhanced `op-acceptor` with new metrics to improve monitoring and operational visibility ([#503](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/503)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Superchain Registry Enhancements
- Addressed the need to include chain names in `addresses.json` after TOML file removal, closing the issue as breaking changes were not pursued ([#999](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/999)).
- Completed updates to the `add-chain` script to handle variations in `genesis.json` and `rollup.json` inputs ([#220](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/220)).
- Improved Superchain Registry diff tools, with the issue closed as the tools were revamped during a refactor ([#284](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/284)).
- Implemented checks for config parameters for each chain within the Superchain Registry ([#294](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/294)).
- Resolved the issue of adding `L2ProxyAdminOwner` to TOML files ([#470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/470)).
- Added support for Holesky testnets ([#518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/518)).
- Incorporated contract implementation addresses into the Superchain config ([#520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/520)).
- Overhauled the storage and discovery of fault proof contract addresses in chain configs and validation packages ([#604](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/604)).
- Moved L1 RPC URL handling from Superchain initialization to validation, addressing the issue through refactoring ([#609](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/609)).
- Closed the issue regarding encoding `ProxyAdminOwner` exceptions for Base and Unichain, noting it was addressed with SCR 2.0 ([#675](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/675)).

### CI/CD and Testing Improvements
- Made the `op-acceptance-tests` workflow blocking to prevent merges with failing tests ([#16270](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16270)).
- Addressed a CI flake related to the `add-chain` help flag being redefined, closing it as the workflow is no longer active and codegen is stable ([#477](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/477)).
- Resolved a flakey nil pointer dereference during `add-chain` tests ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/635)).
- Closed the issue for `golang-validate-all` job summary improvements, as it was addressed by SCR 2.0 ([#644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/644)).

### Flashblocks and Deployment Updates
- Tuned the `flashblocks-websocket-proxy-upstream-messages-low` alert for Sepolia, confirming completion and ongoing work on Flashblocks allocation ([#17716](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17716)).
- Closed the `op-deployer` issue regarding adding verification guides to OP docs, as it is no longer a priority ([#17145](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17145)).
- Closed the `op-deployer` issue for logs and Etherscan verification on Sepolia, in favor of another issue ([#18089](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18089)).

## NEW ISSUES
- No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Acceptance Test Reporting and Parallelization
- **[op-acceptance-tests] Report unused tests** ([#16273](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16273)): The latest comment from janjakubnanista questions the continued relevance of this issue, asking if reporting unused tests is still desired. Previously, alfonso-op suggested a "staging" gate for tests that run but don't block merges, to ensure all tests are within a gate while allowing for promotion to blocking checks.
- **[op-acceptance-tests] Parallelise "memory-all" job** ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17525)): janjakubnanista inquired if this issue is still relevant, given that the PR intended to fix it was auto-closed. The original goal was to parallelize the "memory-all" job to avoid increasing CI duration, especially as the workflow is intended to be blocking.

### Flashblocks Monitoring and Alerts
- **alert when non-flashblocks-enabled sequencer is active or flashblocks are turned off** ([#16867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16867)): zhwrd's latest comment asks if this ticket is still relevant or if a detection method for disabled flashblocks already exists. The issue aims to create an alert for scenarios where a backup sequencer without flashblocks components becomes active, indicating a potential issue with flashblocks. jelias2 previously noted that an alert would be created once a specific pull request lands.

### Proxyd Time Travel Issue
- **proxyd: backwards time travel is possible when backends are not in sync** ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/501)): alfonso-op linked this issue to a related one with more details. The core problem is that Proxyd can return older blocks as the `unsafe` block if its backends are out of sync, potentially leading to "time travel" behavior.

### L2 Key Handover Test Investigation
- **investigate L2 key handover test** ([#643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/643)): janjakubnanista asked @bitwiseguy if this issue remains relevant after a recent refactor. The issue was opened to investigate a specific L2 key handover test during `op-deployer` review.
