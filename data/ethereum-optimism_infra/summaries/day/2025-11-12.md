# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Nov 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, including security enhancements for `proxyd` and resolving `mise` installation errors. Discussions continued on optimizing `op-node`'s safe-head advancement and documenting `cannonKonaPrestate` requirements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Security and Stability Improvements
Significant bug fixes were implemented to enhance the security of `proxyd` and address installation issues with `mise`. These changes contribute to a more robust and reliable infrastructure.
- `proxyd`: Security-oriented fixes were applied to `proxyd`, impacting `backend.go`, `backend_test.go`, `config.go`, `proxyd.go`, and `server.go` ([#493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/493)).
- `mise`: An error preventing `mise` installation was resolved, specifically addressing issues similar to those previously fixed for 'asterisc' ([#508](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/508)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Kona Action Test Completion
The issue tracking the implementation of passing action tests for Kona for Jovian was closed, indicating successful integration and testing.
- Jovian action tests were added in `op-e2e/actions/proofs` and are now run by Kona's CI, confirming the completion of this task ([#17303](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17303)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Optimizing `op-node` Safe-Head Advancement
Discussions continued regarding the `op-node`'s single aggregate safe-head advancement FCU message per channel ([#15393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15393)). A recent merge in the `optimism` repository was noted as potentially helpful. The `kona-node` implementation of sending only one FCU per span batch in the happy-path was highlighted as a potential solution. Earlier comments detailed the problem of FCU spam due to every pending safe update event triggering an FCU, and suggestions were made to modify the `Concluding` flag logic. The impact of round-trip time on FCU processing was also discussed, with a suggestion to add a debounce to the engine-controller FCU code.

### Documenting `cannonKonaPrestate` for Upgrades
The need to document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for upgrades was discussed ([#18095](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18095)). The latest update indicates that the devrel team agrees on highlighting this requirement in the Optimism documentation, especially in light of the U18 upgrade.

### Improving Batcher Safeguards on SystemConfig
A new discussion emerged concerning improving safeguards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig ([#18246](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18246)). This issue is considered somewhat related to a similar discussion in the `optimism` repository regarding `optimism/issues/17490`.
