# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Dec 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining CI workflows, including a critical fix for the tags workflow to ensure Docker builds succeed and a significant refactoring to split CI runs between protected and unprotected branches. A new pull request was opened to verify the fork PR workflow.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI Workflow Enhancements and Fixes
A critical bug in the tags workflow was fixed, addressing 'not found' errors during Docker builds by correctly setting the repository root context ([#522](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/522)). Additionally, the CI workflow configuration was refactored to split runs between protected and unprotected branches/tags, consolidating multiple service-specific workflow files ([#519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/519)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#523](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/523), was opened to test and verify the fork PR workflow.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-node Stuck in EL Sync Mode
Discussion continued on [#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18468), where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart when Reth has already synced data. The latest comment suggests a temporary fix: changing the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restarting the `op-node`. This issue is blocking a Base Mainnet node.
