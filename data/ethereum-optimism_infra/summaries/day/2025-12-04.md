# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Dec 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining CI workflows, including a critical fix for the tags workflow to ensure Docker image builds succeed. Additionally, CI configurations were refactored to separate protected and unprotected branch/tag workflows, streamlining the build process.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI Workflow Enhancements and Fixes
A critical bug in the tags workflow was fixed, addressing 'not found' errors during Docker image builds by correctly setting the repository root context ([#522](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/522)). This ensures that Dockerfiles can correctly reference paths.

### CI Workflow Refactoring
The CI workflow configuration for Docker image builds was refactored, consolidating multiple service-specific workflow files into two new workflows: one for protected branches/tags and another for unprotected ones ([#519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/519)). This change streamlines the CI process and improves maintainability.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#523](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/523), was opened to add a test for verifying the fork PR workflow.

## CLOSED ISSUES
- An issue regarding documentation for `/node-operators/reference/consensus-layer-sync` was closed today ([#1895](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1895)). The issue can be reopened if more context is provided.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-node stuck in EL sync mode after restart ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18468))
The discussion on this issue highlights that `op-node` gets stuck in an initialization loop, continuously reporting `el_syncing=true` when configured with `--syncmode=execution-layer` and restarted after syncing with reth. This is blocking Base Mainnet nodes. A temporary fix suggested is to change the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restart the `op-node`.
