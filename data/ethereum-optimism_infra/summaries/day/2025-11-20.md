# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on dependency updates across various services, specifically bumping the `golang.org/x/crypto` version. A significant issue regarding low batcher throughput was closed with a new runbook, and a new issue was opened concerning the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency in `AnchorStateRegistry`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Batcher Throughput Runbook
The issue concerning a runbook for low batcher throughput was closed, with a new runbook created to address potential issues where `MinBaseFee` is set too high, leading to transaction inclusion problems. [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16959)

## NEW ISSUES

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency
A new issue was opened regarding the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency in `AnchorStateRegistry`, highlighting a potential incompatibility with dispute game types that do not have an `anchorStateRegistry()` method. [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18347)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### AnchorStateRegistry Dependency Refinement [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18347)
Discussion revolves around the necessity and implementation of the `IFaultDisputeGame` dependency in `AnchorStateRegistry`. Inphi suggested expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface to require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method to maintain the sanity check. ajsutton questioned the necessity of the sanity check, noting that deployment-time checks via `OPStandardValidator` already ensure the correct `ASR` is used. However, ajsutton also acknowledged that the recent addition of `wasRespectedAtGameCreation` might make requiring the method less problematic.
