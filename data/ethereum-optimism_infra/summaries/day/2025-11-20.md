# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on dependency updates across various services, specifically bumping the `golang.org/x/crypto` version. A critical issue regarding low batcher throughput was resolved with a new runbook, and a new architectural issue concerning the `AnchorStateRegistry` in dispute games was opened for discussion.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Runbook for Low Batcher Throughput
The issue concerning a runbook for low batcher throughput was closed today. A runbook has been created to address scenarios where the `MinBaseFee` might be set too high, leading to a drop in batcher throughput.
- min-base-fee: runbook for low batcher throughput [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16959)

## NEW ISSUES

### Dispute Game Interface Dependency
A new issue was opened to discuss the dependency of `IFaultDisputeGame` on `AnchorStateRegistry`. The current implementation checks for a matching `anchorStateRegistry()` via a cast, which may not be compatible with all game types.
- Remove IFaultDisputeGame dependency from AnchorStateRegistry [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18347)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Remove IFaultDisputeGame dependency from AnchorStateRegistry [#18347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18347)
Discussion revolves around the necessity and implications of the `IFaultDisputeGame`'s dependency on `AnchorStateRegistry`. Inphi suggested expanding the `IDisputeGame` interface to require an `AnchorStateRegistry` method to maintain the sanity check. Ajsutton questioned the necessity of the sanity check, noting that deployment-time checks via `OPStandardValidator` already ensure the correct `ASR` is used. However, ajsutton also acknowledged that the `wasRespectedAtGameCreation` feature might tie dispute game implementations more closely to the `AnchorStateRegistry`, potentially making the current requirement less problematic.
