# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Dec 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the `replica-healthcheck` Docker build process for consistency and addressing several ZK-related issues, with multiple issues being closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
### Build Process Alignment
The `replica-healthcheck` Docker image build process was updated to use the repository root as the build context, aligning it with other images and ensuring consistent build configurations across the project. This change impacts the Dockerfile and CircleCI configuration. ([#521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/521))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### ZK Proof Generation Strategy Finalized
The investigation into which service should generate ZK proofs concluded, with the decision to use the succinct proposer. ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18319))

### ZK Game Challenger Support
Support for challenging ZK game types in `op-challenger` has been implemented and the corresponding issue closed, with further acceptance tests to be tracked separately. ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18321))

### Challenger Configuration Refinements
Several issues related to the `challenger` service's configuration, including test coverage, reading from the DGF registry, fetching challenger bonds, reloading bond values, and supporting challenger address changes, were closed as `op-challenger` is now capable of handling these aspects for ZK games. ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18427), [#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18412), [#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18413), [#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18414), [#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18415))

## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### op-node EL Sync Mode Issue
A user reported experiencing the same issue where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart, even when Reth has already synced data, impacting their Base Mainnet node. ([#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18468))

### Unused OP Constants
A discussion is ongoing regarding the usage of OP constants, with a suggestion to close the issue if the problem has been addressed. ([#13440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/13440))

### Fusaka-on-L2 Acceptance Tests
A comment was added suggesting the inclusion of acceptance tests to verify that features not included in `fusaka-on-l2` are properly disabled on OP chains. ([#18221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18221))
