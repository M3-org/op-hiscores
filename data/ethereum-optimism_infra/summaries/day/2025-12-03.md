# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Dec 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a critical bug fix for the `replica-healthcheck` Docker build context, ensuring consistency across images. Several issues related to ZK proof generation and challenger support were closed, indicating progress in these areas.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Build Process Improvements
A bug fix was implemented to align the `replica-healthcheck` Docker image build process with other images by using the repository root as the build context. This ensures consistent Dockerfile `COPY` paths and CircleCI configurations across all images ([#521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/521)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### ZK Proof Generation and Challenger Support
Several issues related to the generation of ZK proofs and the `op-challenger`'s support for ZK game types were closed. This includes a spike investigation concluding that the succinct proposer will generate ZK proofs ([#18319](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18319)) and the completion of `op-challenger` support for ZK game types ([#18321](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18321)).

### Challenger Configuration and Bond Handling
Multiple issues concerning the `challenger`'s configuration and bond handling were closed. These include improvements to test coverage ([#18427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18427)), reading from the DGF registry ([#18412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18412)), fetching challenger bonds from game arguments ([#18413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18413)), reloading bond values ([#18414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18414)), and supporting challenger address changes ([#18415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18415)). These issues were closed as the `op-challenger` is now capable of handling these aspects for ZK games.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node` EL Sync Mode Issue
Issue [#18468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18468) describes a problem where `op-node` gets stuck in EL sync mode after a restart, even when Reth has already synced data. The latest comment suggests a temporary workaround: changing the sync mode from EL sync to CL sync and restarting the `op-node`. This issue is impacting a Base Mainnet node.

### Unused OP Constants
Issue [#13440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/13440) highlights that many OP constants are defined but not consistently used, with direct values often being used instead. A recent comment suggests that this issue might already be resolved and asks for its closure.

### Fusaka-on-L2 Acceptance Tests
Issue [#18221](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18221) outlines the plan to write acceptance tests for new EIPs in `fusaka-on-l2`. The latest comment suggests that acceptance tests may also be added to assert that features not included in `fusaka-on-l2` are properly disabled on OP chains.
