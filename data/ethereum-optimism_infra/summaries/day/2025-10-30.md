# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Oct 30, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining `op-acceptor`'s subtest timeout handling and addressing a critical `proxyd` issue regarding backward time travel. Discussions also continued on L3 L1 chain config skipping and acceptance test improvements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-acceptor` Timeout Handling Refinement
- Refactored `op-acceptor`'s subtest timeout handling to ensure completed subtests retain their real status, marking only unfinished subtests as timed out, improving accuracy in test results ([#500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/500)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A dependency bump for `github.com/consensys/gnark-crypto` from 0.12.1 to 0.18.1 in `/op-conductor-mon` was opened ([#502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/502)).

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### `proxyd` Time Travel Vulnerability
- A new issue was reported where `proxyd` can "travel back in time" by returning previous blocks as the `unsafe` block if its backends are not in sync, potentially leading to incorrect data ([#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/501)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `op-deployer` Transaction Gas Limit Issues
- Discussion continued on the `op-deployer:v0.2.6` failure to deploy contracts due to "transaction gas limit too high" ([#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17912)). A comment confirmed that the Fusaka hardfork enforces a transaction gas limit cap of 16,777,216, and suggested using `v0.5.0*` of `op-deployer` (a release candidate) as a potential solution, though it hasn't been tested post-Fusaka.

### `op-node`, `op-program`: L1 Chain Config for L3s
- The discussion around the ability to skip L1 chain config for L3s in `op-node` and `op-program` saw further input ([#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18070)). A key suggestion was to automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID and apply L3 behavior, similar to how L1 mainnet and Sepolia are recognized.

### Acceptance Test Improvements
- The issue regarding making it easier to run acceptance tests without the monorepo received an additional comment, highlighting that modifying devnets with options often does not work due to private orchestrator fields ([#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/469)).
