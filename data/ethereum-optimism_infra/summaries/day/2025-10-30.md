# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Oct 30, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining `op-acceptor`'s subtest timeout handling, ensuring more accurate status reporting. A new issue was opened regarding `proxyd`'s potential for "time travel" with unsynced backends, and discussions continued on L1 chain config for L3s and acceptance test improvements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-acceptor` Subtest Timeout Refactoring
The `op-acceptor` component saw a significant refactoring of its subtest timeout handling. This change ensures that completed subtests retain their real status, and only subtests that started but did not finish are marked as timed out, leading to more accurate test reporting ([#500](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/500)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#502](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/502), was opened to update the `github.com/consensys/gnark-crypto` dependency from version 0.12.1 to 0.18.1 within the `/op-conductor-mon` module.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES

### `proxyd` Time Travel Vulnerability
A new issue, [#501](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/501), was reported concerning `proxyd`. It describes a scenario where `proxyd` can return older blocks as the `unsafe` block if its backends are not synchronized, effectively allowing "backwards time travel."

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node`, `op-program`: L1 Chain Config for L3s
Discussion continued on [#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18070) regarding the ability for `op-node` and `op-program` to skip L1 chain configuration for L3s. The latest comments suggest that the system should automatically detect if the "L1" chain ID is a known L2 chain ID and apply L3 behavior, similar to how L1 mainnet and Sepolia are recognized, to simplify the process for most L3s.

### `op-deployer`: Transaction Gas Limit Too High
On [#17912](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17912), a user reported an error "transaction gas limit too high" when deploying contracts with `op-deployer:v0.2.6`. The latest comment confirms that the Fusaka hardfork on Sepolia enforces a transaction gas limit cap of 16,777,216 (EIP-7825), which is causing the issue. The suggestion is to break down large transactions or optimize them to stay within the limit. It was also noted that `v0.5.0` (a release candidate) should be used for the latest contract release, though it might still encounter the same problem post-Fusaka.

### Acceptance Test Improvements
Issue [#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/469), which aims to make it easier to run acceptance tests without the monorepo, received a new comment. The comment highlights an additional challenge: modifying devnets with options often doesn't work because orchestrator fields are private.
