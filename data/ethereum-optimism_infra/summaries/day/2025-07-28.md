# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Jul 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant enhancements to the `op-acceptor` tool, primarily focusing on improving test execution flexibility and performance. Key updates include the ability to allow test skips and the introduction of parallel testing capabilities, leading to the closure of two related issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Test Execution Flexibility
The `op-acceptor` tool now offers greater flexibility in handling test skips. A new flag allows users to optionally disable the conversion of test skips into failures, addressing a previously identified need for configurable skip behavior. ([#435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/435))

### Improved Test Performance with Parallel Execution
A major feature addition to `op-acceptor` is the ability to run multiple test packages concurrently. This new default behavior automatically determines the concurrency factor based on system cores, significantly improving testing efficiency. ([#438](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/438))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### `op-acceptor` Test Behavior Configuration
Two issues related to `op-acceptor`'s test behavior have been closed. This includes the implementation of a feature to allow test skips to be treated as skips rather than failures ([#434](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/434)) and the introduction of parallel test execution for improved performance ([#184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/184)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Tracking Min Base Fee
Discussions continue on the `[Tracking] Min Base Fee` issue ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16807)). The latest comments highlight ongoing related work, including a reth draft for early review and other in-flight pull requests in `op-alloy` and `optimism` that are relevant to the minimum base fee implementation.
