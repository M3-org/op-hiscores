# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Jun 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on enhancing observability for the `op-batcher`'s memory consumption, improving Superchain tooling, and closing out several long-standing issues related to flashblocks and CI/CD.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

No completed work was reported for this period.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#417](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/417), was opened to add a metric for monitoring fallback candidate health.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Flashblocks and Devnet Enhancements
Several issues related to flashblocks and devnet configurations were closed. This includes the completion of acceptance tests for flashblocks transactions ([#354](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/354)) and the successful enablement of flashblocks on the eris-0 devnet ([#16468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16468)).

### CI/CD and Developer Tooling Improvements
Discussions around CI SLAs were concluded with the decision not to implement them for now ([#16437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16437)). Additionally, an issue concerning the modification of predeploys for testing was closed as Supersim now supports this functionality ([#393](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/393)). A broken link in the documentation for `L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol` was also resolved ([#283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/283)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Batcher Memory Optimization and Observability
A new spike was initiated to optimize the `op-batcher`'s memory consumption, particularly during L1 congestion ([#16537](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16537)). Complementing this, an issue was opened to increase the observability of the `op-batcher`'s memory usage, including integrating `pprof` into Kurtosis devnet and adding CI tests for memory consumption ([#16572](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16572)).

### Superchain and Local Development Tooling
A feature request was made to enable logging of user-specified contracts within Supersim, which would be beneficial for debugging and development ([#411](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/411)). A clarification issue was also opened to differentiate between Supersim and the interop Kurtosis devnet, highlighting their respective use cases ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/399)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Netchef and Flashblocks Configuration ([#15940](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15940))
The issue is tracking improvements to Netchef to automatically configure the flashblocks-websocket-proxy for HA conductor setups. Recent comments indicate associated PRs have been created in the `infrastructure-services` repository, suggesting active progress on this front.

### OPCM Migrate Script Improvements ([#16326](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16326))
Discussions revolve around improving the `migrate-alphanet.sh` script used for the rehearsal-net-0. The latest comment confirms that the runbook has been updated to include sanity checks for script inputs, indicating that the issue is nearing resolution.

### Withdrawal Pathways for Superchain Output Roots ([#821](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/821))
The discussion focuses on updating the `viem` withdrawal code to support the new output roots structure after the interop hard fork. The latest comment inquires about which upcoming devnet can be used for testing and if an endpoint is already available, highlighting the need for a testing environment.
