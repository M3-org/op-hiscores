# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Sep 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on refining existing infrastructure, with significant discussions around improving CI/CD processes, addressing P2P gossip configuration, and preparing for future protocol upgrades. A key achievement was the closure of an issue related to persistent devnet testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Devnet Testing and Setup Refinement
The issue concerning getting all tests running and passing in persistent devnets has been closed, indicating significant progress in this area [#398](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/398). Additionally, the issue related to scripting permissionless devnet spinup is being considered for closure, suggesting improvements in devnet setup automation [#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/346).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### CI/CD and Developer Experience Improvements
Discussions continue on improving the UX and testability of the CircleCI configuration [#17184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17184). Key points include identifying high-value CI jobs for local execution (e.g., `kurtosis` and `go-tests-short`), addressing friction from prerequisite setup steps, and exploring dynamic sorting of Go tests by duration to optimize local and CI test runs. The idea of new manifest files for Go packages based on test duration and a script to update them locally was proposed.

### P2P Gossip Configuration Bug
An active discussion is ongoing regarding a bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values in `op-node/p2p/gossip` [#17308](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17308). The core problem is that zero values from CLI changes can lead to invalid configurations, causing panics in `go-libp2p-pubsub`. A potential solution discussed is adding a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to return a fully filled, valid configuration with sensible defaults, allowing tests to modify only necessary options.

### Kona + Cannon Integration and Compatibility
Discussions are active on integrating Kona + Cannon into existing tooling and ensuring compatibility. This includes verifying necessary changes in OPCM to support the new game type [#17285](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17285) and integrating Cannon + Kona into standard prestates management, with a proposed format for `standard-prestates.toml` [#17283](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17283). Additionally, compatibility testing with Go 1.25 for Cannon is underway, with the recent release of Go 1.25.1 noted [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17060).

### Sync Tester Development
The issue concerning sync tests using `op-sync-tester` and `op-acceptance-tests` is active [#16703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16703). The issue was reopened as not all HF transitions were tested. Ideas for test cases include checking every OP Stack HF transition, supporting multiple CLs with a single sync tester, and incorporating user transactions into L2 blocks for sync validation.
