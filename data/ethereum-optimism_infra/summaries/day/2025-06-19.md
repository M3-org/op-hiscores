# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Jun 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's activity primarily involved a new dependency bump for `urllib3` in `op-conductor-ops`. Discussions continued on an `op-supervisor` event overflow issue and the differences between `supersim` and `interop kurtosis devnet`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dependency Updates
A new pull request was opened to update the `urllib3` dependency from version 2.2.2 to 2.5.0 within the `/op-conductor-ops` directory. This is a routine maintenance task to ensure components use up-to-date libraries. [#410](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/410)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### op-supervisor: Event overflow on large unsafe head gap [#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16335)
Discussion continued regarding the `op-supervisor`'s potential to crash-loop due to an event overflow when the unsafe head gap grows too large. The latest comment from "nonsense" on June 19, 2025, indicates a pull request has been added to include a gauge for all in-flight events within the `GlobalSyncExec`. This aims to identify which specific event type might be causing issues if the overflow recurs. The comment also suggests setting up an alert for the total in-flight events if a certain threshold is crossed. Previous discussions debated whether `ChainIndexingContinueEvent` or `"cross-unsafe-update"` events were the primary culprits, with "nonsense" suggesting that adding a counter per event type would provide more valuable debugging data.

### What's the difference between supersim and interop kurtosis devnet? [#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/399)
The discussion on the differences between `supersim` and `interop kurtosis devnet` continued. On June 19, 2025, "zhiqiangxu" inquired about the primary use case for `supersim`, following up on a previous comment that described `supersim` as a lighter wrapper around `anvil` for local development. The issue seeks clarification on the distinct purposes of these two local devnet environments.
