# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Sep 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure with new acceptance tests and fixing issues in the `op-acceptor` package. A key dependency upgrade for `op-signer` was also completed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Acceptance Testing Framework
New basic acceptance tests were added to the `op-acceptor` package, enabling end-to-end integration testing with `op-devstack`. This includes new `Makefile` commands for execution and various test files for faucet, initialization, and RPC connectivity. ([#470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/470))

### `op-acceptor` Package Improvements
Several fixes were implemented for the `op-acceptor` package, including the addition of a default package timeout and improved logging to display package names during testing. ([#468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/468))

### `op-signer` Dependency Upgrade
The `op-signer` component received an upgrade to its Geth dependency, moving to `v1.16.2`. This update is crucial for the "fusaka defence" initiative. ([#471](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/471))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Improved Test Configuration Logging
The issue regarding logging all configuration at startup and in the HTML report for `op-acceptor` has been resolved. This enhancement provides better visibility into test configurations. ([#461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/461))

### Optimized Test Parallelism
The problem with sub-optimal parallelism in `op-acceptor`'s test execution, which prevented `t.Parallel()` from working correctly, has been addressed. ([#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/462))

## NEW ISSUES

### Streamlined Acceptance Test Execution
A new issue has been opened to address the current dependency on the monorepo for running acceptance tests. The goal is to make it easier to run these tests from external repositories, specifically by tackling challenges related to contract artifact finding. ([#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/469))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### `op-node`: Preparing for Fusaka
Discussion on [#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17493) highlights the need for `op-node` to ensure compatibility with Fusaka, particularly concerning the derivation pipeline and converting excess blob gas into L1 cost. A recent comment from geoknee emphasizes a potential challenge: tight coupling to upstream Geth code might necessitate absolute prestate updates with every upstream merge and `op-geth`/`op-node` release.
