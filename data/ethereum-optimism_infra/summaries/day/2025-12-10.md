# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Dec 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on critical bug fixes, including updating CODEOWNERS for `op-txproxy`, resolving `op-acceptor` test issues and memory leaks, and correcting `goreleaser` configurations for accurate release tracking.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-acceptor` Stability and Testing Improvements
Significant work was done to enhance the stability and testing of `op-acceptor`. This included fixing tests to properly handle CLI flags like `--help` and `--version` without triggering unnecessary validation ([#528](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/528)). Additionally, a memory leak caused by excessive subtest logging was addressed by capping log output, preventing OOM errors in CI environments ([#526](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/526)).

### Release Management and CODEOWNERS Updates
Improvements were made to release management processes by enabling `latest_release` in `goreleaser` configurations across multiple services, ensuring that GitHub repositories accurately reflect the most recent releases ([#527](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/527)). The CODEOWNERS for `op-txproxy` were also updated to correctly assign ownership to the ecosystem team ([#529](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/529)).

### Investigation into `op-node` Sequencer Recover Mode Behavior ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18350))
Discussion continued regarding a potential bug in `op-node`'s sequencer recover mode. The latest comment from `geoknee` on December 10, 2025, points to a possibly relevant PR ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)). Earlier comments from `geoknee` and `sebastianst` highlighted that when the sequencer is in recover mode but the chain is "healthy," it might request an L1 origin block that doesn't yet exist, leading to "not found" errors and a violation of the sequencer drift rule. This can cause derivation to stall if a bad batch gets on L1. `sebastianst` provided a potential code snippet to prevent temporary errors in recover mode when it catches up to the tip. `geoknee` also noted that an explicit check on sequencer drift, usually applied during normal operation, is skipped in this scenario, and is investigating the influence of async L1 origin fetching.
