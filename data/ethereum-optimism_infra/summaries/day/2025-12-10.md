# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Dec 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes across the infrastructure, including updates to CODEOWNERS, improvements to `op-acceptor` for better test stability and memory management, and corrections to `goreleaser` configurations for accurate release tracking.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### `op-acceptor` Stability and Performance Enhancements
Significant improvements were made to `op-acceptor`, addressing issues with CLI telemetry setup and memory leaks during subtest logging. These fixes enhance the reliability of tests and prevent OOM errors in CI environments.
- Fixes to `op-acceptor` tests and CLI service flag handling ([#528](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/528))
- Resolution of a memory leak in `op-acceptor` subtest logging ([#526](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/526))

### Release Management and CODEOWNERS Updates
The `goreleaser` configurations were updated across multiple services to ensure that GitHub repositories correctly display the latest releases. Additionally, the CODEOWNERS for `op-txproxy` were updated to reflect the correct team.
- Correction of `goreleaser` configurations to display the latest releases ([#527](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/527))
- Update to `op-txproxy` CODEOWNERS ([#529](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/529))

### Possible Bug in `op-node` Sequencer Recover Mode ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18350))
Discussion continues regarding a potential bug in `op-node`'s sequencer recover mode, where the sequencer enters recover mode during normal operation and encounters "not found" errors when requesting L1 origin blocks that do not yet exist. This leads to the L1 origin not advancing and violates the sequencer drift rule, potentially stalling derivation. A recent comment by @geoknee highlights a possibly relevant PR ([https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/18233)) for further investigation. Previous discussions included a proposed fix snippet by @sebastianst to prevent temporary errors in recover mode and an analysis by @geoknee on why the temporary error persists and the potential influence of async L1 origin fetching.
