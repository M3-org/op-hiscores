# ethereum-optimism/infra Daily Update (Jul 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in the `op-acceptor` with the introduction of a gateless mode for test execution and a fix for a flaky test. Several issues were closed, including a long-standing flaky test and a deployment task.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Test Execution with Gateless Mode
A new gateless mode has been introduced in `op-acceptor` ([#428](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/428)). This feature allows `op-acceptor` to automatically discover and run all tests within a specified directory, streamlining the testing process.

### Improved Test Stability
A persistent flaky test in `op-acceptor` has been addressed and made more robust ([#430](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/430)). This fix resolves a recurring issue in CI, improving the reliability of test runs.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened on Jul 23, 2025.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolved Flaky Test
The long-standing flaky test issue in `op-acceptor` has been resolved ([#348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/348)). This fix improves the stability and reliability of CI pipelines.

### Flashblocks Deployment Completed
The task to deploy a flashblocks-websocket-proxy in op-sepolia has been successfully completed ([#16686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16686)). This deployment enhances flashblocks capabilities on the op-sepolia network.

### New Audit Task Initiated
A new issue for the 2024 Q4 Audit, specifically for a page-path, has been opened and subsequently closed, indicating initial setup or categorization ([#1701](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1701)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened on Jul 23, 2025.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Semgrep Rule for Function Naming
Issue [#15115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15115) discusses adding a semgrep rule to enforce naming conventions for private/internal (starting with underscore) and public (not starting with underscore) functions. The latest comment from `copilot-swe-agent` indicates an error encountered while attempting to work on the issue, specifically that GitHub Actions is disabled for the repository, preventing automated assistance.

### Test Target Setup/Teardown in op-acceptor
Issue [#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/375) focuses on incorporating test target setup and teardown as a concern of `op-acceptor`. The latest comment from `scharissis` highlights related pull requests ([#16550](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/16550) and [#428](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/428)) that are relevant to this discussion, indicating ongoing work or considerations for test environment management.
