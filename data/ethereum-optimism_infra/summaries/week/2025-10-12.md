# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on refining core operational tooling and resolving key configuration issues. Development included enhancements to the `op-acceptor` testing framework and a critical fix for the `op-conductor-ops` tool to ensure accurate voter assignments. On the issues front, significant progress was made by closing out work related to Data Availability (DA) footprint limit testing and adjusting the Sepolia sequencer configuration. However, a new high-priority issue emerged concerning an `op-conductor` startup failure, which will require attention.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the reliability and correctness of internal tooling and testing processes.

- **Tooling and Testing Refinements:**
  - The `op-acceptor` component was updated with stricter exclusion gates, ensuring that all tests within a blacklisted gate are excluded, which refines the test selection logic ([#490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/490)).
  - A bug fix was merged for the `op-conductor-ops` tool, correcting a typo that incorrectly assumed any new member added was a voter. This ensures more precise conductor configuration ([#492](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/492)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of several testing and configuration tasks, alongside the emergence of a new potential blocker for sequencer operations.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Data Availability Footprint Limit:** Two issues related to the DA footprint limit were closed, marking the completion of an acceptance test ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17278)) and the addition of unit tests to `op-geth` ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17395)).
  - **Sepolia Sequencer Configuration:** An issue to adjust the Sepolia sequencer set was resolved. The final action involved removing `prod-sepolia-op-opn-geth-f-sunnyseq-1` from the voter set instead of the initially targeted sequencer ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17683)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Sequencer Startup Failure:** A critical new issue was reported where `op-conductor` fails to start a sequencer with a "no unsafe head" error after being linked ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17899)).
  - **Jovian Operator Fee:** Discussion is ongoing regarding the use of saturating math in the `operatorFee` getter, with recent analysis suggesting it may not be necessary ([#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17888)).
  - **Replica Healthchecks:** A discussion on monitoring for replica-healthchecks ([#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17686)) clarified that the implementation is blocked and falls under infrastructure scope, not `op-conductor`.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community interaction was highlighted by maintainer guidance on contribution scope. In the discussion around replica-healthcheck monitoring ([#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17686)), a maintainer clarified the intended scope of the issue and reinforced the process of coordinating with the team before beginning implementation. This interaction helps ensure contributor efforts are aligned with project priorities and technical direction.
