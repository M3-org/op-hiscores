# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity focused on operational stability and refinement of core infrastructure components. Key developments included a critical fix to the `op-conductor-ops` tool to correct voter assignment logic and an enhancement to the `op-acceptor` to improve test blacklisting. Significant progress was also made in resolving outstanding issues, with several closed related to DA Footprint Limit testing and Sepolia sequencer configuration. A newly identified sequencer startup failure in `op-conductor` has emerged as a key area for investigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the reliability and correctness of operational tooling and testing processes.

- **Conductor Operations Fix:** A bug fix was merged for the `op-conductor-ops` tool to correct a typo that caused new members to always be assigned as voters. This change ensures the tool's logic for member roles is accurate ([#492](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/492)).

- **Test Process Refinement:** The `op-acceptor` component was enhanced with stricter exclusion gates. This change ensures that all tests within a specified gate are blacklisted, refining the test exclusion logic and improving the integrity of the testing process ([#490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/490)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of several configuration and testing tasks, while new discussions centered on sequencer health and contract logic.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **DA Footprint Limit:** Two issues were closed, marking the completion of an acceptance test ([#17278](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17278)) and unit tests in `op-geth` ([#17395](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17395)) for the DA Footprint Limit feature.
    - **Sepolia Sequencer Configuration:** An issue regarding the sequencer set on Sepolia was resolved by updating which sequencer would be removed from the voter set, finalizing a configuration change ([#17683](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17683)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Sequencer Startup Failure:** A new high-priority issue was opened concerning an `op-conductor` failing to start a sequencer with a "no unsafe head" error ([#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17899)). This is currently under investigation.
    - **Replica Healthcheck Monitoring:** Discussion on issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17686) clarified that the implementation is blocked and resides on the infrastructure side, not within the scope of `op-conductor`. A related PR was closed with guidance for contributors to coordinate with maintainers before starting work.
    - **Jovian Operator Fee:** An ongoing discussion in [#17888](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17888) is revisiting the need for saturating math in the `operatorFee` getter, with recent analysis suggesting it may not be necessary.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the active management of issues and contributions. In issue [#17686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17686), a maintainer provided clear guidance on contribution scope and process, closing a PR and directing the contributor to discuss assignments first. Additionally, the report of a new sequencer failure in [#17899](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17899) showed direct communication between a user and a team member to begin troubleshooting. These interactions highlight a healthy feedback loop between maintainers and the community to ensure efforts are well-aligned.
