# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts focused on enhancing infrastructure reliability and tackling key integration challenges for the expanding Superchain ecosystem. Significant progress was made in improving service performance with a new rate-limiting feature in `proxyd`, alongside proactive CI/CD maintenance to ensure stability. Concurrently, active discussions centered on critical issues for ecosystem partners, including resolving a `rollupConfig` marshaling bug affecting zk stacks and advancing the integration of alternative data availability solutions with the Celestia team. These parallel efforts highlight a dual focus on strengthening the core infrastructure while actively supporting the diverse needs of projects building on the OP Stack.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on proactive maintenance and service enhancements to improve the stability and performance of the core infrastructure.

- **`proxyd` Service Enhancement:** To improve performance and prevent abuse, the `proxyd` service was updated to allow configuration of a maximum block range for resource-intensive RPC requests like `eth_getLogs` ([#494](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/494)).

- **Infrastructure and CI/CD Maintenance:** Several proactive updates were merged to maintain system health. The `op-acceptor` documentation was updated and its runner path semantics were refined ([#496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/496)). In anticipation of an upcoming platform change, CircleCI jobs were switched to use blobless checkout, ensuring the continued stability of the integration pipeline ([#497](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/497)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
This week saw the resolution of several documentation and infrastructure issues, while new discussions focused on compatibility, testing, and L3 configuration.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Documentation & Testing:** Several issues related to broken internal documentation links were fixed ([#1797](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1797), [#1802](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1802)). An older issue requesting more end-to-end tests for `op-deployer` was closed, as recent work has sufficiently addressed this need ([#16842](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16842)).
    - **Infrastructure Fixes:** An issue causing a 30-second timeout on the Flashblocks websocket URL, related to Cloudflare and GCP, was resolved ([#17858](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17858)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Alternative Data Availability (AltDA):** Significant discussion continued around integrating alternative DA solutions. The `op-batcher`'s incorrect max frame size limitation is being addressed, with a PR from the Celestia team now open to upstream the fix ([#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17796), [#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17872)).
    - **Ecosystem Compatibility:** A critical discussion is ongoing regarding a `rollupConfig` marshaling issue that is breaking some third-party zk stacks ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17907)). The conversation highlights the need for careful versioning to support the broader ecosystem.
    - **Test Stability & L3 Configuration:** Active discussions are underway to resolve race conditions in `op-devstack` acceptance tests by ensuring tests use unique, funded wallets ([#18063](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18063)). Additionally, ideas are being explored to allow `op-node` to automatically detect and configure itself for L3s, simplifying the developer experience ([#18070](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18070)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration with the broader Superchain ecosystem was a prominent theme this week. The active effort to upstream a fix for the `op-batcher` from the Celestia team ([#17872](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17872)) demonstrates a healthy, cross-organizational partnership. Furthermore, the detailed discussion around the `rollupConfig` issue ([#17907](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17907)) shows direct engagement with third-party developers (e.g., zk stacks) to address compatibility challenges, reinforcing the project's commitment to supporting the wider community.
