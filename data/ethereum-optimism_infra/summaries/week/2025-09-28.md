# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Sep 28 - 4, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked a major milestone with the successful rollout of Flashblocks on op-mainnet, a culmination of efforts that included deployment, load testing, and comprehensive documentation. The team also formally concluded the Isthmus Upgrade by closing its main tracking issue. Significant enhancements were made to core infrastructure tooling, with `proxyd` receiving a critical build fix and improved transaction logging, while the `op-acceptor` testing framework saw multiple upgrades to improve logging and test execution flexibility. These developments underscore a strong focus on enhancing network reliability, developer experience, and observability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the reliability and observability of core services and testing infrastructure.

- **`proxyd` Reliability and Observability:**
  - A build process bug was fixed by ensuring `mise` is installed for every release, guaranteeing the Go binary is available and improving the reliability of `proxyd` releases ([#479](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/479)).
  - To enhance debugging and monitoring, comprehensive logging was added for `eth_sendRawTransaction` and `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` requests, now including details like transaction hash, request ID, and chain ID ([#481](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/481)).

- **Testing Framework (`op-acceptor`) Enhancements:**
  - The logging output of `op-acceptor` was cleaned up by replacing a custom ANSI stripper with a more robust solution ([#478](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/478)).
  - A new feature was added to allow environment variables to be passed to `go test`, enabling more flexible and controlled test execution ([#483](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/483)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on closing out major initiatives, resolving synchronization bugs, and identifying potential future blockers.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Flashblocks Rollout Completion:** A series of issues related to Flashblocks were closed, signifying the project's completion. This included the successful deployment and spin-up of a flashblocks-rpc node ([#16764](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16764)), enabling it on op-mainnet ([#16498](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16498)), completing load tests ([#17462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17462)), refining alerts and runbooks ([#17423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17423)), and publishing on-call documentation and a deep-dive blog post ([#17142](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17142), [#17664](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17664)).
  - **Protocol Upgrades and Synchronization:** The main tracking issue for the Isthmus Upgrade was closed, marking the formal completion of the upgrade ([#12703](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/12703)). Additionally, an investigation into L2CL/L2EL sync conditions was concluded ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17628)), and a race condition in the `op-node`'s EL sync code path was fixed ([#17564](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17564)).
  - **`op-acceptor` Improvements:** Several issues for the testing tool were resolved, including improvements to package parallelism ([#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/462)) and adding setup information to HTML output ([#386](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/386)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Cannon/Go 1.25 Compatibility:** A significant discussion is ongoing in [#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17060) regarding an issue where Go 1.25 causes incorrect Keccak hashes when running in Cannon. This has been confirmed to affect Optimism and is being tracked as a potential blocker.
  - **`op-reth` Integration Strategy:** In [#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17475), the strategy for re-integrating `op-reth` has shifted. Following the deprecation of the Kurtosis devnet, the new focus is on integrating it into the devstack/sysgo system.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
- Collaborative problem-solving was evident in discussions around key technical challenges. The L2CL/L2EL sync conditions issue ([#17628](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17628)) saw detailed input from contributors @pcw109550, @sebastianst, and @ajsutton before its resolution.
- The active investigation into the Cannon/Go 1.25 compatibility bug ([#17060](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17060)) also highlights cross-contributor engagement, with @ajsutton, @pauldowman, and @sebastianst working to diagnose the impact on Optimism.
- The team demonstrated responsiveness to developer needs with the rapid turnaround on the `op-acceptor` feature request. A new issue to forward environment variables ([#482](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/482)) was opened and resolved with a merged pull request ([#483](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/483)) within a day.
