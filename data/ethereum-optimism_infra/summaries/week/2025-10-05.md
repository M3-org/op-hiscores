# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the robustness and security of the infrastructure's monitoring and validation components. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid for future improvements. A new pull request aims to tighten the filtering logic in the `op-acceptor`, and a critical discussion emerged around improving the `op-dispute-mon`'s resilience to out-of-sync nodes. This focus on refining core systems highlights an ongoing commitment to protocol security and reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No pull requests were completed or merged during this reporting period. However, new work was initiated to improve core validation components.

A new pull request, [#490](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/490), was opened to introduce stricter exclusion gates within the `op-acceptor`. This change is intended to improve the component's filtering capabilities and overall security posture.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week. The primary focus was on a significant active issue concerning the dispute monitoring system.

- **New & Active Issues:** A key discussion unfolded in issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17814) regarding the `op-dispute-mon` component. It was identified that the monitor can incorrectly flag a disagreement if one of its configured rollup RPCs is out of sync, creating false positives. The proposed solution involves using `syncStatus` to determine the true L2 head across all nodes and ignoring results from nodes that are significantly behind. The discussion also noted the complexity of this approach, as simply trusting the node with the highest block number could be risky if that node is on an incorrect fork, suggesting a more robust solution is needed.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was characterized by deep technical analysis of core infrastructure components. The active discussion on issue [#17814](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17814) demonstrates a focused effort to identify and solve complex edge cases in the dispute monitoring system. This proactive problem-solving on potential vulnerabilities reflects a healthy and security-conscious contributor community.
