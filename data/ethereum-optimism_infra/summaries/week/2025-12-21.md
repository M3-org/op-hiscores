# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development focused heavily on enhancing infrastructure reliability and streamlining CI/CD processes. Significant improvements were proposed for `proxyd` with the addition of graceful shutdown, healthcheck, and drain functionalities. The migration of Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions also moved forward, aiming to unify the continuous integration pipeline. Concurrently, progress was made on core components, with the `op-node` light client implementation for following external sources now complete and ongoing validation for `op-challenger` trace outputs.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on foundational infrastructure improvements to increase stability and developer efficiency.

- **`proxyd` Reliability Enhancements:** A series of pull requests were opened to bolster the `proxyd` service. One PR introduced a graceful server shutdown mechanism to ensure smoother operations ([#533](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/533)). Another, forked from Uniswap's implementation, added crucial healthcheck and drain functionality to improve service management and reliability ([#534](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/534)).

- **CI/CD Streamlining:** A key effort to improve the development pipeline was made with a pull request to complete the migration of Docker builds from CircleCI to GitHub Actions ([#532](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/532)). This move aims to consolidate and simplify the project's continuous integration processes.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed this week, but there was significant progress on key active issues.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`op-node` Light Client:** Progress was noted on issue [#18317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18317), with confirmation that the `op-node` implementation for following an external source for safe/finalized data is now complete. This feature will enable nodes to mirror external feeds via the `--l2.follow.source` flag.
    - **`op-challenger` Trace Output:** Discussion continued in issue [#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18643) regarding the correct trace output when a super root is not found. It was confirmed that the functionality works as expected in the super node trace provider. The issue remains open pending an integration test to ensure alignment between `op-challenger` and `op-program`. It was also decided that `op-supervisor` will not be fixed as it is slated for deletion.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the ongoing technical discussions within active issues, particularly the coordination required for the `op-challenger` trace output validation ([#18643](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18643)), which involves multiple components. Additionally, the new `proxyd` healthcheck feature ([#534](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/534)) being forked from a Uniswap implementation highlights positive cross-pollination of ideas and code within the broader ecosystem.
