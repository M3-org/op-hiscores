# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were heavily concentrated on preparing the infrastructure for the upcoming Fusaka hard fork and bolstering the project's testing capabilities. Key components like `proxyd` and `op-signer` were updated to support post-Fusaka blob transactions, a critical step for network readiness. Concurrently, the `op-acceptor` testing framework received significant enhancements, including new end-to-end tests, improved configuration visibility, and bug fixes. The team also resolved several important issues, including the completion of Flashblocks load testing and the standardization of address structs, while initiating a crucial discussion on creating a new convention for network upgrade transactions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on Fusaka readiness, testing improvements, and service stability.

### Fusaka Upgrade Readiness
To ensure compatibility with the upcoming Fusaka hard fork, several components were updated to handle new transaction types:
- **`proxyd` Blob Transaction Support:** The `proxyd` service was upgraded to support post-Fusaka blob transactions and cell proofs. This update also included upgrading Geth and monorepo versions and fixing a panic on ingesting pre-EIP-155 transactions ([#464](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/464)).
- **`op-signer` Dependency Upgrade:** The `op-signer` component's Geth dependency was upgraded to `v1.16.2` as part of the "fusaka defence" initiative, ensuring its compatibility with the fork ([#471](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/471)).

### `op-acceptor` Testing Framework Improvements
The acceptance testing suite saw substantial enhancements to improve usability, coverage, and reliability:
- **New Acceptance Tests:** Basic end-to-end acceptance tests were added to the `op-acceptor` package, integrating with `op-devstack` to test faucet, initialization, and RPC connectivity ([#470](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/470)).
- **Enhanced Configuration Visibility:** `op-acceptor` now logs a summary of its effective configuration on startup and in HTML reports, and can output the configuration as a JSON file for easier debugging ([#463](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/463)).
- **Bug Fixes:** A default package timeout was added and logging was improved to display package names during testing ([#468](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/468)).

### `proxyd` Stability and Observability
The `proxyd` service received key updates to improve its robustness and monitoring:
- **Stability Fix:** A flaky multicall test was resolved by modifying a function to use a thread-safe method, ensuring more reliable test execution ([#472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/472)).
- **Improved RPC Metrics:** RPC error metrics were refined for better Prometheus reporting by changing "unknown" error states to "method_not_allowed," enhancing observability ([#465](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/465)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
Several key initiatives and problems were resolved this week:
- **Testing and Analysis:** Critical testing and analysis tasks were completed, including the successful load testing of Flashblocks on `eris-0` ([#16756](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16756), [#16765](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16765)) and the finalization of the threat model for the DA Footprint Limit ([#336](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/336)).
- **`op-acceptor` Fixes:** Issues related to suboptimal test parallelism ([#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/462)) and configuration logging ([#461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/461)) in `op-acceptor` were addressed.
- **Code Standardization:** A long-standing effort to consolidate duplicated address structs across various packages was completed, establishing a single source of truth ([#14977](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/14977)).
- **Fusaka Preparation:** An issue to prepare `proxyd` for Fusaka activation ([#467](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/467)) was swiftly closed by the work in PR [#464](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/464).

### New & Active Issues
Discussions this week centered on future standards, ongoing test flakiness, and Fusaka compatibility challenges:
- **New Convention for Upgrade Transactions:** A significant new issue was opened to establish a more robust and standardized convention for network upgrade transactions that deploy new contracts ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/781)). This immediately sparked a detailed technical discussion on ensuring address collision resistance.
- **Persistent Test Flakiness:** The flakiness of `TestPreNoInbox` in `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17298)) remains an ongoing challenge, as a recent attempted fix was confirmed to be unsuccessful.
- **Fusaka Compatibility Concerns:** An active discussion on preparing `op-node` for Fusaka ([#17493](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17493)) highlighted a potential challenge with tight coupling to upstream Geth code, which could complicate future updates.
- **Tooling Improvement:** A new issue was created to make it easier to run acceptance tests from external repositories by addressing challenges with contract artifact discovery ([#469](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/469)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week demonstrated proactive and coordinated work, particularly around the Fusaka upgrade, where issues were identified and resolved quickly. There was strong evidence of deep technical collaboration in issue discussions. For instance, the new proposal for network upgrade transaction conventions ([#781](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/781)) received immediate and detailed analysis from community members like `@protolambda`. The persistent, collaborative debugging on the flaky `op-acceptance-tests` ([#17298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17298)) further highlights the team's commitment to resolving complex issues together.
