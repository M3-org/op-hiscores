# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on refining infrastructure strategy, finalizing key parameters for the upcoming Jovian upgrade, and initiating new feature development. A significant amount of work involved closing out long-standing issues related to tooling and validation processes, reflecting a strategic shift away from tools like Kurtosis and a move towards a report-based approach for chain validations. While no major features were merged, development began on enhancing `proxyd` with new security and configuration options, and progress was made on diagnosing an active issue related to genesis block gas scalars.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
While the week focused more on issue triage and planning than on merging new code, development work was initiated on key infrastructure components.

### `proxyd` Enhancements
Two new pull requests were opened to improve the functionality and security of `proxyd`:
- A feature to verify that the last X-Forwarded-For (XFF) IP matches the client IP was proposed to enhance security ([#495](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/495)).
- A change to allow the configuration of the maximum block range for RPC requests was introduced, giving operators more control over node resources ([#494](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/494)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management was a primary focus, with numerous issues closed as part of strategic finalizations and process improvements.

### Closed Issues
- **Jovian Upgrade Finalization:** Key parameters for the Jovian upgrade were locked in. This included finalizing the upgrade transactions' bytecode ([#772](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/772)) and setting the default value for the `daFootprintGasScalar` ([#773](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/773)).
- **Infrastructure & Process Refinements:** Several issues were closed due to strategic shifts. This includes deprecating investment in Kurtosis tooling ([#16975](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16975)), moving away from Discord-based faucets ([#12952](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/12952)), and streamlining Superchain Registry validation to a report-based system ([#689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/689), [#696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/696)). An issue to rewire the `interopgen` config was also closed as "won't fix" due to evolving testing practices ([#17614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17614)).

### New & Active Issues
- No new issues were opened this week.
- **DA Footprint Limit Investigation ([#17946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17946)):** Progress was made on an issue where the first block after genesis incorrectly had a zero gas scalar. The root cause was identified as an issue with how the genesis SystemConfig was populated, and a fix has been implemented in a corresponding pull request.
- **Dispute Game Validator ([#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17267)):** An issue to update a validator for new dispute game contracts was closed but subsequently reopened, indicating that tests are still being skipped and further work is required.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The development activity reflects a strong internal focus on strategic alignment and issue resolution. The process of closing, and in one case reopening, issues like the dispute game validator update ([#17267](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17267)) demonstrates an active internal review and testing loop ensuring that fixes are complete before final closure.
