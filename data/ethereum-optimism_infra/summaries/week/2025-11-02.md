# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity focused on resolving outstanding issues and preparing for future enhancements. Several long-standing issues concerning `proxyd` interop message validation and a flaky acceptance test were successfully closed, improving system stability and test reliability. While no new code was merged, a new pull request was opened to expand RPC method mappings. Additionally, an important discussion continued around the `op-batcher`'s behavior with altDA, suggesting a potential need for a specification update.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Based on the provided data, no new features, bug fixes, or refactoring efforts were merged this week. However, new work was initiated to improve RPC functionality.

*   **RPC Method Mapping Expansion**
    A new pull request, [#504](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/504), was opened to add all potential RPC method mappings, laying the groundwork for more comprehensive RPC support.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week centered on closing out persistent problems and advancing discussions on core component behavior.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **`proxyd` Interop Validation:** Two key issues, [#364](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/364) and [#365](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/365), related to load testing and observability for `proxyd` interop message validation were closed, marking a milestone in the feature's maturity.
    *   **Test Suite Stability:** Issue [#17548](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17548) was closed after confirmation that the flaky `TestL2CLAheadOfSupervisor` in `op-acceptance-tests` is no longer a recurring problem.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   No new issues were opened this week.
    *   A significant discussion continued in [#17796](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17796) regarding the `op-batcher`. The conversation highlights that the batcher does not limit frame size in generic mode for altDA, leading to a suggestion that the specification's statement about `MAX_L1_TX_SIZE` may need to be updated.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active discussion on issue [#17796], where contributors `nuke-web3`, `tessr`, and `sebastianst` engaged in a technical dialogue about the `op-batcher`'s frame size limits. The resolution of the flaky test issue [#17548] also demonstrated effective follow-through, with `alfonso-op` confirming the fix's success based on monitoring flaky test data.
