# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the stability and functionality of core infrastructure components. Significant progress was made on the `op-acceptor` testing framework, with the introduction of a new "gateless" execution mode and fixes for several long-standing flaky tests, improving CI reliability. The team also advanced the `flashblocks` initiative by completing a key deployment on op-sepolia and refining monitoring strategies. Concurrently, work on the `op-ufm` package improved transaction error handling, and several older technical debt issues were closed, signaling a productive week of both new development and system cleanup.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving the project's testing framework and refining transaction handling logic.

*   **Testing Framework (`op-acceptor`) Enhancements:** A series of updates significantly improved the `op-acceptor` test suite's usability and reliability.
    *   A new "gateless" mode was introduced, allowing the framework to automatically discover and run all tests in a directory, streamlining the execution process ([#428](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/428)).
    *   Two separate fixes addressed flaky tests, one resolving a persistent CI failure ([#430](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/430)) and another correcting improper exit codes for runtime errors ([#431](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/431)).

*   **Transaction Handling (`op-ufm`) Refinements:** The `op-ufm` package saw iterative improvements to how it manages transaction errors.
    *   Initially, logging was added to record "transaction not found" errors as a preliminary step ([#433](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/433)).
    *   This was followed by a functional change to ignore these specific errors, refining the system's behavior ([#437](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/437)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving long-standing bugs, advancing the `flashblocks` deployment, and clearing out technical debt.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Test Reliability:** In line with the development work, two issues related to `op-acceptor` instability were closed: a long-standing flaky test ([#348](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/348)) and a bug causing incorrect exit codes in CI ([#244](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/244)).
    *   **Flashblocks Progress:** The deployment of a `flashblocks-websocket-proxy` on op-sepolia was completed ([#16686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16686)). Strategic issues for enabling flashblocks non-publicly ([#16496](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16496)) and configuring a reth-enabled node ([#16544](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16544)) were closed in favor of new, more focused tasks.
    *   **Technical Debt:** Two older issues were resolved: one for improving the supervisor's reset target mechanism ([#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16314)) and another for creating a reusable logger utility ([#15139](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15139)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **New:** A feature request was opened to allow configurable test skips in `op-acceptor` ([#434](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/434)), as currently skipped tests are counted as failures.
    *   **Active:** A detailed discussion is ongoing in [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16388) to define comprehensive monitoring and alerting for the `flashblocks` integration on op-sepolia, outlining specific metrics and SLAs.
    *   **Blockers:** An attempt to add a `semgrep` rule for function naming conventions ([#15115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15115)) was blocked because GitHub Actions is disabled for the repository, preventing automated assistance.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the focused, iterative improvements made to key components like `op-acceptor` and `op-ufm`. The detailed planning for `flashblocks` monitoring in issue [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16388) highlights deep technical discussion and specification work ahead of implementation. The closure of issue [#16314](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16314) after referencing related PRs in the `optimism` repository demonstrates effective cross-repository coordination. Finally, the use of automated tooling like `copilot-swe-agent` on issue [#15115](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15115) shows an interest in leveraging modern development aids, even when encountering environmental constraints.
