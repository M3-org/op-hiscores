# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant progress in protocol specification and architectural planning, alongside substantial housekeeping efforts. The most notable achievement was the finalization and closure of the `min-base-fee` specification, marking a key step for a planned protocol feature. Concurrently, a critical discussion emerged around deprecating the `req-resp` P2P sync in `op-node`, with a detailed alternative proposed to improve sync stability and performance. The team also focused on reducing technical debt by closing numerous issues related to logging, event systems, and runbook refactoring.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The week's code contributions focused on routine maintenance, ensuring the stability and security of project dependencies.

*   **Dependency Maintenance**: A dependency update was merged for the `op-acceptor` component, bumping `github.com/ulikunitz/xz` to version 0.5.14 to incorporate the latest fixes and improvements ([#451](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/451)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was a primary focus, with several key issues resolved and important strategic discussions taking place in active issues. No new issues were opened this week.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   **Protocol Specification Finalized**: The specification for `min-base-fee` was formally written and ratified, bringing issue [#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/742) to a close.
    *   **System Cleanup and Simplification**: A significant cleanup effort resulted in the closure of several issues. The team decided against implementing consensus-influencing event nonces ([#13543](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/13543)) and adding an event call graph ([#16874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16874)), leaning towards removing the event system entirely. Efforts to clean up logging in `op-up` ([#17007](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17007)) and refactor the upgrade runbook ([#347](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/347)) were also concluded.
    *   **Operational Housekeeping**: The postmortem for a Scalar fix ([#17012](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17012)) and an investigation into missing test logs ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17151)) were closed as completed.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **`op-node` Sync Mechanism Debate**: A major discussion is underway in [#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/14108) regarding the deprecation of the `req-resp` P2P sync mechanism to solve persistent sync problems. A detailed alternative was proposed by @emilianobonassi, suggesting a simpler, faster, and more reliable method where the sequencer publishes the latest unsafe block via Redis, and other nodes subscribe to it. This approach aims to bypass issues with UDP, domain names, and race conditions found in the current protocol.
    *   **CI and Documentation Improvements**: Discussions continued on improving the developer experience. In [#665](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/665), the team is exploring options for a periodic CI job to catch integration issues with `op-geth` sooner. In [#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1530), the focus is on improving `op-deployer` documentation, with a "rich PR" in the docs repository highlighted as a major overhaul for chain operators.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
While light on new code, the week was heavy on collaboration and strategic planning. The discussion around deprecating `req-resp` sync in `op-node` ([#14108](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/14108)) showcased deep technical engagement, with a comprehensive alternative prototyped and proposed by a contributor. Similarly, the effort to improve `op-deployer` documentation ([#1530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1530)) demonstrated active collaboration between multiple team members and across repositories, reflecting a strong focus on improving the experience for external ecosystem participants.
