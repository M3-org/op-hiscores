# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Nov 23 - 29, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity centered on infrastructure maintenance, testing validation, and community-driven documentation improvements. A key milestone was the confirmation of `op-reth`'s successful integration into the acceptance test suite, solidifying a recent development effort. While core development was limited to minor code refactoring, significant community engagement emerged to address and correct outdated documentation, highlighting a collaborative effort to improve resources for developers and node operators.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving the existing codebase and validating integrations.

- **Code Refinement**
  A pull request ([#518](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/518)) was opened to refactor a small portion of the code. The change aims to improve clarity and maintainability by removing an unnecessary variable reassignment.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of a key integration task and active community participation in fixing documentation.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **`op-reth` Integration Confirmed:** Issue [#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17475) was closed, confirming that `op-reth` has been successfully re-added to the `op-acceptance-test` for the Jovian kt-devnet and is running in `op-rs/kona` acceptance tests.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were opened this week.
  - **Documentation Improvements:** Two active issues are being addressed by a community member. Issue [#1657](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1657) points out incorrect Docker image references in the release documentation, while [#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1874) notes the absence of environment variable descriptions for `op-node` and `op-geth` flags.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week showcased positive community health and collaboration. A community member, `yasnazariel`, proactively volunteered to work on two separate documentation issues ([#1657](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1657), [#1874](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1874)). This initiative to correct inaccuracies and fill information gaps demonstrates valuable external contribution to the project's ecosystem and developer experience.
