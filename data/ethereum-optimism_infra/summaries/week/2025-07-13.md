# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push to enhance the project's testing infrastructure and resolve long-standing issues. A major effort culminated in the successful porting of numerous acceptance tests to `devstack`, improving test consistency and maintainability. Key infrastructure decisions were made regarding sequencer configurations, and a critical bug in `op-acceptor` was fixed to ensure accurate test duration reporting. The team also began laying the groundwork for future initiatives, including a migration to Blockscout and efforts to align test environments more closely with production topology.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving test reporting, managing dependencies, and proposing new authentication features.

- **Test Reporting Improvement:** A bug in `op-acceptor` that caused failed test runs to report a zero duration was fixed in [#425](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/425). This change ensures that all test runs, regardless of their outcome, report a non-zero duration, leading to more accurate and reliable test metrics.

- **New Functionality & Dependencies:**
    - A new pull request, [#424](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/424), was opened to enable public access and authentication, signaling a move towards more robust access control.
    - A dependency update for `golang.org/x/oauth2` was submitted via [#427](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/427) to keep components current.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a substantial cleanup of the issue tracker, with a focus on closing out completed test migrations and resolving old stability concerns.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Acceptance Test Migration to Devstack:** A major milestone was reached with the closure of several issues related to porting acceptance tests to `devstack`. This includes `TestChainFork` ([#413](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/413)), `TestWithdrawalsRoot` ([#412](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/412)), `TestERC20Bridge` ([#415](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/415)), `TestOperatorFee` ([#414](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/414)), and `TestPectra` ([#416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/416)).
    - **Infrastructure Configuration Decisions:** Internal discussions concluded with the closure of two spike issues. The team decided to skip NVMe node deployment for `op-rbuilders` for now ([#16689](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16689)) and to keep flashblocks components in the same namespace as other sequencer components for simpler monitoring ([#16690](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16690)).
    - **Sequencer Stability:** Long-standing issues concerning sequencer recovery from window expiration ([#11228](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/11228)) and halting due to temporary errors ([#12240](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/12240)) were closed.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Test Environment Alignment:** A new issue, [#16746](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16746), was opened to align the local Kurtosis interop devnet topology with production, aiming to improve the fidelity of local testing.
    - **Block Explorer Migration:** Discussion is active on [#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1696) regarding the migration from Etherscan to Blockscout for OP Mainnet and OP Sepolia.
    - **Ongoing Challenges & Blockers:**
        - A persistent and hard-to-reproduce bug where invalid interop transactions are included in the `txpool` remains an active concern ([#635](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/635)).
        - An `op-geth` version bump has caused `TestExecMessageInvalidAttributes` and `TestRegularMessage` to fail, requiring them to be temporarily skipped ([#16731](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16731)).
        - The plan to enable flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers has been deprioritized ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16688)) pending stabilization on OP Labs Sepolia infrastructure.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong cross-repository and inter-team collaboration. The successful porting of numerous acceptance tests was accomplished through pull requests in the `ethereum-optimism/optimism` repository, demonstrating tight coordination between the `infra` and core development teams. Similarly, the discussion around the Etherscan-to-Blockscout migration ([#1696](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1696)) involves a parallel effort in the `ethereum-optimism/docs` repository. The decision to hand off an interop acceptance test ([#298](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/298)) to the Protocol team further illustrates effective task delegation between specialized teams.
