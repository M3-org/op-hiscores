# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Dec 1 - 3, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week saw significant progress in defining and implementing the strategy for ZK games, with the team deciding to leverage `op-challenger` and the succinct proposer, leading to the closure of numerous related issues. Infrastructure tooling also received key updates, including enhanced testing capabilities for the `op-acceptor` and standardized build processes for `replica-healthcheck`. Meanwhile, several active issues concerning `op-node` stability and `proxyd` synchronization continued to draw community attention, highlighting areas for future focus.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving infrastructure tooling and build consistency.

- **Enhanced Testing with `op-acceptor`:** The `op-acceptor` tool was upgraded to support multi-gate inputs and a dry-run option. This feature ([#520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/520)) provides greater flexibility for testing complex conditions without requiring actual execution.
- **Build Process Standardization:** To improve consistency across the project, the `replica-healthcheck` Docker image build process was aligned with other images by standardizing its build context. This change ([#521](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/521)) simplifies the CI/CD pipeline and maintenance.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The week was marked by the resolution of a major strategic question around ZK games, while user-reported issues with core components remain a key focus.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **ZK Game Challenging Strategy Finalized:** A major effort concluded with the decision to use `op-challenger` to support challenging ZK games ([#18322], [#18321]) and the succinct proposer for proof generation ([#18319]). This led to the closure of several related configuration and implementation issues ([#18427], [#18412], [#18413], [#18414], [#18415]).
    - **Rollup-Boost Configuration:** An issue was closed confirming that `rollup-boost` now correctly reverts to default EL block building under specific failure conditions ([#315]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this week.
    - **`op-node` Stability:** Multiple users confirmed experiencing issues with `op-node`, including an invalid block signature error ([#17448]) and the node getting stuck in EL sync mode on restart ([#18468]), indicating a potential stability concern for node operators.
    - **`proxyd` Synchronization:** Discussion continued on the "backwards time travel" issue ([#501]), where `proxyd` can serve stale blocks when backends are out of sync. While a fix is planned for January, brainstorming on solutions like signature-based sticky sessions is ongoing.
    - **Superchain Configuration:** Progress continues on porting the `SuperchainConfig` type from the `superchain-registry` ([#741]), with a pull request ([#867](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/867)) now open that incorporates community feedback.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
- Collaboration was evident in the `SuperchainConfig` effort ([#741]), where contributor @Himess opened a PR incorporating feedback from @emhane.
- Community members actively participated in issue validation, with multiple users confirming they were experiencing the same `op-node` problems ([#17448], [#18468]), providing valuable feedback to the maintainers.
- A new pull request ([#519](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/519)) was opened to optimize CI workflows by splitting runs for protected and unprotected branches, showing proactive efforts to improve development infrastructure.
