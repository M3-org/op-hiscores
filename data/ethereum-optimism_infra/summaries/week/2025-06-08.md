# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Jun 8 - 14, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a strong focus on enhancing infrastructure stability and reliability. Key components like `proxyd` and `op-conductor-ops` received critical bug fixes and performance improvements to bolster the network's core services. Concurrently, a significant effort was dedicated to improving the developer and operator experience through better test reporting and a concerted push to diagnose and eliminate CI flakiness. The completion of a full L2-to-L1 withdrawal flow test marks a major milestone in end-to-end system validation, while new initiatives like the Gas Tank contract signal ongoing feature development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on hardening existing services and improving the testing framework.

- **`proxyd` Enhancements:** The proxy service saw significant improvements. A performance optimization was introduced to bypass the concurrency-limiting semaphore when unlimited concurrency is configured ([#405](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/405)). A critical bug was also fixed where request size limits were checked prematurely; the check now correctly occurs after interop transaction recognition, ensuring proper handling ([#407](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/407)).

- **Sequencer and Conductor Reliability:** A crucial fix was merged for `op-conductor-ops` to prevent the bootstrap process from exiting before at least one sequencer is active, improving the robustness of sequencer operations ([#404](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/404)).

- **Test Framework and Reporting:** The `op-acceptor` test suite was improved with a new feature to display an overall pass/fail status in its HTML reports for clearer results ([#408](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/408)). A persistent test flake in `TestRealtimeLogs` was also resolved to increase the reliability of the test suite ([#409](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/409)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue tracking this week focused on resolving long-standing tests, cleaning up documentation, and initiating new efforts around core contracts and test reliability.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **End-to-End Testing:** The issue for implementing a complete L2-to-L1 withdrawal flow test was closed, confirming the successful implementation of the test covering initiation, proof, and finalization ([#327](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/327)). The acceptance test for Conductor leadership transfer was also completed and closed ([#351](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/351)).
    - **Documentation:** An issue regarding outdated documentation for the deprecated `L2OutputOracleProxy` was closed, cleaning up the testnet tutorial ([#1614](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1614)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **CI & Test Flakiness:** A major focus of discussion was on improving test reliability. A new issue was opened specifically to track and mitigate flakiness in acceptance tests ([#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16378)), complementing the ongoing investigation into broader CI flakiness, which is believed to stem primarily from infrastructure issues ([#16271](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16271)).
    - **Core Contracts & Services:** A new issue was opened to track the development of the Gas Tank contract, a key component for gas management ([#836](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/836)).
    - **Supervisor Stability:** Discussions are active around a critical `op-supervisor` crash-loop caused by event overflow when a managed node falls too far behind ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16335)). Architectural refinement is also being discussed for supervisor L1 origin handling to simplify reset logic ([#16315](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16315)).
    - **Persistent Bugs:** The issue of `eth_getTransactionCount` returning an incorrect nonce for pending transactions remains active and is awaiting an update, as it causes transactions to get stuck ([#623](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/623)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the deep technical discussions aimed at improving system architecture and reliability. Multiple team members, including `sebastianst`, `axelKingsley`, and `nonsense`, engaged in detailed analysis of the `op-supervisor`'s event handling and reset logic. The concerted effort to tackle CI flakiness, led by `scharissis`, involves detailed reporting and analysis, indicating a team-wide commitment to improving development infrastructure. Furthermore, planning for the Superchain Interop quickstart guide ([#1644](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1644)) showed cross-functional collaboration between `sbvegan`, `@bradleycamacho`, and `@krofax` on content strategy.
