# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a strong focus on stabilization and cleanup, particularly within the project's testing infrastructure. A significant code refactoring in `op-acceptor` removed over 600 lines of unused code, improving maintainability. Numerous long-standing issues related to acceptance testing, devnet tooling, and the proofs system were closed, signaling the completion of key testing milestones. While new feature development was minimal, a work-in-progress pull request for a consensus-aware proxy poller was initiated, and active discussions continued on improving validation test strategies and contract verification tooling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development effort this week involved significant code refactoring and the start of a new feature.

- **`op-acceptor` Codebase Optimization:** A major cleanup effort within the `op-acceptor` component resulted in the removal of approximately 600 lines of unused code identified by static analysis. This refactoring improves the codebase's footprint and maintainability ([#447](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/447)).
- **New Consensus Layer Poller (WIP):** A new work-in-progress pull request was opened to introduce a `consensus_aware_consensus_layer proxyd poller`. This feature is currently under active development ([#449](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/449)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw substantial progress in resolving outstanding issues, with a large number of closures focused on testing and infrastructure.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Testing & Devstack Migration:** Several issues related to porting tests from the legacy devnet SDK to Devstack were resolved, including `TestBalanceSnapshot` ([#442](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/442)) and `TestInteropReadiness` ([#443](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/443)).
    - **Acceptance Test Cleanup:** Key issues for the proofs system were closed, marking the completion of interop acceptance testing ([#15946](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15946), [#15948](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15948)). An issue to integrate test setup/teardown into `op-acceptor` was also closed as focus shifts from Kurtosis to Sysgo ([#375](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/375)).
    - **Infrastructure & Feature Completion:** The task to enable Flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers for Sepolia was completed ([#16688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16688]). A persistent devnet faucet wallet for `netchef` was implemented ([#396](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/396)), and an event system cleanup was finalized ([#17001](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17001)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Missing Test Logs:** A new issue was opened regarding missing logs for failed acceptance tests ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17151)). A quick response clarified that the tests are being moved to a different workflow, which is expected to resolve the problem.
    - **Validation Test Strategy:** Discussion continued on improving validation test coverage ([#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/686)), with recent comments suggesting a review of previously unplanned tests to see if they should be implemented.
    - **RPC Content Type:** An issue regarding missing content type headers in RPC responses ([#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/389)) saw a community member ask for guidance on how to contribute a fix.
    - **Contract Verification:** The conversation on improving contract verification ([#14813](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/14813)) is leaning towards leveraging `forge verify-contract` in the future to reduce custom code.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active discussions on several key issues. Team members like `alfonso-op`, `bitwiseguy`, and `geoknee` are coordinating on the long-term strategy for validation testing in issue [#686](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/686). The prompt clarification from `scharissis` on the new test log issue ([#17151](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17151)) demonstrates responsive maintenance. Additionally, community engagement was highlighted by contributor `OBlackmon3` proactively seeking to help resolve the RPC content type issue ([#389](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/389)).
