# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a shift from proactive stability improvements to reactive incident response. Early in the week, efforts focused on hardening core infrastructure, with key bug fixes for `op-acceptor` stability and enhancements to the release pipeline. However, the primary focus shifted mid-week to a critical, widespread node synchronization failure affecting multiple chains across the Superchain ecosystem. While dependency maintenance continued, the investigation into this "missing trie node" error became the most urgent priority for the team.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the reliability of existing services and managing dependencies, even as a major incident emerged.

- **`op-acceptor` Stability and Testing:** Significant effort was invested in making `op-acceptor` more robust. A memory leak in CI caused by excessive logging was resolved by capping log output ([#526]), and tests were fixed to correctly handle CLI flags like `--help` without triggering validation errors ([#528]).

- **Release Management & Maintenance:** The release process was improved by enabling `latest_release` in `goreleaser` configurations, ensuring that GitHub repositories accurately reflect the most recent releases ([#527]). Ownership was clarified by updating the `CODEOWNERS` for `op-txproxy` ([#529]). A dependency bump for `quic-go` in the `peer-mgmt-service` was also initiated to incorporate upstream improvements ([#530]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was dominated by a new, high-priority incident and ongoing investigation into complex protocol behavior.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Critical Node Synchronization Failures ([#18581]):** A major issue emerged with nodes across Optimism, Base, and Unichain failing to synchronize, reporting "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors. This widespread problem is a significant blocker, with initial speculation pointing towards issues with public snapshots or the need for a client update. The issue has garnered substantial attention from users across the ecosystem.
    - **`op-node` Sequencer Behavior ([#18350]):** Investigation continued into a potential bug where an `op-node` in sequencer recover mode can stall derivation. The discussion centers on how the node requests L1 origins when catching up, which may violate the sequencer drift rule and cause it to get stuck.
    - **`op-rbuilder` Health Check ([#17685]):** An active issue regarding the need for a dedicated health check for `op-rbuilder` saw positive movement, with a community member volunteering to take on the implementation.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both incident response and proactive contributions. The widespread node synchronization issue ([#18581]) spurred cross-chain collaboration, with users from Optimism, Base, and Unichain all contributing reports and context. On the contribution front, a community member, "Himess," stepped up to address the need for an `op-rbuilder` health check ([#17685]), demonstrating healthy external engagement. Internally, deep technical collaboration continued between core developers on the complex `op-node` sequencer issue ([#18350]).
