# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's focus was on enhancing infrastructure stability and addressing critical operational issues. Key efforts included bug fixes in `op-acceptor` to improve test reliability and resolve memory leaks, alongside corrections to `goreleaser` configurations for proper release visibility. A significant new issue emerged concerning node synchronization failures across multiple chains, prompting active community discussion and investigation into potential issues with L1 execution clients. While new feature development was light, the week was characterized by important maintenance, dependency updates, and collaborative troubleshooting of high-priority bugs.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the reliability and maintainability of core infrastructure components.

-   **`op-acceptor` Stability and Performance:** A series of important fixes were merged to bolster the `op-acceptor` service. These addressed a memory leak in subtest logging that could cause OOM errors in CI ([#526](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/526)) and corrected issues with CLI telemetry setup and test flag handling ([#528](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/528)), leading to more stable and reliable testing.

-   **Release Management & Housekeeping:** The team addressed release visibility by correcting `goreleaser` configurations to ensure the latest releases are properly displayed on GitHub ([#527](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/527)). Ownership was clarified by updating the CODEOWNERS file for `op-txproxy` ([#529](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/529)). A minor pull request was also opened to improve code comments and readability ([#531](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/531)).

-   **Dependency Updates:** A pull request ([#530](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/530)) was opened to upgrade the `quic-go` dependency within the `peer-mgmt-service`, keeping the project's dependencies current.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week, but significant activity occurred around new and existing issues, highlighting potential challenges in node operation and sequencer behavior.

-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Node Synchronization Failures:** A critical new issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18581)) was opened regarding widespread node synchronization problems. Users on Base, Optimism, and Unichain reported "missing trie node" and "Failed to build payload" errors, particularly when using public snapshots. The discussion points towards the L1 Execution Client failing to provide necessary state data to Op-Node, and maintainers have requested detailed client configurations and logs to diagnose the root cause.
    -   **Sequencer Recover Mode Bug:** Investigation continues on a potential bug ([#18350](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18350)) where the `op-node` sequencer incorrectly enters recover mode, potentially stalling derivation. The discussion this week involved referencing another PR that might be related to the issue.
    -   **`op-rbuilder` Health Check:** An older issue ([#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17685)) requesting a dedicated replica health check for `op-rbuilder` saw renewed interest, with a community member offering to take on the implementation.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong community engagement in identifying and troubleshooting critical issues. The node synchronization issue ([#18581](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18581)) saw rapid reporting from multiple users across different chains, enabling a coordinated diagnostic effort led by maintainers. Furthermore, the offer from a community member to address the `op-rbuilder` health check issue ([#17685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17685)) demonstrates proactive contributor involvement in improving the project's operational health.
