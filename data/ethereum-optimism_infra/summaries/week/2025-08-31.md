# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on significant infrastructure refinement and enhancing the developer experience. Key achievements include a major refactoring of the `op-acceptor` test runner for improved modularity and the introduction of `mise` to standardize tool version management across the repository. Progress was also made in stabilizing the devnet testing environment, with several long-standing test porting and setup issues being closed. Ongoing discussions are focused on resolving a critical P2P gossip configuration bug and coordinating the multi-faceted integration of the "Kona + Cannon" game type across various system components.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving the project's foundational tooling and test infrastructure rather than adding new user-facing features.

- **Test Runner and Logging Enhancements:** The `op-acceptor` component saw substantial improvements aimed at maintainability and easier debugging. The monolithic test runner was refactored into five distinct, more manageable components ([#448]). Complementing this, test logging was enhanced to produce separate plaintext, raw JSON, and summary log files for each test run, providing more granular diagnostic information ([#453]).

- **Standardized Tool Version Management:** To streamline developer setup and ensure consistent environments, `mise` was introduced for repository-wide tool version management. The initial adoption began with `op-acceptor`, `op-conductor-mon`, and `op-conductor-ops`, setting the stage for a project-wide rollout ([#452]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue tracking this week was marked by the resolution of key testing hurdles and active discussions on protocol-level bugs and future upgrades.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Devnet Testing Stabilized:** A significant milestone was reached with the closure of issues related to porting acceptance tests to Devstack ([#440], [#444]) and ensuring all tests pass in persistent devnets ([#398]). This work improves the reliability of the development and testing environment.
    - **Proposer Error Clarified:** An issue regarding an `op-proposer` error was closed with a clear explanation that the `GameAlreadyExists` error is expected behavior when the safe head has not advanced, helping to reduce user confusion ([#17042]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **P2P Gossip Configuration Bug:** A critical discussion is ongoing around a bug where `ConfigureGossip` overwrites sane defaults with zero values, leading to panics in `go-libp2p-pubsub` during tests ([#17308]). The debate centers on enforcing valid configurations by default, with a proposed solution to add a `DefaultP2PConfig` method to prevent invalid states.
    - **"Kona + Cannon" Integration:** A major focus of active discussion is the integration of the new Kona + Cannon game type. This involves coordinated efforts across multiple components, including adding support in `op-dispute-mon` ([#17286]), making necessary changes to OPCM for deployment ([#17285]), and defining the format for `standard-prestates.toml` ([#17283]).
    - **CI/CD & Test Coverage:** Discussions continue on improving the developer experience for CI/CD ([#17184]) and expanding the `op-sync-tester` to cover all Hard Fork transitions, an issue that was reopened to ensure complete test coverage ([#16703]).
    - **Recurring `op-geth` Error:** Users continue to report an "head block is not reachable" error during `op-geth` initialization, indicating a persistent pain point in the user setup experience that may require further investigation ([#420]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly visible this week through in-depth discussions on complex technical issues. The P2P gossip bug ([#17308]) sparked a detailed technical exchange between contributors, who worked together to diagnose the root cause related to dependency updates and propose robust solutions.

Similarly, the planning for "Kona + Cannon" integration shows strong coordination between core developers across multiple issues ([#17286], [#17285]), ensuring that different parts of the infrastructure are prepared for the upcoming changes. The recurring `op-geth` issue ([#420]) also highlights community engagement, with users sharing workarounds and experiences, signaling an area where official documentation or a code fix could provide significant value.
