# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by significant housekeeping and issue triage rather than new feature development. The primary focus was on cleaning up the project's backlog, resulting in the closure of numerous long-standing issues related to acceptance testing, test stability, and older infrastructure problems. This effort signals a strategic move to reduce maintenance overhead and clarify the current state of testing infrastructure, including the deprecation of the "KT" devnet. While no new code was merged, active discussions are underway to reassess the priority and relevance of ongoing initiatives like the `min-base-fee` feature and `op-reth` integration.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
There were no new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, or documentation enhancements merged this week. All development activity was focused on project management and issue backlog maintenance.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The week's efforts centered on managing the issue tracker, with a large volume of closures and active discussions on remaining items.

- **Closed Issues:** A substantial cleanup effort resolved dozens of older issues, grouped into several key themes:
    - **Acceptance Test Suite Cleanup:** A large batch of issues for `op-devstack` acceptance tests were closed, covering core functionalities like block proposal latency, node recovery, cross-domain messaging, and bridge congestion ([#329](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/329)-[#335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/335), [#345](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/345)). This indicates either the completion or deprecation of these specific testing initiatives.
    - **Test Stability and Deprecation:** Several issues concerning test flakiness and outdated infrastructure were closed. This included the formal deprecation of the "KT" devnet ([#15782](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15782)), the resolution of a flaky `TestChannelManager_Memory` test ([#17525](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17525)), and an issue regarding test parallelization ([#17966](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17966)).
    - **Stale Infrastructure Bugs:** Old issues related to an `op-node` goroutine leak ([#16332](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16332)), `op-geth` state DB corruption ([#549](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/549]), and Engine API compliance ([#596](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/596)) were closed, as they were presumed resolved in more recent releases.

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. The focus remains on triaging existing ones:
    - **Reopened Work:** An issue to fix a hardcoded address book in `op-devstack` ([#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15817)) was reopened, indicating that pending work remains.
    - **Strategic Re-evaluation:** Discussions are ongoing to determine the current relevance of several initiatives. This includes verifying the effectiveness of the `min-base-fee` feature ([#16958](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16958), [#16959](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16959)) and defining the integration path for `op-reth` into the test suite now that the Kurtosis devnet is deprecated ([#17475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17475)).
    - **Ongoing Flakiness:** A flaky test, `TestBreakTimestampInvariant` ([#18137](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/18137)), continues to be tracked.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident through active issue management and discussion. Team members like @mslipper were seen driving the triage process, checking in with others such as @geoknee and @theochap to clarify the status of older issues. This collaborative cleanup effort is crucial for maintaining project health and ensuring development focus is aligned with current priorities. The reopening of issue [#15817](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15817) by @ajsutton also highlights the team's diligence in ensuring tasks are fully completed.
