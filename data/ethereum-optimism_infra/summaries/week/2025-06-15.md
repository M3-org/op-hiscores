# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on infrastructure maintenance and diagnostics. A routine dependency update was initiated for `op-conductor-ops` to ensure components remain current. Significant discussion continued around improving the stability of `op-supervisor`, with a focus on adding better monitoring to diagnose a potential event overflow issue. Additionally, ongoing conversations aimed to clarify the distinct use cases for local development environments, highlighting an effort to improve developer experience and tooling documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development activity involved routine maintenance to keep the infrastructure's dependencies up-to-date.

- **Dependency Maintenance:** A pull request ([#410](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/410)) was opened to upgrade the `urllib3` dependency from version 2.2.2 to 2.5.0 for `op-conductor-ops`.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened and no existing issues were closed based on the provided reports. However, there was notable activity on key ongoing issues related to system stability and developer tooling.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved this week according to the available data.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`op-supervisor` Stability ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16335))**: Discussion continued on a critical issue where `op-supervisor` can crash-loop due to an event overflow when the unsafe head gap becomes too large. A proposal was made to add a gauge to monitor all in-flight events, which would help identify the specific event type causing the overflow and allow for proactive alerting.
    - **Developer Tooling Clarification ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/399))**: The conversation about the differences between `supersim` and the `interop kurtosis devnet` continued. Community members are seeking to understand the primary use cases for each local development environment, signaling a need for clearer documentation around developer tooling.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this period was evident through active discussions within GitHub issues. In the `op-supervisor` event overflow issue ([#16335](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16335)), contributors are collaboratively diagnosing the problem and proposing concrete monitoring solutions. Similarly, the discussion around local devnet environments ([#399](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/399)) shows active engagement from the community to better understand and utilize the project's tools.
