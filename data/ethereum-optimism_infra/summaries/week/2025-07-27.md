# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the project's core tooling and infrastructure. The `op-acceptor` testing tool received significant upgrades to improve performance, flexibility, and stability through the introduction of parallel execution and configurable test skip behavior. Additionally, Proxyd was updated with more granular timeout controls to better support rollup RPC requirements. In parallel, active discussions and planning continued on significant future economic features, including the "Min Base Fee" and congestion-based transaction reordering, with early implementation drafts being shared for review.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving the reliability and performance of development and testing infrastructure.

- **`op-acceptor` Testing Enhancements:** A series of updates significantly improved the `op-acceptor` tool. Parallel test execution is now enabled by default, leveraging system cores to speed up test runs ([#438](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/438)). A new flag provides flexibility by allowing test skips to be treated as skips rather than failures ([#435](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/435)). Finally, a flaky test in the `op-acceptor/runner` module was fixed, bolstering the overall stability of the test suite ([#439](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/439)).

- **Proxyd Configuration Improvements:** Proxyd's configuration was made more granular, allowing backend response timeouts to be specified in milliseconds and on a per-backend basis ([#436](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/436)). This change provides finer control and helps accommodate the need for faster RPC calls in rollup environments.

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:** Two long-standing issues concerning `op-acceptor` were closed this week, corresponding directly to the completed development work. The requests for parallel test execution ([#184](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/184)) and configurable test skip behavior ([#434](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/434)) have now been implemented.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **New:** A new issue was opened to port TestFjord to Devstack ([#440](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/440)), signaling a move to improve acceptance testing capabilities for sysgo and persistent devnets.
    - **Active - Min Base Fee:** Significant progress was noted on the `Min Base Fee` feature. An early `reth` draft implementation was shared for review in the main tracking issue ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16807)), indicating the feature is moving toward implementation. A related discussion on the specification issue ([#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/742)) highlighted the need to estimate the state growth implied by this change for inclusion in the spec's motivation.
    - **Active - Transaction Reordering:** The issue proposing a design for congestion-based builder transaction reordering ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/306)) saw renewed interest, with a community member offering to collaborate on the design.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
While the week's merged pull requests were focused, significant collaboration occurred within the issue tracker, particularly around planning for future protocol features. The discussion around the "Min Base Fee" ([#16807](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16807), [#742](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/742)) shows coordination across different workstreams and even external repositories like `reth`. Furthermore, the offer of collaboration on the congestion-based transaction reordering issue ([#306](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/306)) demonstrates active community engagement in complex design proposals.
