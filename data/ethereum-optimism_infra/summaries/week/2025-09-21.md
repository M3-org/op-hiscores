# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Sep 21 - 27, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's focus was heavily on enhancing the project's testing and validation infrastructure. Significant improvements were made to `op-acceptor`, including the introduction of a "flake-shake" mode to identify flaky tests and better logging capabilities. On the network operations front, Flashblocks were successfully enabled on Sunnyside sequencers, marking a key deployment milestone. Concurrently, the team is actively preparing for the upcoming Fusaka hard fork and refining the `superchain-ops` workflow based on user feedback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on bolstering testing frameworks and improving core service components.

- **Testing Infrastructure Enhancements:** The `op-acceptor` component received several major updates to improve test reliability and reporting. A new "flake-shake" runner mode was introduced to run tests multiple times and identify intermittent failures ([#475](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/475)). Logging and reporting were also improved by fixing output capture for subtests and adding better error handling for report generation ([#474](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/474)). A minor cleanup removed an unused function now provided by Go 1.21 ([#476](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/476)).

- **`proxyd` Service Improvements:** The `proxyd` component was updated to enable public access and authentication, increasing its security and deployment flexibility ([#424](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/424)).

- **CI/CD and Dependencies:** A new pull request was opened to update the Kurtosis SDK in `op-acceptor` ([#473](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/473)), even as the project moves away from using Kurtosis more broadly. Another PR was opened to fix an issue with the CircleCI Go releaser ([#477](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/477)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of key operational tasks and the start of discussions on future optimizations and upgrade preparations.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Kurtosis Deprecation:** A significant strategic decision was finalized with the closure of issue [#15265](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15265), officially marking the move away from using Kurtosis for devnet environments.
    - **Flashblocks on Sunnyside:** The effort to enable Flashblocks on Sunnyside sequencers was completed and the corresponding issue was closed, aligning the testnet with the mainnet configuration ([#16761](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16761)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Fusaka Hard Fork Preparation:** An active discussion is underway regarding the necessary preparations for `op-batcher` ahead of the Fusaka activation, focusing on the switch to sending blob transactions with cell proofs ([#17472](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17472)).
    - **`superchain-ops` Workflow:** Detailed feedback was provided on the `superchain-ops` signing flow, highlighting areas for UX improvement for signers and clarifying the purpose of generated artifacts and validation steps ([#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1224)).
    - **Engine API Optimization:** A new issue proposes deduplicating Engine API validation checks that are currently performed in multiple places, aiming to streamline the logic within `eth/catalyst/api_optimism.go` ([#688](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/688)).
    - **Configuration Bug:** A bug where `ChainConfig.BlobConfig` used default values was reported but immediately noted as having been fixed in an upstream dependency, with the solution pending the next merge ([#685](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/685)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in the detailed feedback loop for the `superchain-ops` tooling. The discussion in issue [#1224](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/1224) shows active engagement from users of the workflow (signers), providing practical insights to improve the operational experience. This collaborative process is crucial for refining the tools that secure and manage the Superchain. Furthermore, forward-looking discussions around the Fusaka upgrade demonstrate proactive coordination among developers to ensure a smooth network transition.
