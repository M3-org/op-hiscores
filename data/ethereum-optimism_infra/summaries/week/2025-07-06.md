# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Jul 6 - 12, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on enhancing infrastructure robustness, initiating new development, and clearing out technical backlog. Significant progress was made on `proxyd` with the introduction of improved error handling and conditional rate limiting to increase stability and control. Development officially began on a new `op-spamoor` component, while parallel work continued on refining interop logic. The team also demonstrated a commitment to focus by closing several long-standing or deprioritized issues, including those related to test reliability and `op-node` interop logic, allowing for greater attention on active priorities like fault proofs and `op-geth` performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on strengthening existing services and laying the groundwork for new tooling.

- **`proxyd` Robustness and Control**
  To improve visibility and control over network traffic, `proxyd` was updated with enhanced error handling and new rate-limiting features. A specific "499" error code was added to track client-side request cancellations ([#420](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/420)), and conditional rate limiting was implemented for transaction senders and interop, accompanied by a cleanup of transaction parsing logic ([#421](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/421)).

- **New Development and Interop Refinements**
  The initial commit for `op-spamoor` was made, marking the start of a new component ([#422](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/422)). In parallel, adjustments were made to the core protocol's interop handling by disabling validation toggles and removing awareness of certain error codes ([#423](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/423)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week involved resolving older issues and focusing discussion on critical active topics like fault proofs and performance.

- **Closed Issues:**
  Several issues were closed, reflecting progress in stability and strategic focus.
    - **Reliability & Stability:** An issue concerning the reliability of acceptance tests was closed after significant improvements were noted ([#16378](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16378)). An inactive issue regarding an `op-batcher` RPC was also closed ([#15355](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15355)).
    - **Strategic Deprioritization:** A proposal to add a pre-Interop logic mode to `op-node` was closed after being deprioritized, clarifying the team's focus ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16520)).
    - **Rapid Resolution:** An issue related to `flashblocks` acceptance testing was resolved on the same day it was opened ([#16630](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16630)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  Discussions centered on preparing fault proofs for production and addressing performance bottlenecks.
    - **New:** A new issue was opened to conduct a final review of the v3 fault proof incident runbook, signaling a move toward production readiness ([#16651](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16651)).
    - **Active Discussions:**
        - **Fault Proofs:** A detailed checklist was posted in the issue for OPCM changes to the Fault Proof creator contract, outlining the remaining tasks for this complex feature ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15789)).
        - **`op-geth` Performance:** A user provided a performance profile for an issue concerning abnormal CPU usage in `op-geth`, attributing the slowdown to an index update that took 24 hours to complete ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/613)).
        - **Protocol Clarification:** Discussion continued around the standard practice of initializing precompile addresses with a 1 wei balance to prevent them from being treated as empty accounts ([#16620](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16620)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in both strategic decision-making and user-developer interactions. The discussion and subsequent closure of the `op-node` interop issue ([#16520](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16520)) highlighted the team's process for prioritizing work. The detailed planning visible in the Fault Proof creator contract issue ([#15789](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15789)) points to close coordination on major initiatives. Additionally, the `op-geth` CPU issue ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/613)) showcased effective collaboration with the community, as a user provided valuable diagnostic data to help the team investigate a performance problem.
