# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push towards production readiness and a strategic refinement of development priorities. The team successfully advanced the mainnet rollout of flashblocks by closing numerous configuration and monitoring issues. Concurrently, there was a concerted effort to enhance the `op-acceptor` testing framework with new features and bug fixes. A major strategic shift was evident as a large number of Kurtosis-related issues were closed, signaling a de-prioritization of that tool. However, new stability concerns have emerged around `op-geth`, with an active investigation into a critical sync-crashing bug.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The focus of direct code contributions this week was on improving the `op-acceptor` acceptance testing tool, enhancing its usability and reliability.

- **`op-acceptor` User Experience Enhancements:** The testing tool received several updates to improve developer feedback. A new console progress indicator was added to provide better visibility during test execution ([#457](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/457)). The underlying code for this indicator was also refactored to remove a redundant parameter for a cleaner implementation ([#458](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/458)). Additionally, a bug related to the Go releaser when `mise` is activated was fixed, ensuring smoother operation ([#459](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/pull/459)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was a major focus, with significant progress in closing out work related to flashblocks and a strategic cleanup of the backlog.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Flashblocks Mainnet Rollout:** A large cluster of issues related to the flashblocks deployment was resolved. This included enabling flashblocks on mainnet sequencers ([#16759](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16759), [#17317](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17317), [#16760](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16760)), configuring a new sequencer with flashblocks ([#17318](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17318)), and finalizing associated monitoring and alerting ([#16868](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16868), [#16388](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16388)).
    - **Kurtosis De-prioritization:** Numerous issues related to the Kurtosis devnet environment were closed, with comments indicating that it is not a current priority. This strategic decision clears the way for focus on other areas ([#15753](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15753), [#14390](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/14390), [#15050](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/15050), [#16712](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/16712)).
    - **Test Infrastructure Cleanup:** Several obsolete Network Acceptance Testing (NAT) smoke tests for components like `op-challenger` and `op-proposer` were closed ([#141](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/141), [#143](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/143]), along with older issues related to test infrastructure ([#346](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/346), [#188](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/188)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`op-geth` Stability Concerns:** A critical new issue ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/679)) was opened for `op-geth` crashing during a full sync with "Failed to decode RLP receipts" errors. The team has confirmed the issue and is actively investigating a fix. This follows the closure of an older issue ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/613)) concerning high CPU usage, which appears to have resolved itself after an initial indexing period.
    - **`op-acceptor` Improvements:** A batch of new issues was opened to further enhance the `op-acceptor` tool. These include improving logging ([#455](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/455)), logging all configuration for reproducibility ([#461](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/461)), fixing a bug where the progress indicator fails in Kurtosis runs ([#460](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/460)), and improving package parallelism ([#462](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/462)).
    - **`op-program` Performance:** A new issue ([#17416](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/17416)) proposes adding a hint for fast block header oracle lookups in `op-program`, aiming to optimize performance.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's activity highlights a focused and coordinated effort by the core team. The systematic closure of issues related to the flashblocks rollout and the de-prioritization of Kurtosis demonstrate clear strategic alignment and execution. The burst of new, related issues for `op-acceptor` suggests a dedicated planning session or sprint focused on improving the project's testing capabilities.

Collaboration with the wider community was visible in the `op-geth` CPU usage issue ([#613](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/613)), where users provided diagnostic `pprof` profiles to aid in the investigation. The team's rapid acknowledgment and investigation of the new critical `op-geth` crash ([#679](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/infra/issues/679)) further underscores a commitment to maintaining node stability for the ecosystem.
