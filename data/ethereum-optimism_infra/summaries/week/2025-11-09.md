# ethereum-optimism/infra Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing infrastructure stability and tooling. A persistent `mise` installation error was resolved through a series of targeted fixes, and an important security update was applied to `proxyd`. A new feature was introduced to `op-acceptor` to support zstd compression, improving data handling. Meanwhile, active discussions continued on core protocol optimizations, particularly concerning `op-node`'s safe-head advancement, and on improving documentation for future network upgrades.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on bug fixes, security hardening, and a new data compression feature.

- **Infrastructure Tooling and Stability:**
  - A multi-part effort successfully resolved a recurring `mise` installation failure. The process began with adding verbose logging to CircleCI for better debugging ([#506]), followed by adopting a pattern from the Optimism monorepo to address a missing component ([#507]), and culminated in a final fix that resolved the error ([#508]).
  - A security fix was merged for `proxyd`, contributing to a more robust and stable infrastructure ([#493]).

- **Data Compression Enhancement:**
  - A new feature was implemented to add zstd compression support to `op-acceptor` images, enhancing data handling capabilities ([#505]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of a key testing milestone and deep technical discussions on active issues.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - The issue tracking the completion of Kona action tests for the Jovian upgrade was closed ([#17303]), marking a successful integration and testing milestone.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were opened this week.
  - A significant discussion is ongoing in issue [#15393] regarding the optimization of `op-node`'s safe-head advancement. Contributors are analyzing how to reduce "FCU spam" by consolidating update messages, with suggestions including logic to debounce events.
  - The need to clearly document the `cannonKonaPrestate` requirement for network upgrades is being addressed in issue [#18095]. This effort, in coordination with the devrel team, is crucial for operators preparing for upgrades like U18.
  - Issue [#18246] remains active, with discussions focused on improving safeguards when updating the batcher on the SystemConfig.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
- The resolution of the `mise` installation errors across multiple pull requests ([#506], [#507], [#508]) demonstrated a collaborative and iterative debugging effort.
- The detailed technical discussion on `op-node` optimization ([#15393]) highlights strong community engagement on core protocol mechanics, with multiple contributors like `teddyknox`, `clabby`, `sebastianst`, `SozinM`, `protolambda`, and `0x416e746e` weighing in.
- Cross-functional collaboration was evident in the `cannonKonaPrestate` documentation effort ([#18095]), which involved discussions with the devrel team to ensure clear communication for the broader ecosystem.
